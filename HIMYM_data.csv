"1","Narrator","Kids, I'm going to tell you an incredible story. The story of how I met your mother","01","01","Pilot"
"2","Son","Are we being punished for something?","01","01","Pilot"
"3","Narrator","No","01","01","Pilot"
"4","Daughter","Yeah, is this going to take a while?","01","01","Pilot"
"5","Narrator","Yes. (Kids are annoyed) Twenty-five years ago, before I was dad, I had this whole other life.","01","01","Pilot"
"6","Narrator","It was way back in 2005. I was twenty-seven just starting to make it as an architect and living in New York with my friend Marshall, my best friend from college. My life was good and then Uncle Marshall went and screwed the whole thing up.","01","01","Pilot"
"7","Marshall","(Opens ring) Will you marry me.","01","01","Pilot"
"8","Ted","Yes, perfect! And then you're engaged, you pop the champagne! You drink a toast! You have s*x on the kitchen floor... Don't have s*x on our kitchen floor.","01","01","Pilot"
"9","Marshall","Got it. Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted.","01","01","Pilot"
"10","Ted","Dude, are you kidding? It's you and Lily! I've been there for all the big moments of you and Lily. The night you met. Your first date... other first things.","01","01","Pilot"
"11","Marshall","(laughs) yeah, sorry. We thought you were asleep.","01","01","Pilot"
"12","Ted","It's physics Marshall, if the bottom bunk moves, the top bunk moves too. My god, you're getting engaged tonight.","01","01","Pilot"
"13","Marshall","Yeah, what are you doing tonight?","01","01","Pilot"
"14","Narrator","What was I doing? Your Uncle Marshall was taking the biggest step of his life, and me-I'm calling your Uncle, Barney.","01","01","Pilot"
"15","Barney","(on the phone) hey, so you know how I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls? Well, now I've got a new favorite  Lebanese girls! Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians.","01","01","Pilot"
"16","Ted","Hey, you wanna do something tonight?","01","01","Pilot"
"17","Barney","Okay, meet me at the bar in fifteen minutes, and Suit up!","01","01","Pilot"
"18","Ted","Hey.","01","01","Pilot"
"19","Barney","Where's your suit!? Just once when I say suit up, I wish you'd put on a suit.","01","01","Pilot"
"20","Ted","I did that one time.","01","01","Pilot"
"21","Barney","It was a blazer!","01","01","Pilot"
"22","Ted","You know, ever since college it's been Marshall and Lily and me. Now it's going to be Marshall and Lily... and me. They'll get married, start a family-before long I'm the weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call ""Uncle Ted"".","01","01","Pilot"
"23","Barney","I see what this is about. Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met?","01","01","Pilot"
"24","Barney","Ted, I'm going to teach you how to live. (Ted's shocked) Barney, we met at the urinal.","01","01","Pilot"
"25","Ted","Oh, right. Hi.","01","01","Pilot"
"26","Barney","Lesson one, lose the goatee. It doesn't look good with your suit.","01","01","Pilot"
"27","Ted","I'm not wearing a suit.","01","01","Pilot"
"28","Barney","Lesson two, get a suit. Suits are cool. (Points to self with bear bottle in hand) Exhibit A. (Flirts to a woman unseen) Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till you're... thirty.","01","01","Pilot"
"29","Ted","Thirty, right. You're right. I guess it's just, you're best friend gets engaged-you start thinking about that stuff.","01","01","Pilot"
"30","Barney","I thought I was your best friend. Ted, say I'm your best friend.","01","01","Pilot"
"31","Ted","You're my best friend, Barney.","01","01","Pilot"
"32","Barney","Good! And as your best friend, I suggest we play a little game called... ""Have you met Ted?""","01","01","Pilot"
"33","Ted","Wai-no, no, no. We're not playing ""Have You Met Ted?""","01","01","Pilot"
"34","Barney","(Taps a woman names Yasmine) Hi, have you met Ted? (Leaves and watches from a distance).","01","01","Pilot"
"35","Ted","(To Yasmine) Hi, I'm Ted.","01","01","Pilot"
"36","Yasmine","Yasmine.","01","01","Pilot"
"37","Ted","It's a very pretty name.","01","01","Pilot"
"38","Yasmine","Thanks, It's Lebanese.","01","01","Pilot"
"39","Marshall","Hey!","01","01","Pilot"
"40","Lily","Urgh. I'm exhausted. It was finger painting day at school, and a five year old boy (takes coat off revealing a purple hand print on her right breast) got to second base with me. Wow, you're cooking?","01","01","Pilot"
"41","Marshall","Yes, I am.","01","01","Pilot"
"42","Lily","Aww-(They kiss) Are you sure that's a good idea after last time? You looked really creepy without eyebrows.","01","01","Pilot"
"43","Marshall","I can handle this; I'm full of surprises tonight.","01","01","Pilot"
"44","Lily","So there's more surprises? Like what?","01","01","Pilot"
"45","Narrator","Marshall was in his second year of law school, so he was pretty good at thinking on his feet.","01","01","Pilot"
"46","Marshall","BOOGITY BOO! And that's all of them! I'm goanna go... cook. (Leaves)","01","01","Pilot"
"47","Ted","I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am. I just couldn't imagine settling down right now.","01","01","Pilot"
"48","Yasmine","So do you think you'll ever get married?","01","01","Pilot"
"49","Ted","Well maybe eventually. Some fall day. Possibly in Central Park. Simple ceremony, we'll write our own vows. But--eh--no DJ, people will dance. I'm not going to worry about it! Damn it, why did Marshall have to get engaged? (Yasmine laughs) Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh?","01","01","Pilot"
"50","Yasmine","Actually, I think it's cute.","01","01","Pilot"
"51","Ted","Well, you're clearly drunk (pulls her wine glass away. Hold up glass to bartender) ONE MORE FOR THE LADY!","01","01","Pilot"
"52","Marshall","Okay, look what I got (runs to the fridge. Takes out wine bottle)","01","01","Pilot"
"53","Lily","Aw-honey. Champagne! (hands it to Marshall)","01","01","Pilot"
"54","Marshall","(after short silence) Yeah. (hands it back)","01","01","Pilot"
"55","Lily","(realizing) No, you are too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne!","01","01","Pilot"
"56","Marshall","I'm not scared.","01","01","Pilot"
"57","Lily","Then open it!","01","01","Pilot"
"58","Marshall","Fine (takes bottle. Looks at it for a couple of seconds) Please open it (hands it to Lily)","01","01","Pilot"
"59","Lily","You are unbelievable, Marshall. No-(Scene splits in half and shows both Lily and Marshall on top arguing and Ted and Yasmine on the bottom mingling)","01","01","Pilot"
"60","Narrator","There are two big questions a man has to ask in life. One you plan out for months, the other just slips out when you're half drunk at some bar.","01","01","Pilot"
"61","Marshall","(To Lily) will you marry me?","01","01","Pilot"
"62","Ted","(To Yasmine) you wanna go out sometime?","01","01","Pilot"
"63","Lily","Of course, you idiot! (hugs him and they fall back)","01","01","Pilot"
"64","Yasmine","I'm sorry; Carl's my boyfriend (points to bartender)","01","01","Pilot"
"65","Ted","Sup, Carl?","01","01","Pilot"
"66","Marshall","I promised Ted we wouldn't do that.","01","01","Pilot"
"67","Lily","Did you know there's a pop tart under your fridge?","01","01","Pilot"
"68","Marshall","No, but dibs. Where's that champagne? I wanna drink a toast with my fiancé.","01","01","Pilot"
"69","Lily","aww (claps. They kiss)","01","01","Pilot"
"70","Marshall","I don't know why I was so scared of this. Pretty easy right? (Pops cork, hit's Lily's eye)","01","01","Pilot"
"71","Lily","(YELLS)","01","01","Pilot"
"72","Marshall","(covers mouth) OH!","01","01","Pilot"
"73","Ted","Why am I freaking out all of a sudden? This is crazy! I'm not ready to settle down.","01","01","Pilot"
"74","Barney","(ignoring) how does Carl land a Lebanese girl?","01","01","Pilot"
"75","Ted","It's always been ""don't even think about it till you're thirty""","01","01","Pilot"
"76","Barney","Exactly-the guy doesn't even own a suit!","01","01","Pilot"
"77","Ted","Plus Marshall's found the love of his life. Even if I was ready, which I'm not, but if I was it's like, ""Okay, I'm ready! Where is she?"" (Spots Robin)","01","01","Pilot"
"78","Narrator","and there she was.","01","01","Pilot"
"79","Narrator","It was like something from an old movie. Where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor, turns to his buddy and says, ""see that girl? I'm going to marry her someday""","01","01","Pilot"
"80","Ted","Hey Barney, see that girl?","01","01","Pilot"
"81","Barney","(to Robin) Hey, have you met Ted?","01","01","Pilot"
"82","Robin","Let me guess, (points) Ted?","01","01","Pilot"
"83","Marshall","I'm sorry, Lily. I'm so sorry. Take us to the hospital.","01","01","Pilot"
"84","Cabdriver","Whoa, whoa, whoa-did you hit her?","01","01","Pilot"
"85","Lily","Hit me? Please, this guy could barely even spank me in bed for fun. He's all like, (hits ice in bag using to cover eye) ""Oh, did that hurt?"" and I'm like, ""Come on, let me have it you pansy!"" (realizes) Wow, complete stranger.","01","01","Pilot"
"86","Cabdriver","no, no, no, no-it's okay, go on. (Turns meter on.) So these, spankin's...you in pajamas or going ""naturelle""","01","01","Pilot"
"87","Ted","So what do you do?","01","01","Pilot"
"88","Robin","I'm a reporter for Metro News 1.","01","01","Pilot"
"89","Ted","(nods) Oh.","01","01","Pilot"
"90","Robin","Well, kind of a reporter. I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news, you know. Like-um-monkey that can play the ukulele. I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon.","01","01","Pilot"
"91","Ted","Bigger like, uh, gorilla with an up-right bass? Sorry, you're really pretty. (Robin laughs and waves to her friends) Oh, your friends don't seem too happy.","01","01","Pilot"
"92","Robin","Yeah, see the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend so tonight every guy is... ""The enemy"".","01","01","Pilot"
"93","Ted","You know if you don't make your friend feel better you could throw a drink at my face. I don't mind.","01","01","Pilot"
"94","Robin","She would love that! It does look fun in the movies.","01","01","Pilot"
"95","Ted","Hey, you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?","01","01","Pilot"
"96","Robin","Oh, I can't. I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday. Some guys attempting to make a big (cut) so my news is covering it.","01","01","Pilot"
"97","Ted","That's going to take a week?","01","01","Pilot"
"98","Robin","Yeah, he's going to eat it too, it's another record.","01","01","Pilot"
"99","Robin's Dumped Friend","Hey, what's taking so long?","01","01","Pilot"
"100","Ted","Uh, I know this is a long shot, but how about tomorrow night?","01","01","Pilot"
"101","Robin","(stops) Yeah, (agrees) What the hell (passes number to Ted. Throws drink on Ted's face) JERK! (Walks away. Whispers) that was fun.","01","01","Pilot"
"102","Barney","(comes back laughing) De-wait for it-nied! Denied!","01","01","Pilot"
"103","Ted","We're going out tomorrow night.","01","01","Pilot"
"104","Barney","I thought we were playing laser tag tomorrow night?","01","01","Pilot"
"105","Ted","Yeah, I was never going to go play laser tag. (Wipes alcohol off his face)","01","01","Pilot"
"106","Narrator","The next night, I took her out to this little bistro in Brooklyn.","01","01","Pilot"
"107","Robin","Wow that is one bad-ass blue French horn.","01","01","Pilot"
"108","Ted","Yeah.","01","01","Pilot"
"109","Robin","Mhmm.","01","01","Pilot"
"110","Ted","Sort of looks like a... Smurf pen1s.","01","01","Pilot"
"111","Narrator","Son, a piece of advice. When you go on a first date you really don't wanna say ""smurf pen1s"". Girls don't ordinarily like that.","01","01","Pilot"
"112","Narrator","But that was no ordinary girl.","01","01","Pilot"
"113","Marshall","Lilly?","01","01","Pilot"
"114","Lily","How long have you been sitting there!? Stupid eye patch.","01","01","Pilot"
"115","Ted","Mom, dad, I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby! Marshall, how have I always described my perfect woman?","01","01","Pilot"
"116","Marshall","Oh let's see (thinks) she likes dogs?","01","01","Pilot"
"117","Robin","I've got five dogs.","01","01","Pilot"
"118","Marshall","...she drinks scotch?","01","01","Pilot"
"119","Robin","I love a scotch that's old enough to order its own scotch.","01","01","Pilot"
"120","Marshall","Can quote obscure lines from ""Ghostbusters""?","01","01","Pilot"
"121","Robin","Ray, when someone asks you if you're a god you say, ""Yes!""","01","01","Pilot"
"122","Ted","And I'm saving the best for last.","01","01","Pilot"
"123","Robin","Do you want these? (Holding up remaining olives from her plate) I hate olives.","01","01","Pilot"
"124","Marshall","She hates olives! Awesome!","01","01","Pilot"
"125","Lily","The olive theory.","01","01","Pilot"
"126","Ted","The olive theory is based on my friends, Marshall and Lily. He hates olives, she loves them. In a weird way that's what makes them such a great couple. A Perfect balance (eats olive).","01","01","Pilot"
"127","Robin","You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever.","01","01","Pilot"
"128","Ted","(flirting) I can take them off your hands.","01","01","Pilot"
"129","Robin","(flirting back) they're all yours.","01","01","Pilot"
"130","Marshall","Oh, it is on! It is on (imitates robot) till the break of dawn.","01","01","Pilot"
"131","Lily","wait, it's only the break of ten-thirty. What happened?","01","01","Pilot"
"132","Robin","I've gotta get one of those blue French horns for over my fireplace. It's gotta be blue, it's gotta be French.","01","01","Pilot"
"133","Ted","No Green Clarinet?","01","01","Pilot"
"134","Robin","No.","01","01","Pilot"
"135","Ted","Come on, no purple tuba?","01","01","Pilot"
"136","Robin","It's a smurf pen1s, we're no dice.","01","01","Pilot"
"137","Producer","(from inside van) there you are! We've got a jumper! Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge. Come on, you're covering it!","01","01","Pilot"
"138","Robin","Um, alright. I'll be right there. (To Ted) I'm sorry. I had a really great time tonight.","01","01","Pilot"
"139","Ted","Yeah.","01","01","Pilot"
"140","Marshall","So? Did you kiss her?","01","01","Pilot"
"141","Ted","No. The moment wasn't right. (They sigh) Look, this woman could be my future wife; I want our first kiss to be amazing.","01","01","Pilot"
"142","Lily","Aww, Ted that's so sweet. So you chickened out like the little bitch.","01","01","Pilot"
"143","Ted","What? I did not chicken out! You know what? I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate who hasn't been single since the first week of college.","01","01","Pilot"
"144","Lily","Ted, anyone who's single would tell you the same thing. Even the dumbest single person alive, and if you don't believe me...call him.","01","01","Pilot"
"145","Barney","(Phone) Hey loser, how's not playing laser tag? Because playing laser tag is awesome! Oh, I killed you Connor; don't make me get your mom!","01","01","Pilot"
"146","Ted","Hey, listen. I need your opinion on something.","01","01","Pilot"
"147","Barney","Okay, meet me at the bar in fifteen minutes-AND SUIT UP!","01","01","Pilot"
"148","Ted","So these guys think I chickened out. What do you think?","01","01","Pilot"
"149","Barney","I can't believe you're still not wearing a SUIT!","01","01","Pilot"
"150","Ted","She didn't even give me the signal.","01","01","Pilot"
"151","Barney","What is she goanna-is she goanna bat her eyes at you in Morse code (bats eyes)?? Ted (bats eyes) Kiss me-No, you just kiss her!","01","01","Pilot"
"152","Ted","Not if you don't get the signal.","01","01","Pilot"
"153","Barney","Ee-(Kisses Marshal) Did Marshall give me the signal?","01","01","Pilot"
"154","Marshall","No! (To Lily) I didn't, I swear.","01","01","Pilot"
"155","Barney","But see-at least, tonight, I get to sleep knowing, Marshall and Me... never going to happen. You should've kissed her.","01","01","Pilot"
"156","Ted","Urgh, I should've kissed her. What about when she gets back from Orlando?","01","01","Pilot"
"157","Barney","A week? That's like-a year in hot girl time. She'll forget all about you. Mark my words  you will never see that one again.","01","01","Pilot"
"158","Ted","There she is...","01","01","Pilot"
"159","Lily","Ooo. She's cute! (To Carl) Hey Carl, turn it up!","01","01","Pilot"
"160","Robin","(on TV)...persuaded him to reconsider at which point the man came down off the ledge, giving this bizarre story a happy ending. Reporting from","01","01","Pilot"
"161","Marshall","Huh, guy didn't jump","01","01","Pilot"
"162","Robin","(on TV) Metro One News, back to you bill.","01","01","Pilot"
"163","Ted","I'm goanna go kiss her. Right now.","01","01","Pilot"
"164","Marshall","Oh-Dude, it's midnight. As your future lawyer I'm goanna advise you  that's freakin' crazy!","01","01","Pilot"
"165","Ted","I never do anything crazy! I'm always waiting for the moment! Planning the moment! Well she's leaving tomorrow this may be the only moment I'm goanna get! I gotta do what that guy couldn't, I gotta take the leap! Okay not a perfect metaphor, for me it's fall in love and get married-for him it's... death.","01","01","Pilot"
"166","Barney","Actually, that is a perfect metaphor. By the way, did I congratulate you two? (Raises glass to Lily and Marshall)","01","01","Pilot"
"167","Ted","I'm doing this. (Starts to leave)","01","01","Pilot"
"168","Lily","Let's go (pulls Marshall up)","01","01","Pilot"

"182","Ted","Marshall, remember this night. When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech, you're goanna tell this story. (exits cab)","01","01","Pilot"
"183","Barney","Why does he get to be the best man? (Shouts out) I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND!","01","01","Pilot"
"184","Narrator","As I walked up to that door a million thoughts raced through my mind. Unfortunately, one particular thought did not.","01","01","Pilot"

"199","Barney","(Whispers to Marshall) Simple no would have sufficed. (To Ranjit) She's lovely.","01","01","Pilot"
"200","Robin","So, Ted. What brings you back to Brooklyn at one in the morning in a-suit.","01","01","Pilot"
"201","Ted","I was just hoping to get those olives... that you said I could have.","01","01","Pilot"
"202","Robin","Would you like those olives with some Gin and Vermouth?","01","01","Pilot"
"203","Ted","Are you trying to get me drunk?","01","01","Pilot"
"204","Robin","For starters (turns music on. Leaves to the kitchen)","01","01","Pilot"
"205","Ted","(Looks up and mouths) Thank you.","01","01","Pilot"
"206","Barney","So, Marshall. This ""Olive Theory"" based on you and Lily?","01","01","Pilot"

"208","Barney","You hate olives? Lily loves them, you can't stand them.","01","01","Pilot"
"209","Marshall","Yeah, hate olives.","01","01","Pilot"
"210","Barney","Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th Street, dish of olives-you had some. What up?","01","01","Pilot"
"211","Marshall","(looks around for sign of Lily) You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.","01","01","Pilot"
"212","Barney","I swear.","01","01","Pilot"
"213","Ranjit","(Cuts into conversation) I swear.","01","01","Pilot"
"214","Marshall","On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad; Lily asked if she could have my olives. I said, ""Sure... I hate olives.""","01","01","Pilot"
"215","Barney","But you like olives!","01","01","Pilot"
"216","Marshall","Well, I was eighteen, okay? I was a virgin. Been waiting for my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives.","01","01","Pilot"
"217","Barney","Marshall, I'm going to get you an early wedding present. Don't get married.","01","01","Pilot"
"218","Robin","I think I like your ""Olive Theory"".","01","01","Pilot"

"225","Barney","Come on man, you said your stomach's been hurting, right? You know what that is! Hunger. You're hungry for experience. Hungry for something new. Hungry for olives. But you're too scared to do anything about it.","01","01","Pilot"
"226","Marshall","Yeah, I'm scared, okay? But when I think about spending the rest of my life with Lily... committing forever, no other women (Lily appears behind Marshall in the open window) doesn't scare me at all. I'm marrying that girl. (Lily pops her head in from the window. Marshall turns around) Lily. Lily, I like olives.","01","01","Pilot"
"227","Lily","We'll make it work. (They kiss.)","01","01","Pilot"
"228","Ranjit","aww.","01","01","Pilot"
"229","Ted","So Orlando, you goanna hit Disney World?","01","01","Pilot"
"230","Robin","You love me?","01","01","Pilot"
"231","Ted","Oh, god, I can't believe I said that. Why did I say that? Who says that? I should just go. (Gets up)","01","01","Pilot"
"232","Robin","Hold on. (Gets up) Wait a minute. (Hands him Olives) Promised you these.","01","01","Pilot"
"233","Ted","Olives. Thanks. I love you. What's wrong with me?","01","01","Pilot"
"234","Barney","Why are we still sitting here? Let's go! We can still make last call. What do you say Lil? (Pirate Accent) Yo, ho ho and a bottle o' rum? (Silence) 'Cuz you're a pirate...","01","01","Pilot"
"235","Lily","Okay, eye patch gone-(takes eye patch off and throws it at Barney) And we can't just abandon Ted. If it doesn't go well up there he's gonna need some support.","01","01","Pilot"
"236","Marshall","It's been like twenty minutes. You think they're doin' it?","01","01","Pilot"
"237","Barney","You think they're doing it in front of the dogs?","01","01","Pilot"
"238","Marshall","Doggie style. (Laughs)","01","01","Pilot"
"239","Barney","I had this girl in college; she had a golden retriever-","01","01","Pilot"
"240","Lily","Okay, we can go to the bar, just stop talking.","01","01","Pilot"
"241","Barney","Hit it Ranjit. (They drive off)","01","01","Pilot"
"242","Ted","So when you tell this story to your friends, could you avoid the word ""psycho""? I prefer...eccentric.","01","01","Pilot"
"243","Robin","Good night, psycho (smiles). (Ted sarcastically clutches heart. Realizes friends left him)","01","01","Pilot"
"244","Ted","Great (before Robin closes the door) Umm... how do I get to the F Train?","01","01","Pilot"
"245","Robin","Oh, um-two blocks (comes out) that way (points) and take a right.","01","01","Pilot"
"246","Ted","(upset/tired) Thanks. (Walks down the steps. Robin begins to walk in) You know what? (Robin stops. Ted turns around). I'm done being single. I'm not good at it. Look, obviously you can't tell a woman you just met you love her. But... it sucks that you can't. I'll tell you something though, if a woman-not you... just some hypothetical woman-were to bare with me through all this. I think I'd make a damn good husband. Because that's the stuff I'd be good at. Stuff like making her laugh and being a good father... and walking her five hypothetical dogs. Being a good kisser.","01","01","Pilot"
"247","Robin","Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.","01","01","Pilot"
"248","Ted","Oh, I've got references.","01","01","Pilot"
"249","Robin","Good night, Ted. (Shake hands.)","01","01","Pilot"
"250","Ted","And I'm a good hand shaker","01","01","Pilot"
"251","Robin","that's a pretty great hand shake. (Looks him in the eyes)","01","01","Pilot"
"252","Ted","And that was it, probably never see her again. (Silence) What?","01","01","Pilot"
"253","Marshall","That was the signal!","01","01","Pilot"
"254","Lily","That long lingering handshake-you should've kissed her!","01","01","Pilot"
"255","Barney","There's no such thing as the signal. But yeah-that was the signal.","01","01","Pilot"
"256","Rangit","Signal (nods)","01","01","Pilot"
"257","Marshal","Ah, Carl thank you. Something I gotta do.","01","01","Pilot"
"258","Carl","By the way, you should've kissed her.","01","01","Pilot"
"259","Ted","Carl!? (turns to friends) You guys weren't there.","01","01","Pilot"
"260","Lily","I am so turned on right now.","01","01","Pilot"
"261","Ted","Guys, trust me. I've seen the signal. That was not the signal.","01","01","Pilot"
"262","Barney","Yeah Ted, we're not on you anymore.","01","01","Pilot"
"263","Marshall","(Toasting) To my fiancé!","01","01","Pilot"
"264","Lily","(smiles) to the future!","01","01","Pilot"
"265","Ranjit","To one hell of a night!","01","01","Pilot"
"266","Ted","That was not the signal!","01","01","Pilot"
"267","Narrator","I asked her about it years later, and yeah, that was the signal. I could've kissed her. But that's the funny thing about destiny.","01","01","Pilot"
"268","Narrator","... it happens whether you plan it or not. I mean I...","01","01","Pilot"
"269","Narrator","... never thought I'd see that girl again. But it...","01","01","Pilot"
"270","Narrator","...turns out, I was just too close...","01","01","Pilot"
"271","Narrator","...to the puzzle to see the picture that was forming. Because that kids...","01","01","Pilot"
"272","Narrator","...is the true story, of how I met your Aunt Robin.","01","01","Pilot"
"273","Son","Aunt Robin?","01","01","Pilot"
"274","Daughter","I thought this was about how you met mom!","01","01","Pilot"
"275","Narrator","Will you relax? I'm getting to it. (Son and daughter sit back unpleased) like I said","01","01","Pilot"
"276","Narrator","...it's a long story.","01","01","Pilot"
"277","Narrator","Okay, where was I?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"278","Daughter","You were telling us how you met mom.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"279","Son","In excruciating detail...","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"280","Narrator","Right, so (While Flashbacks take place) back in 2005 when I was twenty-seven, my two best friends got engaged. And it got me thinking, ""Maybe I should get married."" Then I saw... Robin. She was incredible. I just knew I had to meet her. That's where your Uncle Barney came in.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"281","Barney","I suggest we play a little game I like to call, ""Have you Met Ted?""","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"282","Ted","No, no, no-we're not playing ""Have you Met Ted!""","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"283","Barney","(Taps Robin's shoulder) Hi! Have you met Ted? (Leaves)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"284","Narrator","So I asked her out, and I know this sounds crazy... but after just one date, I was in love with her, which made me say something stupid","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"285","Ted","I think I'm in love with you.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"286","Robin","What?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"287","Daughter","Oh, Dad.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"288","Son","So then what happened?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"289","Narrator","Nothing. I mean, I made a complete fool of myself. So... a week went by and I decided not to call her.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"290","Marshall","So you're not goanna call her? You went from, ""I think I'm in love with you"" to ""I'm not gonna call her?""","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"291","Ted","I wasn't in love with her, okay? I was briefly in love with the abstract idea of getting married! That had absolutely nothing to do with Robin. (Finds Lily and Robin chatting at a table.) Robin!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"292","Robin","Hey!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"293","Lily","Look who I ran into!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"294","Ted","Since when do you guys know each other?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"295","Robin","Uh... since about (points to glass) here. Lily recognized me from the news and-(Lily and Marshall kiss) Hello, Sailor!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"296","Ted","They just got engaged.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"297","Robin","Well, I should get back to the station. See you guys. (Marshall raises a hand while still kissing Lily) Nice seeing you, Ted.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"298","Ted","Yeah, you too. (Robin leaves, Barney walks closer) Damn it.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"299","Lily","What?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"300","Ted","I'm in love with her.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"301","Barney","(hits him) No! As your sponsor I will not let you relapse. You blew it; it's over-move on.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"302","Ted","I don't know! I just have this feeling. She's the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"303","Ted","Lily, you squeaked?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"304","Ted","She said something about me didn't she? Come on, spill it, Red.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"305","Lily","Fine!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"306","Lily","So what do we think of Ted?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"307","Robin","(laughs) Ted's something else.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"308","Ted","Huh... I'm gonna spin that as good. Lots of guys are ""something"", I'm ""something else"".","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"309","Robin","Comes on a little strong.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"310","Ted","But...that's part of my charm.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"311","Lily","But that's part of his charm.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"312","Robin","Oh, totally. I mean, he's sweet, he's charming, he's just looking for something a little bit more serious than I am. I mean the most I can handle right now is something casual. This just stays between us, right?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"313","Lily","Are you kidding? This flapper-for knocks.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"314","Lily","(shy) Oops...","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"315","Ted","She wants casual. Okay, I'll be casual. I'm gonna be a mushroom cloud of casual. You know why? Cause it's a game! I wanted to skip to the end and do the ""happily ever after"" thing but you don't get there unless you play the game.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"316","Marshall","So're you gonna ask her out?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"317","Ted","Yeah-No! I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out I'm asking her out. So how do I ask her out, without asking her out? (thinks)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"318","Lily","Did you guys get high?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"319","Ted","I got it! I don't ask her out... I invite her to our party next Friday.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"320","Marshall","We're having a party next Friday?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"321","Ted","We are now-Casual","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"322","Barney","Yeah, cuz nothing says ""Casual"" like inviting a hundred people over just to ""Mac"" on one girl. Oh, and Lily-that's my leg.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"323","Lily","You waited five minutes to tell me that?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"324","Marshall","Alright-so call her up!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"325","Ted","No-calling's not casual! I just gotta bump into her somewhere. If only I knew her schedule I could arrange a ""chance"" encounter.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"326","Lily","that's great, Ted. You'll be the most ""Casual"" stalker ever.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"327","Narrator","Now ever since Marshall put that ring on her finger, Lily had been...well... extra affectionate.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"328","Marshall","Baby, no. I have a twenty-five paged paper on unconstitutional law due on Monday, I barely started,","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"329","Lily","Hey, I'm just sitting here. Wearing my ring... my beautiful ring. Kind of makes wearing other stuff seem wrong. Like my shirt. Kind of don't wanna wear my shirt anymore. Or... my underwear. Oh-that's right-I'm not wearing any.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"330","Marshall","(Closes laptop screen) No underwear?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"331","Lily","Not slightly.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"332","Ted","Guys, boundaries! There she is!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"333","Robin","(on TV) Thanks Bill, I'm reporting from the Razzle Dazzle Supermarket on 75th in Columbus","01","02","Purple Giraffe"

"338","Robin","(To cameraman) Thanks. (Notices Ted) Ted?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"339","Ted","(Turns around nonchalant) Robin, wow! What are the odds?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"340","Robin","What are you doing here?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"341","Ted","Oh, you know, just-uh-Shopping for-uh-dip (holds dip) I love dip... I mean I don't love dip, I like dip. As a friend, you know. So-uh-hey, you-uh-reporting a news story or something? (puts dip back)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"342","Robin","Yeah, kid stuck in a crane machine, how sweet of you to call it news.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"343","Ted","Wow, kid in a crane machine (approached machine. To boy) You just had to have that toy didn't ya? Couldn't play the game like everyone else.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"344","Leroy","You're all sweaty!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"345","Ted","Cute kid (wipes forehead) Um yeah it's f-it's so funny running into your we're having a party next Friday if-if you like swinging by! But, you know, whatever.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"346","Robin","Oh, I'm going back home next weekend. It's too bad it's not tonight.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"347","Ted","(Shocked) It is, it's tonight. This Friday, Did I say next Friday? Yeah-sorry-cuz I've been saying ""next Friday"" all week, but yeah it's tonight. The-uh-party's tonight. But, you know, whatever.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"348","Marshall","Hello?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"349","Ted","(on Phone) hey, am I interrupting anything? (Holding party mixes)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"350","Marshall","No, no I'm just writing my paper. Hitting the books.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"351","Ted","(on Phone) Yeah, well you and Lily might wanna put some clothes on. We're throwing a party in two hours. Okay, bye (hangs up)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"352","Marshall","So, Gatsby, what are you goanna do when Robin shows up?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"353","Ted","Okay, I got it all planned out.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"354","Ted","She steps through the door, and where's Ted? Not eagerly waiting by the door. Nah I'm across the room at my drafting table showing some foxy young thing all my cool architecture stuff. So Robin strolls over and I casually give her one of these, ""Hey, what's up?"" She says, ""Hey, nice place"" etcetera, etcetera. And then I say, ""Well make yourself at home,"" and I casually return to my conversation. Then, an hour later, ""Oh, you're still here?"" I say like I don't really care, but it's a nice surprise. And then very casually, ""Wanna see the roof?""","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"355","Lily and Marshall","(Gloating) The roof.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"356","Ted","Get her up to the roof and the roof takes care of the rest.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"357","Barney","What's so special about the roof?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"358","Lily","Oh, the moon, the stars, the shimmering skyline. You can't not fall in love on that roof.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"359","Marshall","We do it up there sometimes.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"360","Barney","Solid plan, my little friend.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"361","Ted","We're the same height.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"362","Barney","But may I suggest one little modification.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"363","Barney","That foxy young thing you were chatting up, take her up to the roof and have s*x with her! Crazy monkey-style.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"364","Ted","That's not the plan.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"365","Barney","Should be the plan, I mean look at her. Ted, look at her. She's smokin'!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"366","Fantasy Girl","Thank you.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"367","Ted","Yeah, but she's not Robin.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"368","Barney","Exactly! Ted, let's wrap. Statistic, at every New York party there's always a girl who has no idea whose party she's at. She knows no one you know, and you will never see her again. Do you see-where I'm going-hu-with this?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"369","Ted","Barney, I don't wanna say-","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"370","Barney","Aargh! (Pulls down imaginary scope) Scoping, beep, scoping, beep!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"371","Lily","Man you're a dork.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"372","Barney","beep, beep, beep, beep. Target acquired! And now it's time we play a little game I like to call ""Have You Met Ted?""","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"373","Ted","No, come on not this.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"374","Barney","(taps woman) Hi! Have you met Ted?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"375","Tatiana","No.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"

"380","Barney","Hmm, do you know anyone at this party?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"381","Tatiana","I work with Carlos.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"382","Barney","Excuse me, (to group) Anyone know a Carlos?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"

"384","Lily","No.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"385","Barney","On a silver platter! Bon appetite!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"386","Ted","I don't think so.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"387","Barney","Your loss, her gain. (To Tatiana) Excuse me, can I show you the roof? It's magical up there!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"388","Tatiana","Sure (Smiles)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"389","Ted","Whoa-whoa-Hey hey. I got that roof reserved!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"

"393","Lily","At least it was a great party.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"394","Marshall","I ate like four whole cans of dip!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"395","Ted","You always know what to say old friend.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"396","Ted","It's Robin.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"397","Lily","Answer it!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"398","Ted","No, no, no. Not right away. I gotta seem casual. (Answers phone) Hello?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"399","Robin","(on Phone) I'm so sorry I missed your party.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"

"404","Ted","Did he get to keep the purple giraffe?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"405","Robin","(on Phone) Yeah, they let him keep all the toys. He was in there a long time and little kids have smaller bladders.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"406","Ted","(scoffs)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"407","Robin","(On Phone) I wish your party was tonight.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"408","Ted","It is the party's tonight. (Marshall's mad) Yeah-uh-it's a two day party. Because that's just how we roll. Uh-so if you wanna swing by its-uh-you know, Casual. See ya. (hangs up) So that was Robin.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"409","Marshall","What are you doing to me, man. I got a paper to write.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"410","Ted","I know I'm sorry. It's terrible (grabs coat) I'll buy more dip (runs out)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"411","Marshall","TED! TED WAIT-GET FRENCH ONION. (Closes door) Can you believe this guy, I got a paper to write. (Lily smiles) Okay, fine-(they walk into the bedroom) but it's gotta be like super quick.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"412","Lily","Oh!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"413","Marshall","And no cuddling after.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"414","Lily","I'm the luckiest girl alive (runs into bedroom. Marshall strips.)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"415","Barney","Oh, you were so right about the roof. The roof. The roof is on fire, Ted! Girl from last night, took her back to my place then this morning took her outside, spun her around a couple of times sent her walking-she will never find her way back and there she is. How did she get here? Did you invite her?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"416","Ted","I have no idea who that is.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"417","Barney","She said she works with Carlos, who's Carlos?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"

"425","Ted","Oh, that was fast.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"426","Barney","Yeah, I was trying to think what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"427","Barney","I think I'm in love with you.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"428","Tatiana","What?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"

"453","Lily","Hey little old books. Ready for a little fifteen minute recess?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"454","Marshall","Sorry, baby, I gotta work. I need all my blood (points to brain) up here. Has anybody seen an introduction to contract work institution statutes from 1865 to 1923? (Silence) Anybody seen a big-ass book?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"455","Crowd","(mutters) No, no.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"456","Tatiana","Hello, Barney.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"457","Barney","Of course.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"458","Tatiana","You look well. Isn't it weird they invited both of us?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"459","Barney","Who? Who invited you? No one even know who you are!","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"460","Tatiana","I understand you're hurt, but, you don't have to be cruel. Carlos was right about you.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"461","Barney","Who is Carlos!?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"462","Marshall","Okay, where the hell is my-OHH! (Book has been used as coaster, all wet) Okay, introduction to contract work institution statutes from 1865 to 1923...is not a coaster! Ted! I'm jeopardizing my law career so that you can throw not one, not two, but three parties for some girl that you just met who's probably not gonna show up. (Ted's shocked) I mean where is she, Ted, huh? Where's Robin? (Finds Robin) Hi! Hi Robin. (Throws book on the floor and grabs Lily for s*x)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"463","Robin","so you threw all these parties for me?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"464","Ted","No! Oh you thought that-oh, no! I c-okay yes. You got me-I-(laughs)-one of the reasons I threw these parties was so that I could introduce you to uh-(Barney throws Ted a random guy) this guy. I figured, you know, since it didn't work out between us and now we can just laugh about it (nervously laughs)-Anyway Robin, this is.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"465","Carlos","Carlos (shake hands)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"466","Barney and Ted","Ohhh.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"467","Ted","She's still talking to Carlos. I can still win this, it's not over.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"468","Lily","Okay, buddy, time for the ""tough-talk"". Robin seems great. But let's look at the facts, you wanna get married and right now there's a million women in New York looking for exactly you, but Robin ain't one of them.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"469","Ted","She's not just ""one of them"" she's the one.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"470","Barney","Yeah well, ""the one"" is heading up to ""the roof"". (Robin leaves to the roof with Carlos)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"471","Marshall","What are you gonna do?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"472","Ted","Nothing. It's a game, I gotta just-keep playing it.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"473","Robin","Hey.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"474","Ted","Hey. Carlos, can you give us a minute?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"475","Carlos","Hey, no sweat hombre.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"476","Ted","Robin, look I didn't invite you to this party to set you up with Carlos. Or the one before that. Or the one before that. (Robin smiles) I threw these parties because I wanted to see you.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"477","Robin","Well, here I am.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"478","Ted","There's something here, look, unless I'm crazy.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"479","Robin","(exhales) you're not crazy. I-I don't know, Ted, I mean we barely know each other and you're looking at me with that look and it's like-(struggles)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"480","Ted","Like what?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"481","Robin","like-let's fall in love, and get married and have kids and drive them to soccer practice.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"482","Ted","I'm not gonna force sports on them unless they're interested.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"483","Robin","(laughs) It's a great look. But you're looking at the wrong girl.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"484","Ted","No, I'm not.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"485","Robin","Yes, you are. I don't wanna get married right now, maybe ever and if we got together I'd feel like I'd either have to marry you or break your heart and-I just couldn't do either of those things. Just like you can't turn off the way you feel.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"486","Ted","(reaches in his Jacket) Click. Off. Let's make out.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"487","Robin","(laughs) What?","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"488","Ted","What? That was the off switch! And I turned it off. I mean sure yes, I wanna fall in love get married blah, blah, blah, but-on the other hand... you... me...the roof.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"489","Robin","There's no off switch.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"490","Ted","There is an off switch... and it's off.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"491","Robin","(smiling) no, it's not.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"492","Ted","(silence) yes, it is. (They draw closer)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"493","Robin","No (smiles)...it's-not.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"494","Ted","Yes-it is (they kiss long) No it's not. You're right, there's no off switch. God I wish there was an off switch.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"495","Robin","(sighs) me too.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"496","Ted","So (They mutter together. Then laugh)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"497","Robin","we could be friends (shrugs)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"498","Ted","Oh (clutches heart)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"499","Robin","look, I know it sounds insincere when people say that but... we could.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"500","Ted","I don't know, Robin. I made such a jackass out of myself here, every time we start hanging out it'll be like, ""Oh-that's right-I'm a jackass.""","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"501","Robin","You're not a jackass. I'm sorry. I only moved here in April and I'm always working and-I just haven't met a lot of good people so far. But I understand.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"502","Ted","Well-uh-maybe in a few months after it's not so fresh, we could all-uh...you know, get a beer.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"503","Robin","yeah. (sighs) That sounds good. I'll see you, Ted. (walks away)","01","02","Purple Giraffe"
"504","Ted","Or, you know-now. (Robin looks at Ted) We could all get a beer now.","01","02","Purple Giraffe"

"653","Barney","(To Ted) No! No! The night is just started. Look, airport bar. Flight attendants! They'll get your tray table at its full upright position. Say what? (Goes for a high five)","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"654","Officer McNeil","Passengers Mosby and Stinson? Please come with us, gentlemen. Keep your hands where I can see them.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"655","Ted","Barney, I am going to kill you.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"656","Barney","Don't say you're going to kill someone in front of airport security, not cool. (To security) Not cool.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"657","Barney","This is an outrage. We are international businessmen on an international business trip. I demand you release us immediately.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"658","Ted","You demand!? No, no, no, no, no... he does not demand. We... we... we have no demands!","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"659","Officer McNeil","Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to remain calm.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"660","Ted","(Whispering) Okay, yeah. I'm calm... I'm totally calm.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"661","Officer McNeil","We got footage of you placing two bags on JFK carousel three, and abandoning them to purchase a last minute flight with cash.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"662","Barney","(To Ted) Those bags were your responsibility.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"663","Ted","They were your bags.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"664","Officer McNeil","Sir, please. We're assessing the bag situation.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"665","Ted","Look, this is all just... it's a misunderstanding.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"666","Barney","(Stopping him) Please. (Silence) We are international businessmen. My colleague accidentally left the bags there now please let us go before we miss our international business meeting.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"667","Officer McNeil","Can't remember the last time I saw an international business man with an untucked shirt. In addition, we received this footage taken over the last few months.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"668","Barney","Believe it or not, that duff bag thing worked.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"669","Ted","Truth is, my friend... he does this thing where he goes to airports with fake luggage to pick up girls and we followed some here to Philadelphia. That's it! That's all this is!","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"670","Officer McNeil","Nobody's that lame.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"671","Ted","Yes, he's that lame. Tell them you're that lame!","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"672","Barney","We are international businessmen...","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"673","Ted","OH COME ON!","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"674","Officer McNeil","Sir! Lower your voice or we'll restrain you.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"675","Barney","Dude, seriously, relax.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"676","Ted","We at least get to call our lawyer.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"677","Barney","Exactly! (To Ted) We have a lawyer?","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"678","Marshall","(On Phone) Listen to me, you're both American citizens. Don't let them pull any patriot-act voodoo. You both retain the right to refuse to answer any questions without an attorney present so don't say anything until I get there, alright? Okay, goodbye (Hangs up. Sings) To Philly! The adventure continues! Destroy!","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"679","Robin","It's ridiculous in here, why don't we go somewhere else?","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"680","Lily","(Unbuttoning sweater) No, this place is great (positions mouth in an inviting kiss position)","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"681","Robin","What are you doing?","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"682","Lily","What?","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"683","Robin","With your lips and everything...?","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"684","Lily","My lips are always like this (drinks martini and drops it all over her blouse)","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"685","Ted","You had to play the race card.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"686","Barney","Relax, Ted. We didn't do anything wrong. And, B.T.W, we'd be out of here by now if you'd have tucked in your shirt. (Ted turns his head to face away from Barney)","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"687","Officer McNeil","Go ahead, JFK... what is the baggage status?","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"688","Bomb Squad Guy","They're clean. It's just a whole bunch of condoms... and a power bar.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"689","Officer McNeil","You're free to go.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"690","Ted","(On Phone) Don't come to Philly.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"

"746","Robin","You wanna be single? (Laughs) You wanna fight off loser guys all night, does that seem like fun to you?","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"747","Lily","I guess I wanted to throw this net back into the ocean and see how many fish I could catch. So far, one. One gay dolphin. (Smiles)","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"

"766","Barney","Ted, Ted... you're not even looking.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"767","Ted","No, I'm not.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"768","Barney","Look, our forefathers died for the pursuit of happiness, okay. Not for the sit around and wait of happiness. Now if you want, you can go to the same bar, drink the same beer talk to the same people everyday, or you can lick the Liberty Bell! You can grab life by the crack and lick the crap out of it!","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"769","Cabdriver#2","That was beautiful, man!","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"770","Barney","Thanks, Leonard. Ted, you're missing out on a valuable life lesson!","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"771","Ted","Look, I don't need you to teach me how to live, okay. I know how to live. If you want to go lick the Liberty Bell just go lick it yourself.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"772","Barney","No, it has to be the two of us.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"773","Ted","Why? Why do you need me?","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"774","Barney","Because, you're my best friend, alright? You don't have to tell me I'm yours. But the way I see it, we're a team. Without you, I'm just the dynamic uno. You know what, fine. If you wanna go home... then we'll go home.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"775","Ted","Fine...we'll go lick the Liberty Bell!","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"776","Barney","Good, (smiles) 'cuz we're here! (Hops out)","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"777","Ted","(voice) I had no idea how Barney redirected the cab without me knowing, but we got out, Dana let us in and by god we licked the Liberty Bell. And you know what it tastes like?","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"778","Cute Girl","What?","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"779","Ted","Freedom... No actually it tasted like pennies.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"780","Cute Girl","(laughs) My, god. Did you guys really do that?","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"781","Narrator","We really did and that was when I realized why I hung out with Barney. I never got where I thought I wanted to go, but I always got a great story.","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"
"782","Daughter","So, that girl you were talking to... that was mom?","01","03","Sweet Taste of Liberty"

"786","Narrator","Kids, when you're single all you're looking for is happily ever after. But only one of your stories can end that way. The rest end with someone getting hurt. This is one of those stories, and it starts... with a shirt.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"787","Daughter","A shirt?","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"788","Narrator","Just listen...","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"789","Narrator","Because none of this would have happened if it hadn't have been for that shirt.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"790","Ted","(mouths) Wow.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"791","Robin","Nice shirt!","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"792","Ted","Right? Right?","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"793","Lily","Look at those colors! Green and brown together at last!","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"794","Marshall","Hot top, Bro, is it new?","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"795","Ted","That's the crazy part. I've had this shirt for, like, six years... Until this morning I wasn't into it at all, but now it's like my tastes have changed.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"796","Barney","Booger.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"797","Ted","Yes, hello, Barney.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"798","Robin","Barney's offering me fifty bucks to say some stupid word on a live news report.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"799","Barney","Not some stupid word, ""Booger"".","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"800","Robin","But I'm not doing it, I am a journalist.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"801","Barney","What? Journalist? You do the little fluff pieces at the end of the news. Old people, babies, monkeys... that's not journalism, that's just things in a diaper.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"802","Robin","For your information, my boss is about to bump me up to the City Hall beat.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"803","Lily","City hall, Miss Thang!","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"804","Robin","So I'm not going to jeopardize my promotion by saying ""Booger"" for fifty bucks.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"805","Barney","Of course not, because now you're saying ""Nipple"" and it's a hundred! (Whispers) Step into my web.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"806","Ted","(Sipping drink) Mmm... Who's bourbon is this?","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"807","Lily","Ooh, I don't know. It was here when we sat down.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"808","Ted","Aaah, point is. I seem to like bourbon now. I could have sworn I hated bourbon. First the shirt, now bourbon. I spent twenty-seven years making up my mind about things, right? The movie I saw once in Haden, the city I'll never go back to because it was raining the day I visited. Maybe it's time to start forming some second impressions...","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"809","Marshall","You're finally gonna watch ""Goonies AGAIN? Slow love, Chuck"".","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"810","Ted","(Laughs) Not Goonies, girls. What if there's someone from my past, who I thought was wrong for me at the time, but in fact she, like my shirt, is actually a perfect fit?","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"811","Barney","Hold up, there are only two reasons to date a girl you've already dated. Breast, Implants.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"812","Lily","That's not a bad idea. Let's think, Ted's greatest hits... what about that girl, Steph?","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"813","Ted","Steph...","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"814","Stefanie","Okay, this is difficult to say, back when I lived in LA, I was pretty broke, so I spent a month making adult films.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"815","Ted","Wow, okay... how many did you make?","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"816","Stefanie","A-hundred-and-seventy-five.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"817","Lily","Say what you will about the p0rn industry... they are hard workers.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"818","Marshall","What about that chick...um...Jackie?","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"819","Ted","And my bathing suit had fallen completely off.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"820","Jackie","(laughs with Ted) I know the feeling, once... when I was sixteen, I was driving, and I hit this hitchhiker. Don't know what happened to him... just kept drivin'! (Laughs)","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"821","Ted","Uh...no.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"822","Lily","What about Natalie!","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"823","Marshall and Ted","Natalie!","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"824","Robin","Who's Natalie?","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"825","Narrator","Natalie, I had so many fond memories of her. The tea candles on her dresser. The sock monkey collection on her bed. That one Belle and Sebastian song that she always listened to. Her smile.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"826","Ted","Man, I haven't seen her in like three years!","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"827","Robin","Well why'd you guys break up?","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"828","Ted","I just wasn't looking for a big commitment at the time, of course now a big commitment doesn't seem so bad... maybe I should call her? What do you guys think?","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"829","Barney","You dumped a p0rn star? Friendship over (gets up) FRIENDSHIP OVER!","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"830","Mr. Adams","Come in, (On Phone) Alright, I'll get back to you. (Hangs up)","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"831","Robin","You wanted to see me, Mr. Adams?","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"832","Mr. Adams","Yes, I did. I need you to cover a story. (Nods) It's down at City Hall.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"833","Robin","City Hall? (Pans In) Oh, my god.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"834","Robin","So, next time you're passing City Hall, make sure and stop by New York's oldest hotdog cart. Today a delicious hotdog will cost you $2.50, but back when the stand first opened in 1955, you could get one for only a nipple. Reporting live, Robin Scherbatsky, Metro News One.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"835","Robin","I said, ""Nipple"" on the news! That was so unprofessional! I said, ""Nipple"" on the news!","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"836","Lily","At least it's better than booger. (Laughs) Booger.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"837","Barney","There she is. Hey is it cold in here, because I can kind of see Robin's nickels? Now for your next challenge...","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"838","Robin","No, there is not going to be another challenge, I don't care how much you offer me.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"839","Barney","Oh, search your soul, Robin. You and I both know this wasn't about the money. Sure, Metro News One pays you jack and hey, a little green salad on the side's good for you, me and Mr. McGee.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"840","Lily","Seriously, who talks like that?","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"841","Barney","Well baby really likes, is the thrill of pulling one over on those bean counters, who under appreciate you and still haven't promoted you. And for two more hundy-sticks, baby's going to look in the camera and say this (Whispers in her ear)","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"842","Lily","Eew. I'm just assuming.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"843","Robin","(sighs) I gotta get back to work. See ya.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"

"879","Marshall","Okay, in my client's defense. Is there an unterrible way to break up with somebody? No. Personally I'd rather hear the bad news on an answering machine than face the humiliation in person. (Lily Picks up her phone) It's the least painful way you can do it.

"954","Lily","Why? What is so horrible about that?","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"955","Ted","Yeah, what is so horrible about that?...""She's not the one."" Why is that such a heart-breaking thing to hear? The chances of one person being another person's ""The one"" are like six billion to one.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"956","Lily","Yeah, you have better chances of winning the lottery.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"
"957","Ted","Exactly, you wouldn't take it personally if you lost the lottery.","01","04","Return of the Shirt"

"1070","Lily","I don't know, I just felt embarrassed. Claire is my age, and she and her husband do all these classy grownup stuff. Maybe we should start doing some grownup stuff.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1071","Marshall","That was some pretty grownup stuff we did this morning.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1072","Lily","(Laughs) Yeah, but it wasn't classy. Maybe we should have a wine tasting party.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1073","Marshall","I like wine. I like tasting. You know I can party, let's do it. Let's rock it, maturity style!","01","05","Okay Awesome"

"1106","Claire","Ah! (Laugh)","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1107","Marshall","Ah, no I think we're going to wait on the baby thing. I mean I love babies. Babies rule. Pudgy arms and stuff, but they make you old. Kind of like this anchor weighing you down to one spot...forever.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1108","Claire","I'm three month's pregnant.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1109","Marshall","I don't know guys. It's not awkward unless we let it be awkward.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1110","Ted","This place seems great. Is Kelly here?","01","05","Okay Awesome"

"1124","Lily","(to guests) Let's start drinking!","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1125","Chris","Oh, not so fast. In order for the tannins to mellow, you should let it breathe for about thirty minutes.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1126","Marshall","Freaking ten ends.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1127","Robin","(To VIP room doorman. Subtitle) Robin Scherbastky? (Door man shakes head) Robin Scherbatsky! (Doorman refuses. Robin walks away)","01","05","Okay Awesome"

"1131","Kelly","(Subtitle) I would love one. Just a beer! (Imitates shooter. Ted mouths ""Oh, okay"" and leaves)","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1132","Marshall","You know what they're doing in there right now? They're watching Claire's ultrasound video and I swear to god even the baby looks bored.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1133","Lily","Come on, it's not that bad. We're really starting to click with these guys. Claire and Austin just invited us to their fondue fest next Saturday night.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1134","Marshall","You're also trying to get me excited about fondue?","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1135","Lily","It's dipping stuff in hot cheese, what's not to love?","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1136","Marshall","Okay, that does sound good. But it's dipping stuff in hot cheese with boring people.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1137","Lily","Marshall, it's time for us to grow up.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1138","Narrator","Marshall knew she was right. He had to stop acting like a kid.","01","05","Okay Awesome"

"1147","Claire","Oh, yeah. Norah Jones just gets better and better.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1148","Lily","Please tell me we can drink the wine now.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1149","Chris","Five more minutes, we don't want to rush to tannins.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1150","Lily","Freaking tannins.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1151","Ted","(Subtitle) You really like this place? (Kelly nods. Subtitle) You have no idea what I'm saying, do you? I'm from outer space! I got thrown out of Sea World for humping a dolphin!

"1193","Robin","Hey.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1194","Lily","Marshall just ditched out on our own party. Can you get me in there? I kind of need to kill him.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1195","Robin","Actually, I can't even get myself in. I was such a dork. I get recognized one time and I start thinking I'm Julia Roberts. No VIP. I'm not even an IP. I'm just a lonely little P sitting out here in the gutter.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1196","Lily","Know something; I'd take a pee in the gutter over Julia Roberts any day. (They realize it sounds gross and laugh)","01","05","Okay Awesome"

"1205","Coat Check Girl","Rough night?","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1206","Ted","Yeah, these clubs are supposed to be fun, right? Why do I hate them so much?","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1207","Coat Check Girl","Because all of the stuff you're supposed to like... usually sucks. Like these clubs or cruises.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1208","Ted","Or New Year's Eve.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1209","Coat Check Girl","Or the Super Bowl.","01","05","Okay Awesome"

"1214","Ted","I really hate parades. (Laughs)","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1215","Lily","He just left, in the middle of our own party, you don't do that. Unless, of course, you're chasing after someone who's already done it, and then I think it's okay.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1216","Robin","Well, I hate to take his side... but come one a wine tasting? What's the big plan for next Saturday, scrabble night?","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1217","Lily","Don't check your email.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1218","Robin","Why are you becoming this person? I heard that in college you flashed a campus tour group on a dare.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1219","Lily","Once on a dare. The other times were just for fun. I'm not in college anymore. I'd love to go back and be that person again, but you can't move backwards you can only go forward.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1220","Robin","Um, pause... you can go wherever you want. I guess the question is where do you want to go?","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1221","Lily","I want to go into this club and find my fiancé.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1222","Robin","Well that you can't do. (Silence)","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1223","Lily","Wanna bet? (They get up) Follow my lead. (To doorman) Hey, big guy. (Flashes doorman, geeks watching.) I said follow my lead.","01","05","Okay Awesome"

"1226","Bradley","Those were the four greatest and only breasts I have ever seen.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1227","Coat Check Girl","Yeah, see, everyone keeps telling you something is supposed to be fun, it's usually not.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1228","Ted","Right.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1229","Coat Check Girl","Right!","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1230","Ted","So, by that logic, if you and I were to, say, go out on a date.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1231","Coat Check Girl","Then we couldn't go anywhere that's supposed to be fun.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1232","Ted","Right. The DMV it is.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1233","Coat Check Girl","Then we'll get our teeth cleaned.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1234","Ted","Sounds awful, it's a date.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1235","Coat Check Girl","(laughs) Okay.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1236","Ted","But there's still one big question that needs to be answered.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1237","Ted","How many of these coats do you think I could put on all at once?","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1238","Chris","Okay, this question is for the wedge. (Takes a question card)","01","05","Okay Awesome"

"1243","Barney","That was my cousin, Leslie.","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1244","Ted","(laughs) What?!","01","05","Okay Awesome"
"1245","Barney","No, no, no... we are not laughing about this, Ted. This is not going to be some funny story that we'll be telling in a couple months. It's not gonna be like, ""Hey, remember that time when you were grinding with... NO! And you know why? Because, italics, this night did not happen. And you promise me that you will never, ever, ever tell another soul what transpired here tonight. You promise. Promise","01","05","Okay Awesome"

"1274","Marshall","Tarzan nipple blue.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1275","Barney","You know what I love about Halloween? It's the one night of the year chicks use to unleash their inner ho-bag. If a girl dresses up as she a witch, she's a slutty witch. If she's a cat, she's a slutty cat. If she's a nurse...","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1276","Lily (interrupting)","Wow, we get it.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"

"1281","Robin","No, I mean, he's not my boyfriend. He's just this guy I've been seeing for a couple of weeks.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1282","Lily (in a sing-song voice)","Boyfriend.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1283","Marshall","So why haven't we met him?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1284","Robin","We're not really ready to go public yet.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1285","Barney (in a sing-song voice)","Married.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1286","Lily","How about we go about a Halloween double-date?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1287","Robin","I don't know, we were kinda thinking about staying at home and dressing up as naked people.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1288","Lily","Come on, Robin, trot our your new fella. Let us judge and evaluate him behind your back. It'll be fun.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1289","Marshall","Hey, Ted, you'll never guess what happened?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1290","Ted","Your costumes came.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1291","Marshall","Our costumes...yes, that is why we're best friends.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1292","Robin","Hey, Ted, what are you doing for Halloween?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1293","Ted","Well.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1294","Marshall, Lily, Barney","Awww.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1295","Robin","What?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1296","Lily","Every Halloween Ted waits for the Slutty Pumpkin.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1297","Ted","That's right.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1298","Robin","What's the Slutty Pumpkin?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1299","Ted","You mean, who is the Slutty Pumpkin? It was four years ago.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1300","Ted","I was at this Halloween party up on the roof of our building. I'm about to call it an early night when out of nowhere appeared this girl in the sexiest pumpkin costume.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1301","Robin","Wait, how can a pumpkin costume be sexy?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1302","Ted","It was carved in strategic places.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1303","Ted","So, uh, we're at the bar and I see her mix kahlua...","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1304","Lily","Kahlua and root beer","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1305","Marshall","A cocktail she invented herself.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1306","Ted","And she...","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1307","Barney","And she called it the Tootsie Roll.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1308","Lily, Marshall, Barney","Because it tastes like an alcoholic Tootsie Roll.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1309","Ted","Hey, can I please tell this story? So we had this instant connection. She gave me her number, but then something...","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1310","Marshall, Lily, Barney","Something went terribly wrong.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1311","Ted","Guys! Something went terribly wrong.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1312","Lily","Happy Halloween.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1313","Ted","Sonny, where's Cher?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1314","Lily","Cher?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1315","Marshall","Right here, babe.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1316","Ted","I just met the perfect woman. She's funny. She's beautiful. She loves Star Wars.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1317","Marshall","Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. What's her take on Ewoks?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1318","Ted","Loves them.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1319","Marshall","Oh good. I don't know why people are so cynical about Ewoks. The Rebellion would have failed without the Ewoks.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1320","Ted","Get this, she's a marine biologist. She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1321","Marshall","Oh, penguins are cool, kinda like black and white Ewoks. I approve.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1322","Ted","Hey, where's my, uh, Kit Kat? I put it right here on this table.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1323","Lily","I don't know, but we have plenty of chocolate here.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1324","Ted","No no no, you don't understand. I need that Kit Kat. She wrote her number on that wrapper. Where is it?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1325","Lily","Uh-oh.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1326","Ted","Hey, Dracula. Come on. Give me your candy. Gimme!","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1327","Ted","Where's the Kit Kat? Where's the Kit Kat!","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1328","Ted","Never found her number, never saw her again. But every year they have a Halloween party up on the roof so that's where I'll be.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1329","Barney","You know, Ted, it's been four years. She could be engaged or married or, God forbid, fat.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1330","Ted","I don't know, I got a feeling. This could be the year. Halloween is a night of wonder and magic.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1331","Ted","OK, bring the mockery. Fine, I can take it. Come on, wouldn't it be the coolest story ever if the Slutty Pumpkin turned out to be my future wife?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1332","Lily","Oh, on the off chance that that could happen, maybe we should stop calling her the Slutty Pumpkin.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1333","Lily (from bedroom)","Ted, is your world ready to be rocked? (echo) rocked-rocked-rocked.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1334","Ted","Can't wait.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1335","Marshall","So, what do you think?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1336","Lily","(repeats like a parrot) So, what do you think? (squawks)","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1337","Ted","Wow! Marshall, you wearing eye liner?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1338","Marshall","Oh, yeah. Weirdly hot, right?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1339","Lily","We are so gonna win the costume contest this year.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1340","Marshall","First prize, $50 gift certificate at the bar.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1341","Ted","And how much did you pay for your costumes?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1342","Marshall","$100","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1343","Lily","(like parrot) Each.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1344","Ted","Well, I think you guys look great.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1345","Lily","What are you going as? Oh, like I even have to ask.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1346","Ted","Hey, I want the Slutty Pumpkin to recognize me and she knows me as a hanging chad.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1347","Ted","What? She thought it was hilarious.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1348","Lily","Yeah, four years ago, but nobody remembers what the hell a hanging chad is.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1349","Marshall","What a sad commentary on our national attention span that we could forget such a turbulent time in our political history.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1350","Lily (like parrot)","Sad commentary. (squawks)","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1351","Lily","All right, Polly gotta pee.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1352","Marshall","Again?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1353","Ted","Where are you going?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1354","Marshall","It's an elaborate costume.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1355","Barney","No, no, not again. Not this year. You're going as my wingman. Flight suit up!","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1356","Ted","No thanks. I'm sticking with the hanging chad.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1357","Barney","Oh you're dangerous, Maverick. Your ego's writing check your body can't cash. OK. Here's the plan, and I crap you not. I'm getting us into the Victoria's Secret Halloween party. Trust me, by the end of the night, your chad will not be hanging.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1358","Ted","We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year. Tonight, I'm going up to the roof, I'm gonna have a few beers, I'm gonna wait for the Slutty Pumpkin. That's just what I do.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1359","Barney","Hm, (putting up left hand) Victoria's Secret models prancing around in bras and panties, or (putting up right hand) Yale preppies reuniting their stupid a capella group. What's that left hand? Right hand sucks? Word.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1360","Ted","I'm heading up to the roof.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1361","Barney","Well, boys, looks like it's just the three of us. What's that? Self-five? Nice. (high fives himself) We out.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1362","Robin","Hey, Chad, how's it hanging?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1363","Ted","Hey, word play. Funny.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1364","Robin","(to Barney as he walks by her out the door) Whoo.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1365","Robin","(to Lily) Nice outfit.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1366","Lily","I'm a parrot.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1367","Robin","You sure are.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1368","Lily","Where's Mike?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1369","Robin","He's meeting me here. I ran late covering the Halloween parade in the Village. There are like a zillion gay pirates this year.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1370","Marshall","Seriously, does my eye liner look OK?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1371","Lily","Yes, it's weirdly hot.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1372","Lily (to Robin)","So, where's your costume?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1373","Robin","Uh, you know, Mike and I joked about doing something together but we decided not to dress up.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1374","Robin","Oh, geez.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1375","Mike","Hi.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1376","Robin","Ah, everyone, this is Michael. Th-that is not his real hair.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1377","Mike","Where's your costume, Gretel?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1378","Robin","You thought I was...Oh, I was just kidding. I gotta stop making jokes in e-mails. It's so hard to convey tone.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1379","Marshall (aside to Lily)","I think we got them beat.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1380","Barney","I can't believe you talked me into this.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1381","Ted","I didn't. You followed me up here.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1382","Barney","This party sucks. There are seven chicks here.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1383","Barney","There are six chicks here.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1384","Ted","Relax, the night is young. It's gonna get better.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1385","King Costume Guy","Ladies and gentlemen, as on-pitch as they were at Spring Fling '95, it's my pleasure to welcome back the Shagarats.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1386","Shagarats","(singing) My bonnie lies over the ocean. My bonnie lies over the sea. My bonnie lives over the ocean. Oh bring back my bonnie to me...","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1387","Barney (talking like pirate)","What be a pirate's favorite kind of sweater?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1388","Lily","Arr-gyle.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1389","Barney (talking like a pirate)","And what be a pirate's favorite fast food restaurant?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1390","Lily","Arrr-by's","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1391","Barney (talking like a pirate)","Would think it would be Arby's, (talking normal) but actually it's Long John Silver's.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1392","Robin","Actually I kinda need this hand to eat.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1393","Mike","Oh.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1394","Lily, Robin","Oh yeah. Oh, thank you","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1395","Marshall (like pirate)","Starrr-ving","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1396","Lily","It's so nice to meet you, Mike. You guys are really cute together.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1397","Mike","Yeah, we've been spending a lot of time together. We're even getting to that point where we finish each other's (stops talking, waiting for Robin to finish sentence)","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1398","Robin","This cheeseburger is so...","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1399","Mike","Good. See.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1400","Lily","I think you won the dish-off tonight, baby. This steak totally bitch-slapped my pork chop.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1401","Marshall","That might be true but your rice pilaf kicked my spinach in the crotch so hard it threw up a little bit.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1402","Mike","(holding a fork of food out) Robin, you have to try this chicken.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1403","Robin","Oh, well, that's good. I'm OK, thanks.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1404","Mike","Really tasty.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1405","Robin","I'm just really feeling this cheeseburger.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1406","Mike","Come on, just try a little bite.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1407","Robin","Dude, I'm kind of in the zone here.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1408","Lily","Oh for God's sake. (Lily grabs Mike's hand and eats food from his fork)","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1409","Lily","Really tasty.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1410","Barney","Hey.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1411","Hula Girl","Hey.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1412","Barney","So, what does a fella have to do to get lei'd around here? Yeah.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1413","Hula Girl","Right, cuz I'm wearing a lei.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1414","Barney","It isn't funny if you explain the joke.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1415","Barney","Let's bail.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1416","Ted","Oh, Barney, come on, I'm having fun. It's really great seeing these guys again.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1417","Barney","Name one person you know at this party.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1418","Ted","Well, there's ninja, back of horse. Where's front of horse? That guys a riot. Where is he?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1419","Barney","OK, I'm leaving, but just know that this Victoria's Secret party is on a yacht. And what will be sticking to that yacht? The Barnacle. (points to self)","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1420","Ted","Really? That's the nickname now?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1421","Barney","Yeah, the Barnacle.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1422","Ted","The Barnacle.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1423","Barney","That's it. Barnacle out. (Barney walks away)","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1424","Ted","Have fun, Barnacle.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1425","Robin","So, do you like Mike?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1426","Lily","Do you like Mike?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1427","Robin","Of course I do. Why?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1428","Lily","It just doesn't seem like it. You won't share your food. You won't wear a costume.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1429","Robin","Ah, Lily, you know me, I'm just not into all that couple-y stuff.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1430","Lily","OK, I know that stuff looks dumb from the outside, but it's kinda the greatest thing in the world when you're a part of it. If you just give it a chance, you might like it.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1431","Robin","Are you trying to get me to join a cult?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1432","Lily","Robin, Mike likes you. If you don't start meeting him halfway, you're gonna lose him.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1433","Robin","What?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1434","Lily","Look, it's Halloween. Just put on the girlfriend costume for the night.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1435","Robin","OK, what am I supposed to do? Buy him a giant teddy bear or something?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1436","Lily","How about you start by sharing dessert.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1437","Robin","I can share dessert. He better want the brownie sundae, but yeah, yeah, I can totally share.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1438","Ted","Barney. What, you're back?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1439","Barney","That's right.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1440","Ted","In a totally new costume.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1441","Barney","Every Halloween, I bring a spare costume in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party. That way I have a second chance to make a first impression.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1442","Barney","What's with the face?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1443","Ted","It's half you're pathetic, half I have to pee.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1444","Barney","So go to the bathroom.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1445","Ted","No, there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the Slutty Pumpkin.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1446","Barney","So pee off the roof. Ooh, Ted, pee off the roof.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1447","Angel Guy","Whoa, I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's people walking down there.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1448","Barney","Come on, Ted, who are you going to listen to? Me or Mr. Goody-goody over there.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1449","Angel Guy","Yeah, whatever. You guys got some weed?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1450","Robin","A little to the left, Marshall. Lily, squat down.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1451","Marshall","This is gonna be a slaughter. None of these other costumes even come close to ours.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1452","Lily","Take the damn picture. (squawks)","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1453","Robin","Got it.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1454","Marshall","I still think we should have won as Sonny and Cher. Maybe if I had worn that red dress. Ha! If I could turn back time.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1455","Robin","Wow, this sundae looks so good I could eat the whole thing.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1456","Robin","But, um, I would much rather share this small, one-scoop sundae with you, Mike.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1457","Marshall","Apple tart, excellent choice, Lilypad.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1458","Lily","Thanks, Marshmallow.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1459","Robin","Well, let's dig in, Mi... Mi... Microwave Oven.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1460","Barney","Let me guess. Every guy has used the lei'd line on you tonight.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1461","Hula Girl","You wouldn't believe.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1462","Barney","I apologize for my gender. Let me make it up to you. Make you a drink.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1463","Hula Girl","You certainly are a charming devil.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1464","Barney","I'm also a horny devil. (pointing to horns on top of head) Yeah.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1465","Hula Girl","No.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1466","Barney (to Angel Guy)","Oh, go to hell.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1467","Mike","You know, if you guys like tiramisu we found this little Italian place...","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1468","Robin","No, you found it. I came with you. Go on.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1469","Mike","I'm just saying we love tiramisu.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1470","Robin","I cannot get enough of it.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1471","Mike","We're crazy for this stuff.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1472","Robin","I'm crazy and you're crazy for tiramisu.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1473","Mike","We love tiramisu. Am I wrong in saying that.?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1474","Robin","No, no, no, I mean it just sounds a little bit weird, doesn't it? We love tiramisu. Is it really a group activity, loving tiramisu? Right?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1475","Marshall","So this Italian place? How's their cannoli?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1476","Robin","See there, hungry.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1477","Mike","Yeah, looks like we're both hungry.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1478","Robin","Hey, is that Gary Oldman? (pointing behind Mike and Marshall)","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1479","Mike","Wait, where?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1480","Mike","I don't see...","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1481","Robin","Brain freeze.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1482","Barney","OK Victoria's Secret party right now.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1483","Ted","Nope.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1484","Barney","Come on, I can't stand to watching my delusional friend waste another precious Halloween. The Slutty Pumpkin is not coming.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1485","Ted","She might.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1486","Barney","Oy.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1487","Ted","Come on, Barney, this is not about the odds, this is about believing. This girl, she represents something to me, I don't know, hope.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1488","Barney","Wow. I did not understand a word you just said. Lingerie models on a boat!","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1489","Ted","(shrugs) See ya.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1490","Barney","No, see ya. (evil laughs, sparks something in his hands) Ow.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1491","Robin","Wanna drink the melty part?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1492","Mike","You know what, it's getting late. I think I'm gonna take off.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1493","Robin","Hey, I thought we were gonna follow those bread crumbs back to my place, Hansel","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1494","Mike","Robin, I don't get the sense you like being with me.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1495","Robin","I like being with you.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1496","Mike","Not as much as you like being alone. You like eating your own food, sleeping in your own bed, doing your own crosswords.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1497","Robin","Well, who uses ink? Sorry. OK, I'm a bit set in my ways. That doesn't mean that this won't work.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1498","Mike","Actually, it kinda does.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1499","Robin","Wait, are we breaking up?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1500","Mike","We aren't breaking up. I'm breaking up with you.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1501","Future Ted VO","And then just when I was about to lose hope.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1502","Ted","She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1503","Future Ted VO","Kahlua, root beer, could this penguin be the Slutty Pumpkin?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1504","Ted","Uh, excuse me, this is gonna sound crazy, but I met someone up on this roof four years ago and they mixed that cocktail and they loved penguins. By any chance, was that you? It's you. I was crazy but I can't...","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1505","Barney","You are such a loser. Come on, I came back for you, Ted. I penguin-suited up to show you the error of your ways. And to score hula girl's number. Check and check.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1506","Ted","Unbelievable.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1507","Barney","Yes, it is.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1508","Hula Girl","Wait a minute. You're that lame army guy.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1509","Barney","What? No no, that's some other guy and he was a kick-ass fighter pilot","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1510","Hula Girl","I cannot believe I gave you my number","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1511","Barney","Yeah, well, you did, thanks.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1512","Hula girl","Well, give it back.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1513","Barney","Uh, I don't think so. I earned it fair and square. I'm calling you.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1514","Hula Girl","But I'm never gonna go out with you.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1515","Barney","But how will you know it's me? I'm a master of disguise. Yeah.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1516","Ted","Nice.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1517","Barney","Come on, Ted, Victoria's Secret party now. Let's go.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1518","Ted","I'm staying.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1519","Barney","Fine. Fine. (puts his flipper up towards Ted)","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1520","Ted","What are you doing?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1521","Barney","I'm flippering you off.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1522","Lily","Sweetie, I'm so sorry.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1523","Robin","Seriously it's not a big deal. He wanted to be a 'we,' and I wanted to be an 'I'. Dudes are such chicks. You guys, I'm fine.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1524","Carl","Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in. And the winners of this year's costume contest are Lily Aldrin as a parrot and Marshall Eriksen as a gay pirate.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1525","Marshall","Oh yeah!","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1526","Marshall","Wait. What did he say?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1527","Lily","Oh, who cares, Marshall? We won!","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1528","Marshall","Gay pirate, where are you getting that from?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1529","Carl","Dude, you're wearing eye liner.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1530","Marshall","OK, I just want everybody here to know that I'm not a gay pirate. I have s*x with my parrot all the time. That came out wrong. Oh yeah, it doesn't matter! We won!","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1531","Lily","I love you, Marshmallow.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1532","Marshall","I love you too, Lilypad.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1533","Robin","You guys, let me get a picture.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1534","Robin","I had a feeling I'd find you here.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1535","Ted","Hey. If you're here for the Shagarats, you just missed the fourth encore.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1536","Robin","I never played any team sports","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1537","Ted","Are we playing 'I never' cuz there's nothing left but peach schnapps.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1538","Robin","I played tennis in high school. You know why? Because it was just me out there. I couldn't even stand playing doubles. I just got dumped.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1539","Ted","Man, that sucks.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1540","Robin","Yeah, it's OK. I wasn't that into him. Story of my life. Everyone else is all falling in love and acting stupid and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me. Why don't I want that more? I want to want that. Am I wired wrong or something?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1541","Ted","No. Look, you didn't want to be with me so clearly you have abysmal taste in men.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1542","Ted","But you're wired just fine.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1543","Robin","Well, what if I'm just a cold person? Tonight, Mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but I couldn't be Gretel. Why can't I be Gretel?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1544","Ted","Because you just haven't met the right Hansel yet. One day you're gonna meet a guy who's gonna make you want to look like a complete idiot.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1545","Robin","Really?","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1546","Ted","Yeah, he's out there somewhere, just like the Slutty Pumpkin. (echoes) pumpkin-pumpkin...","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1547","Robin","How do you do this, Ted? How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1548","Ted","Well, I'm pretty drunk. Look, I know that odds are the love of my life isn't going to magically walk through that door in a pumpkin costume at 2 43 in the morning but it seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know, sit and wait.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1549","Robin","Scoot.","01","06","Slutty Pumpkin"
"1550","Future Ted","Kids, before I met your mother, when I was still out there searching, I learned something valuable, that love is not a science.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1551","Daughter","Wow, that was a great story, Dad.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1552","Son","We're gonna go watch TV.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1553","Future Ted","You see, sometimes in life, you just have to accept that certain things can't be explained. And that's kinda scary.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1554","Marshall","Oh my God.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1555","Lily","I know, I'm still shaking.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1556","Barney","What the? Haha, joke's on you, I have a cold.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1557","Robin","Are you guys OK? Marshall (yelling over to bartender)  Another round and back it up for me and Lily.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1558","Ted","What happened?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1559","Marshall","We saw something, up in the apartment.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1560","Lily","Something bad.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1561","Marshall","I don't know what it is, but margaritas make me sexy.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1562","Lily","Oh, mucho sexy. You quiero Marshall.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1563","Lily","Oh my God.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1564","Ted","What was it?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1565","Marshall","Only the craziest, meanest looking mouse you've ever seen.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1566","Lily","Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse. That was a huge cockroach.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1567","Marshall","Baby, it was a mouse. It had a whiskers.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1568","Lily","But those things coming out of his head, those were antennae","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1569","Barney","Marshall ran away from a cockroach.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1570","Marshall","It, it was a mouse.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1571","Barney","Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1572","Robin","Ooh, my story's on. Ted, pay attention. Carl, turn it up.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1573","Robin","I'm here with Ellen Pierce, New York's premiere matchmaker. Ellen, your company, Love Solutions boasts a 100% success rate. What's your secret?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1574","Ellen","Science. Everything in life can be broken down to ones and zeros, even love.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1575","Robin","Love Solution's Ellen Pierce, a beacon of hope for New York city's lovelorn. Robin Scherbatsky...","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1576","Barney","Was that chick at the end really a client?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1577","Robin","Yes.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1578","Barney","We're signing up.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1579","Ted","What?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1580","Barney","Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot. That's a perfect cocktail. Shake well, then sleep with.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1581","Ted","I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up. It's the man version of getting a cat.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1582","Marshall","No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur and only mammals have fur.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1583","Lily","It was a cockroach.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1584","Marshall","Come on, Lily, the only way that that was a cockroach was if it was wearing the skin of a mouse it just killed.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1585","Lily","Oh my God.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1586","Barney","Come on.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1587","Barney","Ted, hurry, you gotta help me. My boat is sinking.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1588","Ted","What?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1589","Barney","My boat is sinking.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1590","Ted","You have a boat?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1591","Ted","Your boat is sinking. That was good.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1592","Barney","Come on, Ted, this is an incredible opportunity. We'll meet our soulmates, nail 'em and never call them again. (chuckles)","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1593","Ellen","All finished, gentlemen? Congratulations, you have just taken your very first step.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1594","Barney","Gosh, thanks, Ellen. I sure hope this works. I'm so done with the single life, all the games, the meaningless s*x.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1595","Ellen","You deserve more.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1596","Barney","That is so true, Ellen. I really think I'm ready to stop being a me and start being a we.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1597","Ellen","Oh, of course you can. That is so...","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1598","Barney","It's kinda hard to talk about with Ted here, but I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night when the tears come. Ellen, can you help me find her?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1599","Ellen","Get out.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1600","Barney","What?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1601","Ellen","I get 15 guys like you every week. Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call them again.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1602","Barney","Oh my God, people do that.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1603","Ellen","You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1604","Barney","What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1605","Ellen","That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1606","Barney","OK, Ted, let's go.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1607","Ellen","Not you, you stay.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1608","Ellen","You're cute. You're an architect. Good career and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application like your friend, Jack Package.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1609","Barney (through office door)","It's pronounced 'Pa-kojj.'","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1610","Ellen","Get outta here!","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1611","Ellen","You I can work with. You give me three days and I will find the woman you will marry.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1612","Ted","Ah, no thanks. I don't need an algorithm to meet women. It's New York City. You know, plenty of fish in the sea.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1613","Ellen","Plenty of fish in the sea. Yes, there's 9 million people in New York, 4.5 million women. Of course you wanna meet someone roughly your own age, let's say, plus minus 5 years. So if we take into account the most recent census data, that leaves us with 482,000. But, uh, wait","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1614","Ted","That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1615","Ellen","There are 8 fish in that big, blue ocean, Ted. And if you feel confident that you can reel one into your boat without me, there's the door.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1616","Ted","Do you take credit cards?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1617","Lily","OK, it's back and this time we got a good look.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1618","Barney","Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1619","Marshall","It's bigger now. It's been feeding.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1620","Lily","We were just upstairs watching TV.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1621","Marshall","Ah gosh.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1622","Lily","OK, let's do this.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1623","Marshall","Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1624","Barney","So did you get a good look at it?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1625","Lily","Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton like a roach...","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1626","Marshall","But it has mouse-like characteristics. Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1627","Robin","So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1628","Lily","It's a cockamouse.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1629","Robin","What?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1630","Lily","It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know...","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1631","Barney","Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1632","Robin","That's impossible. That simply can't happen.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1633","Lily","Oh, but it can.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1634","Marshall","And it has","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1635","Lily","And it's pissed.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1636","Ted","Dude, is everything OK? You left the front door open.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1637","Marshall","There was no time.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1638","Robin","So Love Solutions, did you meet the love of your life?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1639","Ted","She said it'd take three days. It's been five days. Should I be worried?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1640","Lily","Oh, just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1641","Ted","Did you just use my name as a verb?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1642","Barney","Oh, yeah, we do that behind your back. Ted-out  to overthink. Also see Ted-up. Ted-up  to overthink something with disastrous results. Sample sentence  Billy Tedded up when","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1643","Ted","OK, I get it. Don't worry, I'm not gonna ted anything up or out. I'll just give it a few more days.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1644","Ted","Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1645","Ellen","Ted, hi. I meant to call you. The computer is still crunching the numbers. Busy as a bee, that little computer.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1646","Ted","You said it was gonna be three days.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1647","Ellen","Did I?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1648","Ted","Hm.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1649","Ellen","Three days? Really?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1650","Ted","Yeah. When someone says you're gonna meet the perfect woman in three days, you gotta put that in your datebook, so...","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1651","Ellen","How do I say this? This is gonna be really hard. Ted, there are absolutely no women out there for you. Phew, actually I got through that OK.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1652","Ted","There are no women for me out there? I thought you said there were 8.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1653","Ellen","I know. There are supposed to be. I don't know where they are.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1654","Ted","But, I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute. I'm a cute architect.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1655","Ellen","How do you think I feel? I have a 100% success rate. It's my hook. I could probably find somebody for you if you were gay.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1656","Ted","Well, I'm not.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1657","Ellen","A little bi maybe?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1658","Ted","No. You're messing with me, right?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1659","Ellen","Come see for yourself.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1660","Ellen","I cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 or higher, and look, 5.4, 4.8, 5.6...","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1661","Ted","There's a 9.6 right there.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1662","Ellen","Don't touch the computer. Yes, Sarah O'Brien. I fixed her up six months ago. She would have been absolutely perfect for you.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1663","Ted","What about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1664","Ellen","8.5.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1665","Ted","So he sucks.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1666","Ellen","No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1667","Ted","Oh, sure, it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1668","Ellen","Yes, 9.6 is off the charts, but Sarah is matched up. Ted, look, I have a lunch. Please. I promise we will find you somebody. Don't lose hope. There are new women turning 18 every day.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1669","Lily","He's a whole new species. The cockamouse.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1670","Marshall","And it's the size of a potato.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1671","Robin","So, what, now it's a cockapotatomouse?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1672","Marshall","Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cockamouse.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1673","Ted","My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1674","Barney","Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1675","Marshall","And like the majestic seahorse it's hermaphroditic.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1676","Lily","Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1677","Marshall","For as much as we know about the cockamousse, there are still so much we don't know.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1678","Robin","Well, we know that there's no such thing as a cockamouse. What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1679","Marshall","So you really don't believe in the cockamouse?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1680","Robin","Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know, um, like the Loch Ness Monster.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1681","Marshall","If by 'like the Loch Ness Monster,' you mean, totally exists and is awesome, then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1682","Marshall","It's diet is not unlike our own, grains, cereals and it's awfully fond of cheese...","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1683","Ted","OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1684","Barney","You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1685","Ted","All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1686","Future Ted VO","That's right, I did the math.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1687","Ted","Hi.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1688","Sarah","Hi, I'm Dr. O'Brien.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1689","Ted","I'm Architect Mosby. Sorry I just wanted to say my job too.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1690","Ted","Hi, I'm Ted.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1691","Sarah","So, what are we doing today?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1692","Ted","I have a kind of mole on my back. It's probably nothing but I'm a cautious guy.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1693","Sarah","I'm exactly the same.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1694","Ted (singing)","Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1695","Sarah (joining in singing)","Blowing through the jasmine in my mind.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1696","Ted","Sorry about that, Summer Breeze is my guilty pleasure song.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1697","Ted","Oh, it's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend at brunch.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1698","Sarah","I love brunch.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1699","Ted","It's the best, as long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1700","Sarah","I like the way you think, Architect Mosby.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1701","Ted","Hey, this may sound weird but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off so I'm gonna ask you now. Do you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1702","Sarah","Oh, that's very sweet, but I'm actually getting married on Saturday.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1703","Ted","Friday night?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1704","Ted","Wow, you're getting married. Congratulations.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1705","Sarah","Thank you.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1706","Ted","I'm really sorry I asked you out. If just felt like there might be this weird connection between us. How crazy am I coming off here?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1707","Sarah","Only a little.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1708","Ted","Well, by some million to one shot, and I'm not rooting for this, you wind up not getting married this weekend, give me a call.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1709","Sarah","OK, but it's not likely. I look damn good in my dress.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1710","Ted","I'm sure you do.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1711","Robin","Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap. You think the road runner's gonna fall for it?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1712","Lily","OK, we get it. You're skeptical. But Marshall and I, we're believers. We believe.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1713","Marshall","Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome. You got the Bermuda triangle, ghosts, Big Foot.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1714","Robin","Bad maps. Creaky houses. Hillbilly in a gorilla suit.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1715","Marshall","Aliens.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1716","Marshall","Oh, come one, you gotta give me aliens. Stonehenge. Area 51. There's alien crap all over the place.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1717","Robin","You can't be serious.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1718","Marshall","My friend, you just poked the bear.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1719","Ted","So, my 9.6, beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1720","Robin","Oh.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1721","Lily","Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1722","Ted","Yeah, it was a long shot. I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mine, but I don't know...","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1723","Lily","Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1724","Barney","Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1725","Marshall","On the night of July 2nd, 1947, conditions were clear over Roswell, New Mexico.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1726","Robin","Oh geez.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1727","Marshall","Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you. Dr. O'Brien.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1728","Ted","What?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1729","Marshall","When suddenly, an array of","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1730","Sarah (on answering machine)","Ted, hi, this is Dr. O'Brien. About today, listen, I really need to talk to you. Call me, I'll be at the office all day.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1731","Barney","The doctor will see you now.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1732","Ted","What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1733","Lily","Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1734","Ted","Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1735","Barney","(chuckles) Happy ending.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1736","Ted","Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a shot.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1737","Barney","All right, see you later. Happy hunting.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1738","Lily","Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1739","Barney","Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1740","Marshall","Oh my God!","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1741","Lily","Holy crap. We got it! What do we do with it?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1742","Marshall","Calm down, I have a plan. I told my friend, Sudeep, about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department. But it has to be alive.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1743","Lily","Wait, no no. They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean. Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1744","Ted","Hello again.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1745","Sarah","I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1746","Ted","Go ahead, Sarah, you can tell me anything.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1747","Sarah","You have a basal cell carcinoma.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1748","Ted","Anything else?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1749","Sarah","Your mole. The biopsy came back. It's not life-threatening, but we should excise the rest of it.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1750","Ted","Wait, then you're still getting married.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1751","Sarah","Of course I'm still getting married.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1752","Ted","But we're a 9.6.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1753","Sarah","Excuse me.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1754","Ted","OK, I, I went to Love Solutions and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer that you and I are a 9.6. Your fiance's only an 8.5.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1755","Sarah","You looked at my file.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1756","Ted","I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious? The woman who set you up with your fiancé thinks we're a better match.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1757","Sarah","I am getting married on Saturday.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1758","Ted (singing)","Summer breeze...","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1759","Sarah","Ted.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1760","Ted","Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1761","Sarah","Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you to proposition an engaged woman you don't even know?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1762","Ted","See, we're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1763","Sarah","Ted, just calm down.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1764","Ted","Calm down! You're my only match! There was a computer and there were 8 fish in the sea full of lesbians.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1765","Sarah","Ted, Ted, do you honestly believe deep down that there is no one else out there for you just because some computer says so.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1766","Ted","Didn't used to. There was math, I got confused.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1767","Sarah","Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling. When you fall in love with someone, 8.5 equals a perfect 10.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1768","Ted","You're right.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1769","Sudeep","If this thing is what you say it is, it could be huge for my career.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1770","Marshall","Brace yourself, dude. This is gonna blow your mind hold.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1771","Sudeep","You b*st*rd, I actually got excited about this.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1772","Marshall","What?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1773","Sudeep","It's empty.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1774","Marshall","Wait, but if it's not here, that means...Lily.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1775","Lily","Robin.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1776","Robin","What?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1777","Robin","Oh my God. It's real.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1778","Lily","Oh, is it? Do something.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1779","Lily","What the hell was that? You trying to get it drunk?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1780","Robin","It was the only think I could think of.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1781","Marshall","Lily thank God.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1782","Marshall","Lily, I love you.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1783","Marshall","Robin, open the window!","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1784","Robin","It can fly.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1785","Lily, Marshall","Wow.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1786","Marshall","Be free, mutant beast. I'll miss this private war of ours. I grew to admire your tenacious...Oh my God, it's headed this way.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1787","Ted","Hi Ellen. I think I want my money back.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1788","Ellen","I'm a failure. I'm all washed up. I tried everything, Ted. I widened the search parameters. I tweaked the program. Last night, I stood out on the street for five hours showing your photo to random pedestrians, no takers. Although this transvestite hooker said he/she would do you for half price because you kinda look like John Cusack and his/her favorite movie was Say Anything.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1789","Ted","Come on, Ellen, I mean, a pint of ice cream isn't that a bit cliché?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1790","Ellen","It's for the bourbon.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1791","Ted","This isn't hopeless. You're gonna find someone for me.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1792","Ellen","No, I won't. You're gonna die alone.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1793","Ted","I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive. You just have to get back out there and keep looking.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1794","Ellen","No, you're never gonna find anybody. And every year, you're just getting older and it's getting harder and harder.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1795","Ted","You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be up on that wall one of these days.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1796","Ellen","No you won't.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1797","Ted","Yes I will","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1798","Ellen","How do you know? Ted  I don't know, but I believe. Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse can find love in this crazy city, then, dammit, so can I.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1799","Ellen","You're losing me.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1800","Ted","Point is, something good is going to happen to me. Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1801","Ellen","So I should keep looking?","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1802","Ted","Of course you should. And now you're gonna do it for free.","01","07","Matchmaker"
"1803","Future Ted","So kids, there are many buildings New York City.","01","08","The Duel"
"1804","Future Ted","Thousands of apartments. Millions of stories. And even though it's been decades and someone else lives there now, there's one apartment in particular that will always be our apartment. I have so many great memories of that place.","01","08","The Duel"
"1805","Future Ted VO","Marshall playing video games.","01","08","The Duel"
"1806","Future Ted VO","Lily painting on the fire escape.","01","08","The Duel"
"1807","Mr. Madsen","Hey!","01","08","The Duel"
"1808","Lily","Sorry, Mr. Madsen.","01","08","The Duel"
"1809","Future Ted VO","And me making the coffee. I had this coffeepot that was probably 50 years old at that time, and it made truly terrible coffee. We called it Shocky","01","08","The Duel"
"1810","Ted","Plugging in.","01","08","The Duel"
"1811","Marshall","Saving game.","01","08","The Duel"
"1812","Future Ted VO","I loved every last detail of that place. Right down to the incredibly tacky swords we hung on the wall. I never wanted any of it to change. But that's not how life works.","01","08","The Duel"
"1813","Lily","You guys will never believe what just happened to us.","01","08","The Duel"
"1814","Robin","I don't even believe it myself.","01","08","The Duel"
"1815","Lily","We were in Queens and we decided to stop by my apartment.","01","08","The Duel"
"1816","Daughter","Wait, her apartment? I thought Aunt Lily lived with you and Uncle Marshall.","01","08","The Duel"
"1817","Lily","I could see how you would think that but I have to have my own place. It's an independence thing.","01","08","The Duel"
"1818","Robin","When was the last time you were there?","01","08","The Duel"
"1819","Lily","Three months ago.","01","08","The Duel"
"1820","Lily","What? It's like fat pants. You hope you never have to use 'em but you're glad to know they're there.","01","08","The Duel"
"1821","Lily","What the hell?","01","08","The Duel"
"1822","Robin","What?","01","08","The Duel"
"1823","Lily","This is my apartment.","01","08","The Duel"
"1824","Robin","Where?","01","08","The Duel"
"1825","Lily","Right here.","01","08","The Duel"
"1826","Lily","What the hell?","01","08","The Duel"
"1827","Robin","Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant.","01","08","The Duel"
"1828","Lily","No, no, this was my apartment. My dresser was right...","01","08","The Duel"
"1829","Lily","That's my dresser! And this is my closet.","01","08","The Duel"
"1830","Waitress","Hi, how many?","01","08","The Duel"
"1831","Lily","Yes, you know me?","01","08","The Duel"
"1832","Waitress","Yeah, from your homecoming picture. You're much prettier in person.","01","08","The Duel"
"1833","Lily","Yeah, I know, the bangs were a mistake. Where's my stuff? Waitress  It's all in the back. We could wrap it up for you. You want it to go?","01","08","The Duel"
"1834","Lily","This is my apartment!","01","08","The Duel"
"1835","Waitress","Not anymore.","01","08","The Duel"
"1836","Ted","No way. You're making this up.","01","08","The Duel"
"1837","Marshall","Yeah, the building would have had to give you some sort of notice.","01","08","The Duel"
"1838","Waitress","They sent you a notice about this.","01","08","The Duel"
"1839","Lily","When?","01","08","The Duel"
"1840","Waitress","Three months ago. Here's your mail minus the magazines.","01","08","The Duel"
"1841","Marshall","Well, still, legally, they can't just toss you out onto the street. You have a lease.","01","08","The Duel"
"1842","Lily","OK so I didn't have a written lease as such but, but go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy.","01","08","The Duel"
"1843","Lily","She may be 98 years old but she's still...","01","08","The Duel"
"1844","Lily","She's dead, isn't she?","01","08","The Duel"
"1845","Waitress","Never even saw the bus.","01","08","The Duel"
"1846","Lily","My apartment is a Chinese restaurant. What am I gonna do?","01","08","The Duel"
"1847","Ted","Come live with us.","01","08","The Duel"
"1848","Lily","Really?","01","08","The Duel"
"1849","Ted","Of course.","01","08","The Duel"
"1850","Marshall","You sure about this, Ted?","01","08","The Duel"
"1851","Ted","Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything.","01","08","The Duel"
"1852","Barney","No, it's like it'll change everything. Oh, Ted, you are so screwed.","01","08","The Duel"
"1853","Ted","What? What are you talking about?","01","08","The Duel"
"1854","Robin","And why is that girl checking you out?","01","08","The Duel"
"1855","Barney","Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged","01","08","The Duel"
"1856","Ted","Yeah, so?","01","08","The Duel"
"1857","Barney","So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be?","01","08","The Duel"
"1858","Robin","Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right?","01","08","The Duel"
"1859","Ted","Yeah, we've talked about it.","01","08","The Duel"
"1860","Marshall","So, when Lily and I get married, who's gonna get the apartment?","01","08","The Duel"
"1861","Ted","Oh, that's a tough one. You know who I think could handle a problem like that?","01","08","The Duel"
"1862","Marshall","Who?","01","08","The Duel"
"1863","Ted","Future Ted and Future Marshall.","01","08","The Duel"
"1864","Marshall","Totally. Let's let those guys handle it.","01","08","The Duel"
"1865","Ted","Dammit Past Ted","01","08","The Duel"
"1866","Barney","You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out.","01","08","The Duel"
"1867","Ted","That's crazy. They're not edging me out. Marshall's my best friend.","01","08","The Duel"
"1868","Ted","One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.","01","08","The Duel"
"1869","Barney","Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment.","01","08","The Duel"
"1870","Robin","Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?","01","08","The Duel"
"1871","Barney","Sort of on a date with her.","01","08","The Duel"
"1872","Ted","What?","01","08","The Duel"
"1873","Barney","I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile. (evil laugh) But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.","01","08","The Duel"
"1874","Ted","All right.","01","08","The Duel"
"1875","Robin","You're going to the hospital?","01","08","The Duel"
"1876","Ted","No, see, he's gonna go back over there and I'm gonna call him and he's gonna pretend that it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.","01","08","The Duel"
"1877","Robin","Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney.","01","08","The Duel"
"1878","Barney","Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck.","01","08","The Duel"
"1879","Robin","So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?","01","08","The Duel"
"1880","Ted","He's gonna want the apartment. I'm gonna want the apartment. It's gonna lead to an argument, so no.","01","08","The Duel"
"1881","Robin","Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it.","01","08","The Duel"
"1882","Ted","I should really make this call.","01","08","The Duel"
"1883","Robin","Ooh, can I do it?","01","08","The Duel"
"1884","Barney","Hello? Robin  Hi there, sexy.","01","08","The Duel"
"1885","Barney","Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?","01","08","The Duel"
"1886","Robin","Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff.","01","08","The Duel"
"1887","Barney","An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin  Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy.","01","08","The Duel"
"1888","Barney","Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?","01","08","The Duel"
"1889","Robin","Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.","01","08","The Duel"
"1890","Barney","Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there.","01","08","The Duel"
"1891","Barney","See you guys later.","01","08","The Duel"
"1892","Ted","Ah, this'll be nice, the three of us living together. I think it's a good setup.","01","08","The Duel"
"1893","Ted","Man, this coffee's great. It's really great. Too great.","01","08","The Duel"
"1894","Ted","What happened to Shocky?","01","08","The Duel"
"1895","Ted","What's this? Lily  My coffeemaker from my apartment. Makes great coffee, right?","01","08","The Duel"
"1896","Ted","Yeah, definitely. I mean, so does Shocky.","01","08","The Duel"
"1897","Marshall","Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kinda rusty.","01","08","The Duel"
"1898","Ted","Yeah, no, it did. I mean, I kinda liked the rusty taste. I'm used to it. I don't know.","01","08","The Duel"
"1899","Marshall","Also Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock you.","01","08","The Duel"
"1900","Ted","No. You gotta admit, that shock, wakes you up in the morning","01","08","The Duel"
"1901","Marshall","You know what else wakes you up in the morning? Coffee.","01","08","The Duel"
"1902","Ted","That's great. You're right. Roomies! I love it.","01","08","The Duel"
"1903","Ted","They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.","01","08","The Duel"
"1904","Barney","Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.","01","08","The Duel"
"1905","Robin","Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she!","01","08","The Duel"
"1906","Ted","It's not just the coffeemaker.","01","08","The Duel"
"1907","Lily","Done. The painting's done.","01","08","The Duel"
"1908","Marshall","That is great.","01","08","The Duel"
"1909","Ted","Nice.","01","08","The Duel"
"1910","Marshall","Where do you wanna hang it?","01","08","The Duel"
"1911","Lily","I don't know. Um, over the piano?","01","08","The Duel"
"1912","Ted","Yeah, that would be a good place for it. Too bad the swords are there. We kinda love those swords.","01","08","The Duel"
"1913","Marshall","Well, those swords have been up there a long time.","01","08","The Duel"
"1914","Ted","I know, right? I'd really miss them too. So, maybe Marshall's room?","01","08","The Duel"
"1915","Lily","OK.","01","08","The Duel"
"1916","Ted","He was gonna take the swords down. Can you believe that?","01","08","The Duel"
"1917","Robin","Ted, why don't you just talk to him? He's your best friend.","01","08","The Duel"
"1918","Robin","One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.","01","08","The Duel"
"1919","Barney","Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike.","01","08","The Duel"
"1920","Ted","Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?","01","08","The Duel"
"1921","Barney","You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big.","01","08","The Duel"
"1922","Ted","What, like buy a new sofa?","01","08","The Duel"
"1923","Barney","Bigger.","01","08","The Duel"
"1924","Barney","Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law.","01","08","The Duel"
"1925","Robin","A lemon law, like for cars.","01","08","The Duel"
"1926","Barney","Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now.","01","08","The Duel"
"1927","Barney","Hi Katie. Barney.","01","08","The Duel"
"1928","Katie","Hi, it's good to finally meet you.","01","08","The Duel"
"1929","Barney","Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.","01","08","The Duel"
"1930","Barney (yelling to Katie as she leaves)","Tell your friends.","01","08","The Duel"
"1931","Barney (to Robin and Ted at other table)","It's gonna be a thing.","01","08","The Duel"
"1932","Lily","Man, Ted's been acting weird. He started labeling all his food. He even carved ""Ted"" into that block of cheese.","01","08","The Duel"
"1933","Marshall","Yeah. Well, now it's Ed's.","01","08","The Duel"
"1934","Lily","He's not cool with me moving in.","01","08","The Duel"
"1935","Marshall","No, that's not it. I mean, you basically lived here all along. Ted loves you.","01","08","The Duel"
"1936","Lily","So, what's he PMS'ing about?","01","08","The Duel"
"1937","Marshall","I don't know. But when he's ready to talk to me about it he'll come and talk to me about it.","01","08","The Duel"
"1938","Lily","Are you kidding? You guys never talk about anything.","01","08","The Duel"
"1939","Lily","He'll just let it fester under the surface until he does something big and passive-aggressive.","01","08","The Duel"
"1940","Marshall","You clearly don't know Ted.","01","08","The Duel"
"1941","Delivery guy","Delivery for Ted Mosby.","01","08","The Duel"
"1942","Marshall","Your English phone booth arrived.","01","08","The Duel"
"1943","Ted","Oh, awesome. It's great, right?","01","08","The Duel"
"1944","Marshall","Yeah, I guess. Just not sure if Lily's gonna like it.","01","08","The Duel"
"1945","Ted","Well, I like it, so I'm just gonna keep it right here, if that's cool.","01","08","The Duel"
"1946","Marshall","Of course, we all live here so we should all be able to have things the way we want them.","01","08","The Duel"
"1947","Ted","Exactly.","01","08","The Duel"
"1948","Marshall","Great","01","08","The Duel"
"1949","Marshall","Terrific.","01","08","The Duel"
"1950","Marshall","You like the phone booth. It stays. I like this painting so I'm just gonna hang it...right here on the wall.","01","08","The Duel"
"1951","Ted","Oh, so it's like that, is it?","01","08","The Duel"
"1952","Marshall","Bring, bring.","01","08","The Duel"
"1953","Marshall (in British accent)","Oh hello governor, oh it's like isn't it? Cheerio.","01","08","The Duel"
"1954","Marshall","Yeah, it's like that.","01","08","The Duel"
"1955","Ted","I want this apartment.","01","08","The Duel"
"1956","Marshall","Well, I want it too.","01","08","The Duel"
"1957","Girl #2","You're a jerk.","01","08","The Duel"
"1958","Barney","No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing!","01","08","The Duel"
"1959","Robin","For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society.","01","08","The Duel"
"1960","Barney","No, wrong, lemon law is awesome.","01","08","The Duel"
"1961","Robin","It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great.","01","08","The Duel"
"1962","Barney","OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy.","01","08","The Duel"
"1963","Barney","You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?","01","08","The Duel"
"1964","Robin","Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate.","01","08","The Duel"
"1965","Barney","Bad move, Scherbatsky.","01","08","The Duel"
"1966","Barney","Hi, have you met Robin?","01","08","The Duel"
"1967","Kevin","Hi.","01","08","The Duel"
"1968","Robin","Hi.","01","08","The Duel"
"1969","Ted","All right Marshall, we're deciding right now who gets this apartment. It may lead to an argument, but we're settling this.","01","08","The Duel"
"1970","Marshall","Or we could flip a coin.","01","08","The Duel"
"1971","Ted","Yeah, let's flip a coin.","01","08","The Duel"
"1972","Marshall","Flip it.","01","08","The Duel"
"1973","Ted","OK, I'm flipping it, here I go.","01","08","The Duel"
"1974","Marshall","Flip it.","01","08","The Duel"
"1975","Ted","OK, here I go.","01","08","The Duel"
"1976","Marshall","Flip it.","01","08","The Duel"
"1977","Ted","I'm flipping. But before I do, I just wanna say something. You didn't even wanna move in here in the first place. You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies.","01","08","The Duel"
"1978","Marshall","That was five years ago. Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter. Oh snap. What else you got?","01","08","The Duel"
"1979","Ted","OK, I'm flipping. Heads or tails.","01","08","The Duel"
"1980","Marshall","You don't need two rooms","01","08","The Duel"
"1981","Ted","Heads or tails, Marshall. Like you need two rooms?","01","08","The Duel"
"1982","Marshall","We might be starting a family soon.","01","08","The Duel"
"1983","Ted","Oh, no you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're in law school. It's gonna be at least three years.","01","08","The Duel"
"1984","Marshall","It could be sooner, we're not that careful with our birth control Two-zip.","01","08","The Duel"
"1985","Ted","Oh, come on, you know damn well I move out that room's going unused.","01","08","The Duel"
"1986","Marshall","Oh, and I suppose you'll get a new roommate? Who's it gonna be? Barney? You know he cooks naked.","01","08","The Duel"
"1987","Ted","Yeah, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the swords down.","01","08","The Duel"
"1988","Ted","We were bros! These swords represent our bro-hood. And you took 'em down to make room for your fiance's stupid painting?","01","08","The Duel"
"1989","Marshall","My fiancé...suddenly, she's my fiancé.","01","08","The Duel"
"1990","Ted","I deserve this apartment, Marshall.","01","08","The Duel"
"1991","Marshall","No more than I do.","01","08","The Duel"
"1992","Ted","Great, so let's flip for it.","01","08","The Duel"
"1993","Marshall","Flip it.","01","08","The Duel"
"1994","Ted","So, is this how we're deciding who gets the apartment?","01","08","The Duel"
"1995","Marshall","I guess so.","01","08","The Duel"
"1996","Ted","How are we doing this exactly? Is this like to the death?","01","08","The Duel"
"1997","Marshall","We should probably figure that out.","01","08","The Duel"
"1998","Ted","It's OK, it's OK.","01","08","The Duel"
"1999","Ted","Can I observe something?","01","08","The Duel"
"2000","Marshall","That this is kinda awesome?","01","08","The Duel"
"2001","Ted","Totally.","01","08","The Duel"
"2002","Marshall","I can't believe we didn't do this before.","01","08","The Duel"
"2003","Ted","I know!","01","08","The Duel"
"2004","Robin","Thank you.","01","08","The Duel"
"2005","Kevin","I can't believe this. I'm sitting here with a beautiful woman I just met eating at my favorite restaurant. Sweet.","01","08","The Duel"
"2006","Robin","It's a nice place. It's good to know the future has ribs.","01","08","The Duel"
"2007","Kevin","In the future food will most likely be served in gel-cap form. Plus cows will probably have died out by then... or be our leaders.","01","08","The Duel"
"2008","Robin","Just a second.","01","08","The Duel"
"2009","Robin","Hello.","01","08","The Duel"
"2010","Barney","(laughs) Time's running out, Scherbatsky. Last chance for the lemon law.","01","08","The Duel"
"2011","Robin","Leave me alone.","01","08","The Duel"
"2012","Barney","4 56, 4 57, 4 58.","01","08","The Duel"
"2013","Robin","We're only just getting to know each other.","01","08","The Duel"
"2014","Barney","Say I'm right and this could all be over. This could be your call from the hospital.","01","08","The Duel"
"2015","Robin","Sorry.","01","08","The Duel"
"2016","Kevin","Let me guess, there's been a crazy accident and you have to go.","01","08","The Duel"
"2017","Robin","No, I would never do that. I don't wanna go anywhere. I'm all yours.","01","08","The Duel"
"2018","Kevin","Look, if you're a hooker, I don't have a lot of money.","01","08","The Duel"
"2019","Marshall","That was awesome.","01","08","The Duel"
"2020","Ted","I know.","01","08","The Duel"
"2021","Marshall","Do it again.","01","08","The Duel"
"2022","Ted","OK, but this time, jump up and I'll swipe your legs.","01","08","The Duel"
"2023","Ted","Look. Here's why I should get the place. You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates. And on top of that I could be homeless. Does that seem fair?","01","08","The Duel"
"2024","Marshall","Oh, boo-freakin-hoo.","01","08","The Duel"
"2025","Ted","What?","01","08","The Duel"
"2026","Marshall","Woe is me. I'm not married yet. My ovaries are shrinking. Ted, if you wanted to be married by now you would be but you're not. And you know why? Because you're irrationally picky. You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.","01","08","The Duel"
"2027","Ted","Anhedonic?","01","08","The Duel"
"2028","Marshall","Anhedonic. It means you can't enjoy anything.","01","08","The Duel"
"2029","Ted","The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this.","01","08","The Duel"
"2030","Marshall","I know, this rules.","01","08","The Duel"
"2031","Marshall","Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down.","01","08","The Duel"
"2032","Ted","That's OK, it led to this totally rad sword fight, didn't it?","01","08","The Duel"
"2033","Marshall","Yeah it did.","01","08","The Duel"
"2034","Marshall","You remember when we first got these swords?","01","08","The Duel"
"2035","Ted","It was the day we moved in.","01","08","The Duel"
"2036","Ted","Congratulations, Marshall. We live in an apartment with swords on the wall.","01","08","The Duel"
"2037","Marshall","List of lifelong dreams, you're not half as long. Crap. I'm missing one of the screws for this table","01","08","The Duel"
"2038","Ted","Just use this wood glue, it'll hold.","01","08","The Duel"
"2039","Marshall","Yeah.","01","08","The Duel"
"2040","Robin","Oh God, I'll be right there.","01","08","The Duel"
"2041","Robin","Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go. My friend's been stabbed with a sword.","01","08","The Duel"
"2042","Kevin","Hab slosi quch! You have no honor. You know, if you felt this way you could have just been upfront.","01","08","The Duel"
"2043","Robin","No, I swear that was a real call. I just...Oh forget it.","01","08","The Duel"
"2044","Marshall","I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fiancé.","01","08","The Duel"
"2045","Ted","Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fiancé? I'm kidding. Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment. Marshall  But you fought so bravely for it.","01","08","The Duel"
"2046","Ted","I wasn't fighting for the apartment. I was fighting for...I don't know...for everything to stay the way it is. But I'm not gonna get that, so, seriously, take the place, it's yours.","01","08","The Duel"
"2047","Robin","Is she OK?","01","08","The Duel"
"2048","Marshall","They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine.","01","08","The Duel"
"2049","Barney","So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie.","01","08","The Duel"
"2050","Barney","What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie.","01","08","The Duel"
"2051","Barney","Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O.","01","08","The Duel"
"2052","Jackie","Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to lemon law you.","01","08","The Duel"
"2053","Barney","It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law.","01","08","The Duel"
"2054","Robin","But you're totally...","01","08","The Duel"
"2055","Ted","Just let him have this one.","01","08","The Duel"
"2056","Doctor","All set. She said she'd like to see the knights of the poorly constructed round table?","01","08","The Duel"
"2057","Marshall","That's us.","01","08","The Duel"
"2058","Lily","A sword fight?","01","08","The Duel"
"2059","Marshall, Ted","Sorry, Lily.","01","08","The Duel"
"2060","Lily","On Monday, I'm gonna have to tell my kindergarten class who I teach not to run with scissors that my fiancé ran me through with a frickin' broad sword.","01","08","The Duel"
"2061","Marshall","Well, just to be fair, it didn't go all the way through.","01","08","The Duel"
"2062","Lily","I'm sorry, is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me?","01","08","The Duel"
"2063","Marshall","You're right. I'm sorry. We were fighting to see who gets the apartment. And I won.","01","08","The Duel"
"2064","Ted","Uh, you didn't win. I gave it to you.","01","08","The Duel"
"2065","Marshall","Uh, you know, if I tried...","01","08","The Duel"
"2066","Lily","Wait wait wait wait wait. I don't want that apartment. It's a boy apartment. It's full of swords and videogames, and kinda smells like dude. It's fine for now, but when we get married, I wanna start a new life with you in a new place.","01","08","The Duel"
"2067","Marshall","Gonna miss the old place.","01","08","The Duel"
"2068","Lily","I will too. We're not getting married for like a year.","01","08","The Duel"
"2069","Ted","Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem. Let that guy deal with it.","01","08","The Duel"
"2070","Marshall","Totally.","01","08","The Duel"
"2071","Lily","Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking but I'm starving.","01","08","The Duel"
"2072","Marshall","Let's go get some dinner.","01","08","The Duel"
"2073","Lily","I know just the place.","01","08","The Duel"
"2074","Ted","Chinese restaurant, I still don't believe it.","01","08","The Duel"
"2075","Lily","I told you. OK, a toast.","01","08","The Duel"
"2076","Lily","Life is full of changes. One day you have an apartment, the next day it's a house of dumplings. But the important stuff doesn't change. To the important stuff.","01","08","The Duel"
"2077","Everyone","Here here. Cheers","01","08","The Duel"
"2078","Barney","And to the lemon law.","01","08","The Duel"
"2079","Barney","Self-clink.","01","08","The Duel"
"2080","Lily","And by the way, I bought these glasses. I bought them at Ikea. These are my glasses.","01","08","The Duel"
"2081","Marshall","I love this song. I haven't heard this in forever.","01","08","The Duel"
"2082","Lily","I'm pretty sure this is a mixed tape you made me in sophomore year.","01","08","The Duel"
"2083","Robin","Lily, your apartment makes the best Shanghai dumplings.","01","08","The Duel"
"2084","Marshall (on tape)","I love you, Lily. Happy Valentine's Day 1998.","01","08","The Duel"
"2085","Future Ted","Kids, this is a Thanksgiving story.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2086","Future Ted VO","Thanksgiving in New York is a wonderful time. It's a time for giving of yourself, for thinking of your fellow man, a time when the unforgiving city becomes a little kinder.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2087","Lily","Well, I just ralphed.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"

"2089","Ted","Not how much? What.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2090","Barney","The Thankstini. A fun and delicious new novelty drink I invented. Cranberry juice, potato vodka and a bouillon cube. Tastes just like a turkey dinner.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2091","Marshall","It's like Thanksgiving in my mouth.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2092","Ted","You want a good holiday drink, try his Kwanzaapolitan.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"

"2106","Robin","I'm Canadian, remember? We celebrate Thanksgiving in October.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2107","Ted","Oh, right, I forgot you guys are weird. You pronounce the word out, ""oat""","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2108","Robin","You guys are the world's leader in handgun violence, your healthcare system is bankrupt and your country is deeply divided on almost every important issue.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2109","Ted","Your cops are called Mounties.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2110","Robin","So, probably hanging out with Barney then?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2111","Ted","No, Barney's got his own Thanksgiving tradition.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2112","Barney","Thanksgiving in a strip club, who's in? The Lusty Leopard has a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet. Plus, they do this thing. Heather dresses up as a pilgrim and Misty dresses up as an Indian, and they share a meal.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2113","Lily","Oh, Barney.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2114","Barney","I'm sorry, Native American.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"

"2124","Marshall","Hello, we're home!","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2125","Future Ted VO","A very big welcome. You see, at 6'4"", Marshall was the runt of the Ericksen clan.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"

"2131","Lily","You're gonna go play hockey?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2132","Lily","With a basketball?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2133","Mr. Ericksen","Well, it's a combination of the two. We call it baskiceball.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2134","Marshall","We invented it. It's the most dangerous and awesome sport in the world.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2135","Lily","Baskiceball? Not iceketball?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2136","Mr. Ericksen","Iceketball? Just sounds weird.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2137","Ericksens","Yeah.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2138","Marcus","It's baskiceball, OK? And I'm the best.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2139","Marshall","You wish.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2140","Lily","Oh, well maybe that's just 'cause you haven't seen me play.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2141","Marshall","I don't know honey, it's not really a sport for a girl.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2142","Lily","Well, that's funny because your brother throws like a girl.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2143","Mrs. Ericksen","(quietly) Marcus!","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2144","Robin","This is gonna be great.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2145","Ted","I know. I'm so psyched we did this. Look at all these people, giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man. These have got to be the best people in New York.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2146","Barney","Excuse me, guys. Coming through.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2147","Ted","Barney?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"

"2149","Ted","What are you doing here?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2150","Barney","Oh, just the Lord's work.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2151","Ted","But you're Satan.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2152","Barney","Guys, OK, look, I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here. I think it's important to help the less fortunate. I'm the Angelina Jolie of incredibly hot guys.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2153","Robin","This is a joke, right? You don't actually volunteer here.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2154","Kendall","Barney, we need you out front. There is a logjam on the stuffing line. Can you show them how it's done?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2155","Barney","I'm on it.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2156","Ted","Wait, so, this is real. Barney does this?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2157","Kendall","Every Sunday, all year long. He's our best volunteer","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2158","Barney","That's because I was trained by the best, Kendall.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2159","Ted","Anyway, uh, we're psyched to be here, Kendall. What do you need us to do?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2160","Kendall","Go home, we're full.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2161","Robin","What? Ted  We're volunteers, we're unpaid help. Can you really ever have enough unpaid help?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2162","Kendall","On the biggest volunteer day of the year, yeah, you can.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2163","Robin","Come on, we just wanna help out.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2164","Barney","Kendall, they're cool.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2165","Kendall","Fine, but I'm not promising anything. Wait here, we'll let you know if we need you.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2166","Barney","OK, well, I better get out there. There's a lot of food to give out. And a lot of smiles.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2167","Mrs. Ericksen","Oh, I almost forgot. I know it's early but you are a future Mrs. Ericksen.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2168","Lily","Thank you. It'll go great with my...I just love it.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2169","Mrs. Ericksen","OK, Lily, we're putting you on salad duty.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2170","Lily","Oh, I make this great frisee and endive salad with a coriander lime vinaigrette.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2171","Pregnant Mrs. Ericksen","But this is an American holiday.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2172","Mrs. Ericksen","Now that you're going to be a Mrs. Ericksen, I'm going to let you in on a secret recipe. The Ericksen family seven-layer salad.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2173","Lily","Seven-layer salad?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2174","Lily","Six cups of mayonnaise? That can't be right.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2175","Mrs. Ericksen","Oh no, dear, sixteen cups.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2176","Mrs. Ericksen","Mayo's in that cabinet.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2177","Marshall","Oh my God, there is some serious baskiceball going on out there. Dad totally nailed Marcus in the face with a snowball, which is a foul because you only get one snowball per possession, so I nailed him in the shin with my skate and I totally dunked it.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2178","Mr. Ericksen","Yeah, you were sitting pretty until I whacked you with that mallet.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2179","Mr. Ericksen","(to Mrs. Ericksen) Hey Gorgeous!","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2180","Marshall","You having fun? Lily  Yeah, but I kinda miss you. Could you stay in here for a little bit?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2181","Marshall","Yeah, yeah yeah, no problem, it's halftime.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2182","Mr. Ericksen","Oh, halftime's over. Get yours butts out here, come on.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2183","Marvin","And I hope you like the taste of stick, dorko.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2184","Lily","Go.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2185","Marshall","Thanks baby.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2186","Marshall","Oh, isn't this great? Can't you see why everybody from my high school stays in this town?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2187","Marshall","Hey Marvin, you're the dorko, dorko!","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2188","Barney","Man, it's amazing out there. I've done so much good today, I've got like a soul boner.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2189","Robin","Yesterday you said the best feeling on earth was getting your toes sucked. Then you requested a high-five with your foot.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2190","Ted","Hey, Barn? What do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2191","Barney","(laughs) You wanna scoop stuffing your first day out? Hello, NFL, can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2192","Lily","OK, I finished the gummy bear layer of the salad. What's next?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2193","Lily","Potato chips.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2194","Mrs. Ericksen","So, Lily, when are you gonna start thinking about having a baby?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2195","Lily","Baby? Uh, you know, I hadn't really thought about it at all.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2196","Future Ted VO","Actually Aunt Lily was lying. It'd been all she'd been thinking about. You see, remember when she said...","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2197","Lily","Well, I just ralphed.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2198","Future Ted VO","At that point she was five days late. This was day six.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2199","Lily","Yeah, I mean, I'm way too young to have a baby, right?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2200","Mrs. Ericksen","Oh, are you kidding? I was younger than you when I had Marcus. Beautiful 15 pound boy. Not much bigger than this turkey right here.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2201","Lily","(staring at turkey) Oh my.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2202","Future Ted VO","Now if Lily was already uneasy about joining the Ericksen family, imagine how she felt about possibly having a 15-pound Ericksen growing inside of her.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2203","Lily","That's a big baby, Judy.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2204","Mrs. Ericksen","The doctor thought he was twins.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2205","Lily","(laughs nervously) Twins. Twins!","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2206","Ted","This is crazy. When did it get so hard to do charity work?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2207","Robin","I do charity work all the time. Remember when I said I'd find you a girlfriend.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2208","Ted","Ha ha. Delightful. How is that little project coming along anyway?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2209","Robin","I'm working on it. I'm gonna introduce you to that girl you've been staring at.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2210","Ted","What? That's crazy, I haven't been staring at any girl...","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2211","Robin","Have you met Ted?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2212","Ted","Hi, I'm the aforementioned Ted, and this is...","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2213","Ted","... gone.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2214","Amanda","I'm Amanda.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2215","Ted","Hi.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2216","Amanda","So, what do you do here, Ted?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2217","Ted","Well, I've been...nothing. I do nothing.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2218","Amanda","If you want to do something, you and your girlfriend can help sort through these donations.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2219","Robin","Oh, um, I'm not his girlfriend. I used to be but, um, I just wasn't enough woman for Ted, emotionally or sexually. Oh my God.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2220","Ted","So, Amanda, what do you need us to do?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2221","Amanda","OK, this is important. Go through all these boxes of food donations, take out the really good stuff and put it into this box.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2222","Ted","Got it. Consider it sorted.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2223","Robin","Hey, we're in business.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2224","Ted","Hey, Barney's not gonna get all the glory today.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2225","Ted","Let's start with this one.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2226","Robin","Yeah.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2227","Mr. Ericksen","Amen.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2228","Ericksens","Amen.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2229","Pregnant Mrs. Ericksen","Look who came to say good-night. It's little Martin. Three-months old.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2230","Lily","Three months! Three months?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2231","Marshall","He's been drinking his milk.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2232","Ericksens","Here here.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2233","Lily","And she's already pregnant again.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2234","Mr. Ericksen","Well, that's 'cause those Ericksen boy's boys can swim. They've got two tails and a drill bit for a head.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2235","Marshall","Dad, you're embarrassing me.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2236","Mr. Ericksen","Ah, son, she's cool. She's gonna be an Ericksen.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2237","Lily","Yeah, well, well, not literally because, you know, I'm keeping my name.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2238","Mrs. Ericksen","But the apron.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2239","Marshall","Well, we haven't actually decided anything yet so...","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2240","Lily","No, I've decided and I'm keeping my own name.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2241","Mr. Ericksen","But Ericksen is a great last name. People know the Ericksen's.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2242","Lily","Oh, sure, in St. Cloud but our kids aren't gonna be growing up in St. Cloud. Right, baby?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2243","Marshall","Why not St. Cloud? I mean, I loved growing up St. Cloud. St. Cloud is a great place to have a childhood.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2244","Lily","Oh, so is New York.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2245","Lily","What? It is. And we grew up just fine. And we grew to the proper size and then we stopped.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2246","Ted","Hey, Amanda, what's this box for?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2247","Amanda","Oh, that's for me. You can put it in my car.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2248","Ted","In your car, um, then you'll take it...","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2249","Amanda","Home? We get so much extra food, no one can eat it all. Oh, Truffle oil. Score.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2250","Ted","People donated this food thinking it was going to feed the hungry.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2251","Amanda","I know, and I'm starving.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2252","Lily","But, Marshall, you love New York.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2253","Marshall","Yes, I do. But you always said that when we had kids, you wanted to move out of Manhattan.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2254","Lily","Yeah, to Brooklyn.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2255","Marshall","Why are we even talking about this? This is way down the road.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2256","Future Ted VO","But Lily knew way down the road might not be so far down the road.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2257","Lily","I need to go to the restroom.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2258","Marshall","Lily, the restroom's the other way.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2259","Future Ted VO","So she headed down the road.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2260","Marshall","Lily.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2261","Marshall","Lily!","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2262","Barney","So, wait, not only have you not done any good for anyone today, you're actually helping someone steal from the homeless. You know, Ted, it's called Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking. Damn.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2263","Kendall","Barney, you need me to sign your time sheet, right?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2264","Barney","Yeah, Right. Thanks.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2265","Ted","Barney.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2266","Barney","Yeah, what's up?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2267","Ted","You have a time sheet. No one else has a time sheet.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2268","Barney","Yeah, so.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2269","Ted","All right, let me see that.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2270","Barney","That's my private personal business!","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2271","Ted","Court-mandated community service.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2272","Barney","That's my private personal business.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2273","Barney","I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2274","Ted","You peed on a church?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2275","Barney","I peed in an alley which happened to have a church which I did not see because I was drunk.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2276","Ted","Oh, you are evil.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2277","Robin","Now, all's right with the world again.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2278","Barney","OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2279","Barney","When's the last time either of you did any good? Huh?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2280","Ted","Kendall, ah, Kendall, Amanda is stealing Portobello mushrooms from homeless people.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2281","Kendall","Amanda! I called dibs on the Portobello mushrooms.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2282","Ted","Those are for the hungry.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2283","Kendall","I know, and I'm starving.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2284","Amanda","Those are good mushrooms!","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2285","Ted","Mushrooms. Mushrooms. Portobello mushrooms for everybody! Take them and run! They're very expensive!","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2286","Clerk","Happy Thanksgiving.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2287","Lily","Happy Thanksgiving. As in check out the chick buying the knock-up test everybody, wonder what must be going through her head. Yeah, well, since you asked, a family of mayonnaise-guzzling giants is trying to suck me into their suburban nightmare. And there's a solid chance that I have an Ericksen the size of a 15-pound turkey growing inside of me.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2288","Clerk","You know the Ericksen's? Marshall's fiancé.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2289","Lily","Fantastic.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2290","Clerk","So nice to meet you. You are taller than described.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2291","Lily","I'm sorry I just yelled at you. You mind if I use your bathroom?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2292","Clerk","Don't have one.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2293","Lily","So what do you do when you have to...?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2294","Clerk","I hold it.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2295","Ted","You can't fire a volunteer.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2296","Robin","Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2297","Barney","I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2298","Barney","Volunteer of the year!","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2299","Ted","I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just tell me, I'll do it.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2300","Barney","Ted, I'm glad you asked.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2301","Robin","Surprisingly good.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2302","Barney","Right? I told you so.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2303","Ted","Public urination. Who gets arrested for public urination?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2304","Marshall","Lily's been arrested.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2305","Judy","Oh dear, what for? Marshall  Public urination.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2306","Marshall","Thanks, Pete.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2307","Pete","No problemo Marsh.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2308","Marshall","You all right? Lily  No. I embarrassed myself in front of your family and now I'm celebrating Thanksgiving in probably the most depressing place ever.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2309","Marshall","Well, I'm glad that you're safe. Hey, weird question, why did you drive three miles down Route 23 and take a pee behind a convenience store?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2310","Lily","OK, I'll tell you but before I do, promise me that we are not gonna move to St. Cloud, Minnesota, promise.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2311","Marshall","Look, I'm not suggesting that we move here tomorrow. I'm just...","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2312","Lily","Just promise.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2313","Marshall","Why do you want me to promise you that?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2314","Lily","Because I don't fit in here. I'm not eight feet tall and I don't think you can call it a salad if it has Funyuns in it.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2315","Marshall","I'm Funyuns and mayonnaise and gummy bears and baskiceball and I love St. Cloud. And yes, there is a part of me that would like to move here someday, and why are we having this discussion in a jail cell on Thanksgiving?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2316","Pete","OK, personal effects, one wallet, one cell phone, one pregnancy test.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2317","Lily","Pete arrested me before I could look at it.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2318","Marshall","Whoa.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2319","Lily","Yeah.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2320","Marshall","Lily, we can't let our kids play baskiceball. Baskiceball is really dangerous.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2321","Lily","Yeah, what are the rules to that game, anyway? Marshall  There are no rules, we just wail on each other.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2322","Marshall","Look, I don't wanna be exactly like my family, and don't take this the wrong way, but I don't wanna be exactly like your family either.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2323","Lily","Great, now I'm crying. Look, we may have some really big decisions to make in about 10 seconds but right now, I don't care where our kids grow up as long as they have you for a father.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2324","Lily","Gosh, I hope you're the father. Just a little joke to lighten up the mood.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2325","Marshall","What does it say? Lily  I'm afraid to look.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2326","Pete","(yelling from outside cell) It's negative.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2327","Lily","Thank God.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2328","Lily","(to Pete) And hey!","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2329","Robin","Ted. Are you listening? You're a good guy.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2330","Ted","You wanna know why I have to work tomorrow? My firm's designing an executive lounge for a tobacco company. In the fight against cancer, I'm on the side of cancer.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2331","Barney","OK, Ted, I found a way for you to help someone, to do some good. This is Walter, and Walter is homeless. And Walter would like a lap dance.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2332","Ted","Are you joking?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2333","Barney","I never joke about the sublime art of burlesque entertainment.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2334","Ted","No, Barney, that's insane. Sir, would you like me to buy you a ticket to the buffet.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2335","Walter","No, I'm stuffed. Just a lap dance would be fine.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2336","Barney","Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners. You know where he hasn't been? To heaven with Samantha. Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need. Now buy this man a lap dance.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2337","Robin","You said you wanted to see the joy in someone's eyes.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2338","Ted","You know, I don't think I'm gonna watch.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2339","Ted","Here you go, Walter. Happy Thanksgiving.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2340","Walter","Thank you so much. No really, thank you.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2341","Ted","Happy Thanksgiving, guys.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2342","Robin","Thanksgiving in November. Weird.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2343","Future Ted VO","So that was Thanksgiving 2005. To be honest, it didn't go great. But like has plenty of good parts. It's the rough parts that make you thankful that you have people to share it with.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2344","Dancer","Hey, I saw what you did for that guy? It was really sweet. Do you wanna dance?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2345","Ted","Uh, no thanks. You want some yams?","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2346","Dancer","No thanks. I'm Amber.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2347","Ted","I'm Ted.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2348","Dancer","Actually, I'm Tracy.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2349","Ted","Still Ted.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2350","Future Ted VO","And that, kids, is the true story of how I met your mother.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2351","Daughter, Son","What?!","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2352","Future Ted","I'm kidding.","01","09","Belly Full of Turkey"
"2353","Future Ted VO","Now I remember a lot of stories from back in the days before I met your mother, but there's one story I don't remember. Uncle Marshall still refers to it as the pineapple incident.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2354","Carl","On the house.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2355","Everyone","Whoa.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2356","Carl","It's my own concoction. I call it the Red Dragon.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2357","Everyone","Wow. Thanks, Carl.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2358","Ted","We're not really doing shots, are we?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2359","Lily","I hope not.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2360","Barney","No, no.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2361","Lily","These look kinda like blood.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2362","Marshall","OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2363","Barney","That's ridiculous.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2364","Marshall","I'm serious. Think about it. He always wears black, we never see him in the daylight, only after dark.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2365","Robin","Oh my God, that does describe a vampire, or you know, a bartender.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2366","Robin","Well, I should go get dressed.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2367","Ted","Where are you going, buddy? Hot date?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2368","Lily","I'll say, she's going out with a billionaire.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2369","Robin","Lily, I told you not to call him that.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2370","Ted","Wait, you're really going out with a billionaire?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2371","Robin","He's not a billionaire. He's a hundred millionaire. Why do people always round up?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2372","Ted","So, uh, where's Thurston Howell taking you?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2373","Robin","A charity dinner.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2374","Lily","Yeah, $2000 a plate.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2375","Robin","$1500, Stop rounding up. And it's for third world hunger.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2376","Barney","You gonna put out?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2377","Barney","What? There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2378","Lily","I think my soul just threw up a little bit.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2379","Robin","Well, I'm gonna be late. You guys have fun. Bye.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2380","Ted","See ya.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2381","Lily","Bye.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2382","Marshall","You OK?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2383","Ted","Sure, why?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2384","Marshall","I don't know. Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2385","Ted","OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for...","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2386","Barney","What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2387","Ted","Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2388","Barney","Daddy's home.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2389","Ted","Daddy's home?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2390","Barney","Yeah.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2391","Ted","You want us to go over there right now and say to those girls, 'daddy's home.' Really think about that, Barney.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2392","Barney","Hm. Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2393","Marshall","OK, think about this, is there even a single item on the menu that has garlic in it?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2394","Lily","Garlic fries.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2395","Marshall","OK, well, I'll get back to you.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2396","Ted","Oh, daddy's back. See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that...","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2397","Barney","(holding up small yellow piece of paper) Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy, huh?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2398","Ted","That worked. I hate the world.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2399","Barney","Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2400","Marshall","Doo-doo.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2401","Barney","Totally.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2402","Ted","So, I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2403","Barney","Oh yes it can.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2404","Marshall","Interesting","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2405","Barney","Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2406","Ted","So, what? You want me to do a shot.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2407","Barney","Oh no. I want you to do five shots.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2408","Marshall","Oooh, more interesting.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2409","Ted","Barney, I think you've officially...","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2410","Barney","No, don't think. Do.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2411","Marshall","Ted, he's right. You overthink. Maybe you should overdrink.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2412","Marshall, Barney","Drink, drink, drink, drink...","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2413","Ted","Ah, Lily, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2414","Lily","Guys, you are being immature and moronic and drink, drink, drink","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2415","Marshall, Lily, Barney","Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink...","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2416","Marshall, Lily, Barney","Yes! Drink, drink, drink...","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2417","Ted","Let me tell you something about this brain, OK?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2418","Marshall, Lily, Barney","Drink! Drink, drink...","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2419","Ted","Even alcohol cannot stop this brain.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2420","Barney","I love it, I love it, I love it.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2421","Marshall, Lily","Drink, drink, drink...","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2422","Ted","This brain, dear mortals, is no ordinary brain.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2423","Marshall, Lily, Barney","Drink, drink, drink, drink...","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2424","Ted","This is a superbrain.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2425","Ted","This brain is unstoppable. This brain...","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2426","Future Ted VO","And that's all I remember, except for a few hazy memories.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2427","Future Ted VO","But really, the next thing I remember is waking up the following morning.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2428","Future Ted VO","So, there were some unanswered questions.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2429","Future Ted VO","How much did I drink? How did I sprain my ankle?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2430","Future Ted VO","And who was this girl in my bed?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2431","Ted","OK, what the hell happened last night?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2432","Marshall","You really don't remember, Superbrain?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2433","Future Ted VO","So, Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily filled me in.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2434","Carl","And how did you guys like the shots?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2435","Ted","I drank all five, bitch.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2436","Marshall","(laughing) I love drunk Ted.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2437","Ted","Marshall thinks you're a vampire.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2438","Carl","If he pukes, one of you guys cleans it up.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2439","Lily","No dibs. (Lily puts index finger on her nose)","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2440","Marshall","Oh. (Marshall puts index finger on his nose)","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2441","Barney","No....Dammit.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2442","Ted","How quickly you all forget. I haven't puked since high school. I am vomit-free since ninety-three. Vomit free since ninety-three. That's funny. I'm funny.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2443","Lily","Who are you calling?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2444","Ted","Robin.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2445","Marshall","Oh, bad idea.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2446","Barney","No, no, that's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk. You do things you would never do in a million years if you were sober.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2447","Lily","Says every girl you've ever slept with.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2448","Marshall","(pointing to Lily) Say what?!","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2449","Ted","Hello Robin, it's Ted.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2450","Robin","Oh hi Ted.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2451","Ted","Hello Robin, it's Ted.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2452","Robin","Hi Ted. Sounds like you're having fun.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2453","Ted","Robin, have I ever told you that I'm vomit-free since ninety-three?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2454","Robin","Listen, Ted, I can't really talk right... '93? Dude, that's impressive.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2455","Ted","I don't say this enough, but you're a great woman, and a great reporter. You should be on 60 Minutes. You should be one of the minutes.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2456","Robin","That's sweet and odd. But I'm kinda on a date right now.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2457","Ted","Yeah, and I disagree with Barney. Just 'cause this guy is spending a lot of money doesn't mean you have to put out. Take it slow, Robin, take it slow. Slow.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2458","Robin","Bye Ted.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2459","Ted","Slow.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2460","Marshall","Wow, right, that's why we don't do shots.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2461","Lily","Friends don't let friends drink and dial.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2462","Ted","I need that phone back.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2463","Lily","You'll get this back at the end of class.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2464","Barney","Ding, class dismissed. Here you go, kid, you call whoever you want.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2465","Ted","Thank you kind sir. At least someone appreciates the fact that I'm doing and not thinking. And now I don't think I won't not go to the bathroom.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2466","Lily","Was that necessary? He is not making smart decisions. Barney  Exactly. It's like, what's he gonna do next. I don't know, but I want to find out.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2467","Marshall","Cheap Trick? Oh Ted.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2468","Robin","Hello again, Ted.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2469","Ted","Hey, it's me again.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2470","Ted","(singing along with jukebox) Plain to see again.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2471","Ted","(singing along with jukebox) Please can I see you every day?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2472","Ted","(yelling to everyone in bar) I love everyone in this bar.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2473","Marshall","And we love you, drunk Ted.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2474","Ted","(singing along with jukebox) I'm a fool again.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2475","Ted","(singing along with jukebox) I fell in love...","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2476","Robin","Ted?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2477","Ted","Well, that explains the ankle.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2478","Lily","And then we brought you home and put you to bed.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2479","Ted","Was there anyone else in there with me?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2480","Lily","There's a girl in there.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2481","Ted","I know.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2482","Marshall","And a pineapple.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2483","Ted","I know.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2484","Lily","Who is she?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2485","Ted","I don't know.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2486","Ted","What the hell happened to my jacket? Marshall  Whoa.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2487","Lily","That girl in there is alive, right? Ted  I should call Barney, maybe he knows what happened.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2488","Barney","Hello.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2489","Ted","Why are you sleeping in our tub?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2490","Barney","The porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2491","Lily","Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2492","Barney","Don't worry, I slept through it. (laughs) I totally didn't sleep through it. For a little girl, you've got a big tank.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2493","Marshall","How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around one.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2494","Barney","Oh, you put Ted to bed all right.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2495","Ted","You guys take care of me. You guys are the best. I love you guys so much.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2496","Lily","Good night, Ted.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2497","Marshall","Love you too, buddy.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2498","Ted","I'm back baby doll!","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2499","Barney","Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2500","Barney","All right, game face on. Carl, two more. All right, all right, what do we think of this one?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2501","Ted","I think....","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2502","Barney","Ehhh! Trick question, no thinking. You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2503","Ted","Bring it.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2504","Barney","Have you met Ted?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2505","Barney","You're calling Robin.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2506","Ted","I'm calling Robin.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2507","Barney","Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2508","Ted","Oh yeah? What you gonna do?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2509","Barney","If you complete that call, I will set your coat on fire.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2510","Ted","You're bluffing.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2511","Ted","Hello, Robin, it's Ted.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2512","Robin","Ted, for the last time, stop.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2513","Robin","Ted!","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2514","Ted","You set me on fire.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2515","Barney","Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast. You got robbed, this is a blend.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2516","Ted","You set me on fire. And who's the girl in my bed?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2517","Marshall","And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2518","Barney","Who is she?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2519","Ted","I have no idea.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2520","Barney","Nice.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2521","Ted","You really don't know who that is?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2522","Barney","No, after I hosed you down with a beverage gun, I brought you back here.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2523","Ted","I better not have gotten burned.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2524","Ted","Did any of you write that?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2525","Lily","(reading what's on Ted's arm) Hi, I'm Ted, if lost, please call...Who's number is that?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2526","Ted","I don't know.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2527","Marshall","Dude, call it. Hold on, I'm gonna make some popcorn.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2528","Marshall","OK, you can call now. God, this is intense, I love it.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2529","Guy","Hello.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2530","Ted","Uh, hi, who is this?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2531","Guy","You called me, who's this?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2532","Ted","It's Ted.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2533","Carl","It's Carl, from the bar.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2534","Future Ted VO","And then Carl filled us in.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2535","Ted","Barney, you've always taken care of me. You are a gentleman and a scholar. Go into my stable and take my finest stallion. He's yours, his name is Windjammer.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2536","Barney","Sleep it off, bra.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2537","Ted","I'm back, baby doll! Ted  And I am gonna throw up.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2538","Ted","I threw up? My streak is over. Vomit-free since '05 doesn't sound good. Sorry, Carl, go on.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2539","Ted","Carl, did you know the word karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra? Isn't that hauntingly beautiful? Are you a vampire? Carl  I am cutting you off. Go home and get some sleep, Ted.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2540","Ted","Yeah, sun's gonna come up soon. Wouldn't want to be around for that, would we?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2541","Ted","Hey, how easy do you think it'll be to sneak into the zoo? I have to see some penguins, like right now.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2542","Carl","Give me your arm.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2543","Carl","This way, if you pass out in the gutter...","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2544","Ted","That tickles.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2545","Carl","Someone will call me and I will come get you.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2546","Ted","Thanks Carl. We can't just be friends, we're attracted to each other and we both know it.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2547","Carl","Excuse me?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2548","Ted","Me and Robin. Me and Robin, I have to make one more call.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2549","Carl","Yeah, this'll go good.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2550","Ted","Hey, it's me again. Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life, so shy don't you come over to my apartment and we'll think of something stupid to do together? Really? Great. Wait, really? Great.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2551","Ted","Thanks Carl.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2552","Ted","It's Robin. That's Robin in there.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2553","Marshall","Did you guys?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2554","Barney","Oh come on. You've gotta give me this one. Those five shots got you farther with Robin than your brain ever did. See what happens when you don't think? You do! More importantly, you do Robin. Come on.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2555","Lily","All right, right over here.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2556","Ted","Still, what does this mean? Are we dating now? I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it...","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2557","Barney","Someone get him a shot, he's thinking again.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2558","Marshall","Maybe it's not such a bad idea to think about this one. You and Robin went down this road before, you got dinged up pretty bad.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2559","Lily","You know who might have something to say about Ted's future with Robin? Robin. Go wake her up.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2560","Ted","Wake her up and say what?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2561","Barney","Daddy's home.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2562","Marshall","Good luck buddy.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2563","Ted","Hello.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2564","Robin","Ted, it's Robin.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2565","Ted","Are you sure?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2566","Ted","Hey, Robin, how are you?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2567","Robin","Ted, I think you and I should have a talk about those phone calls last night. Do you mind if I swing by?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2568","Marshall","Ask her about the pineapple.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2569","Ted","Yeah, sure, come on over.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2570","Robin","Thanks.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2571","Ted","No, wait, don't, no.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2572","Ted","She's coming over. Crap.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2573","Lily","Wait, this is killing me. We have to find out who that girl is.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2574","Trudy","Trudy. My name is Trudy.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2575","Future Ted VO","And then Trudy filled us in.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2576","Trudy's friend","I'm just surprised you didn't dump him sooner.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2577","Trudy","I know, it's two years of my life I'm never getting back. A little part of me just wants to jump the bones of the next guy I see.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2578","Barney","Daddy's home.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2579","Trudy","Or the one after that.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2580","Barney","OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2581","Barney","Ladies.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2582","Ted","I love everyone in this bar.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2583","Trudy's friend","Look at that idiot go.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2584","Trudy","He's kinda cute.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2585","Ted","What are you doing in the men's room? What am I doing in the ladies' room? Oh right, I came in here 'cause I thought I was gonna throw up.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2586","Trudy","Did you?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2587","Ted","I did not.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2588","Ted","And the streak continues. Vomit-free since '93.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2589","Ted","Sorry, Trudy, go on.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2590","Trudy","I liked your performance.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2591","Ted","What? The karaoke? Domo arigato.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2592","Trudy","I wish I had your guts, getting up and making a complete idiot of myself.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2593","Ted","Do it.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2594","Trudy","I don't know. Still, I've had a pretty serious week. I could sure stand to do something stupid.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2595","Ted","I'm something stupid, do me.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2596","Trudy","You're funny.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2597","Ted","Hey, can I call you sometime? Trudy  OK.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2598","Ted","Why do they call it karaoke anyhow? Was it invented by a woman named Carrie Okie? These are the kinds of things I think about. Trudy  Karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2599","Ted","That's hauntingly beautiful.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2600","Ted","Hey, it works.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2601","Trudy","Then I guess you're gonna have to call me.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2602","Ted","I need to make one more call.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2603","Trudy","Hello.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2604","Ted","Hey, it's me again.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2605","Trudy","Hey.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2606","Ted","Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2607","Trudy","So I came over here. And now I'm really, really embarrassed.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2608","Marshall","Dammit, Trudy, what about the pineapple? Sorry.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2609","Ted","Uh, Robin's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2610","Trudy","Why, is that your girlfriend?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2611","Ted","No, that's not my girlfriend. Look, it's complicated.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2612","Trudy","You're married. Yeah, I can't believe I did this.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2613","Ted","No, I'm not married. Um, I'll explain after you hide.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2614","Ted","Hi.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2615","Robin","Hey guys.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2616","Barney","Robin.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2617","Lily","Hi Robin.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2618","Barney","Top of the morning.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2619","Ted","Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was very drunk.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2620","Robin","No kidding. Those calls were really weird. Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2621","Lily","Let's go get a snack.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2622","Marshall","I love to snack.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2623","Barney","I'm good.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2624","Ted","Come on, those calls weren't that weird.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2625","Ted","(recording form phone) Robin! Come hang out! OK, I'm gonna make this sound until you come hang out.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2626","Robin","That goes on for three-and a half minutes.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2627","Ted","Without a breath? That's gotta be some kind of record.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2628","Robin","Ted, you can't do this. Please, we're to be friends and now you're making it all confusing.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2629","Ted","No I'm not. Look, I just turned off my brain for the night. Nothing's changed, you've moved on, I've moved on.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2630","Robin","Really, you moved on?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2631","Ted","Yes. What, you don't believe me?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2632","Ted","Oh, OK.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2633","Ted","Trudy, come on out.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2634","Robin","Wait, you were with someone last night? Ted  Yeah, Trudy, she's cool.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2635","Ted","Trudy, come on out.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2636","Ted","Seriously, it's OK. This is so Trudy. She's really shy, I think.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2637","Ted","Trudy?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2638","Robin","Hi Trudy, I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you. You're right, she is shy.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2639","Ted","I'm not making this up. She must have climbed out the fire escape.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2640","Ted","Whatever, whatever. I don't care what you think.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2641","Robin","Then why did you hide her from me? Ted  Wow, you're good. Did anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 Minutes?","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2642","Robin","Yes, you did, last night.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2643","Ted","Really? Well.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2644","Robin","Get some sleep, Ted. You had a long night. And don't feel bad, I've woken up with worse.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2645","Future Ted VO","I left Trudy a message but she never called me back. That's just how life works sometimes. You turn off your brain for a night, and all you're left with is a bad hangover, a sprained ankle.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2646","Future Ted VO","Oh, and we never found out where that pineapple came from, but it was delicious.","01","10","The Pineapple Incident"
"2647","Ted from 2030","Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks. Sure, it looks great on TV, but in reality, it's always just a big let down, but in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible, to give my friends a great New Year's Eve. I had an idea of how to do it, too. And all it cost was half my Christmas bonus.","01","11","The Limo"
"2648","Ted","Yeah, that's right...a limo.","01","11","The Limo"
"2649","Robin","Oh, man, Ted, this is great.","01","11","The Limo"
"2650","Ted","Okay, people, let's talk strategy. Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked. This year we party together or not at all. Now, I sifted through your party submission and I narrowed them down to these five.","01","11","The Limo"
"2651","Barney","Question?","01","11","The Limo"
"2652","Ted","Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.","01","11","The Limo"
"2653","Barney","But you enjoyed the e-vite, right? Thas an actual picture of my pants.","01","11","The Limo"
"2654","Lily","Yeah.","01","11","The Limo"
"2655","Ted","We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City and that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year.","01","11","The Limo"
"2656","Lily","All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?","01","11","The Limo"
"2657","Robin","Mary Beth?","01","11","The Limo"
"2658","Ted","Oh, she works in my office. She seems like she might be into me. She's always finding reasons to hug me. So tonight...","01","11","The Limo"
"2659","Barney","People often ask me ""Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?""","01","11","The Limo"
"2660","Lily","By who? Who asks you that?","01","11","The Limo"
"2661","Barney","And the answer is right here... my own, personal ""get psyched"" mix. Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong. It should be all rise, baby. Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline. Bam.","01","11","The Limo"
"2662","Lily","It's working.","01","11","The Limo"
"2663","Ted","I am definitely getting psyched.","01","11","The Limo"
"2664","Marshall","Oh, God. I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage. Must do robot.","01","11","The Limo"
"2665","Barney","Let's do this!","01","11","The Limo"
"2666","Ted","Yes! Let's! Oh, driver?","01","11","The Limo"
"2667","Barney","Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now. That's awesome.","01","11","The Limo"
"2668","Ranjit","I've moved up in the world.","01","11","The Limo"
"2669","Robin","How do you guys know each other?","01","11","The Limo"
"2670","Ted","Oh, we rode in his cab one time. It's a long story.","01","11","The Limo"
"2671","Barney","Hey, what are we waiting for? We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.","01","11","The Limo"
"2672","Robin","Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up.","01","11","The Limo"
"2673","Ted from 2030","Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend, Derek. Derek. He was like rich, successful, handsome. I hated that guy.","01","11","The Limo"
"2674","Robin","Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun.","01","11","The Limo"
"2675","Lily","Bye.","01","11","The Limo"
"2676","Ted","See ya next year. Go get 'em.","01","11","The Limo"
"2677","Lily","Well, this kind of sucks.","01","11","The Limo"
"2678","Ted","Okay, nobody get down. We knew this going in. We're a man down. That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder. Ranjit! Party number one.","01","11","The Limo"
"2679","Ranjit","Party number one!","01","11","The Limo"
"2680","Barney","Party number one!","01","11","The Limo"
"2681","Marshall","I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets. If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.","01","11","The Limo"
"2682","Ted","Hey, we've got four more parties to hit. If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.","01","11","The Limo"
"2683","Lily","We didn't really get a chance to meet. I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall.","01","11","The Limo"
"2684","Mary Beth","Hi. Mary Beth. So great to meet you guys.","01","11","The Limo"
"2685","Marshall","My word.","01","11","The Limo"
"2686","Lily","You're, you're friendly.","01","11","The Limo"
"2687","Mary Beth","American party friends of Barney's.","01","11","The Limo"
"2688","Lily","Oh, no.","01","11","The Limo"
"2689","Ted","So, Barney, who's your new friend?","01","11","The Limo"
"2690","Barney","Natalya.","01","11","The Limo"
"2691","Natalya","Oh, friendly.","01","11","The Limo"
"2692","Lily","So, where are you from, Natalya?","01","11","The Limo"
"2693","Barney","She... Who knows? The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?","01","11","The Limo"
"2694","Natalya","Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?","01","11","The Limo"
"2695","Barney","Isn't she awesome?","01","11","The Limo"
"2696","Marshall","How are your feet doing, baby?","01","11","The Limo"
"2697","Lily","Okay, I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep. Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?","01","11","The Limo"
"2698","Ted","Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us. I need you to power through the pain.","01","11","The Limo"
"2699","Lily","Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.","01","11","The Limo"
"2700","Barney","It's true. I can hear them. What's that, little boys? What's that? You wanna go for a... rock?","01","11","The Limo"
"2701","Ted","Ranjit! Party number two.","01","11","The Limo"
"2702","Ranjit","Party number two.","01","11","The Limo"
"2703","Ted","Party number two? Not so good.","01","11","The Limo"
"2704","Marshall","Let's go back to party number one.","01","11","The Limo"
"2705","Ted","No, no turning back. Ranjit, party number three.","01","11","The Limo"
"2706","Ranjit","Party number three. Yeah.","01","11","The Limo"
"2707","Barney","Oh, wait, wait, wait. We have to turn around. We left Natalya.","01","11","The Limo"
"2708","Lily","Barney, none of us really liked her.","01","11","The Limo"
"2709","Barney","What?!","01","11","The Limo"
"2710","Lily","Sorry.","01","11","The Limo"
"2711","Barney","Oh, very nice, Lily. You know, she is a guest in this country. So while you may chose to turn your back on her, I choose to turn my front on her. What up?","01","11","The Limo"
"2712","Ted","I'm sorry about Barney.","01","11","The Limo"
"2713","Mary Beth","No, I'm having a great time. I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.","01","11","The Limo"
"2714","Ted","Me, too. (Ted's phone starts ringing) Hey, Robin.","01","11","The Limo"
"2715","Robin","Ted, Derek stood me up.","01","11","The Limo"
"2716","Ted from 2030","Pfft. Derek. Now, we had a tight schedule to keep that night and I was already on a date with another girl. But... it was Robin.","01","11","The Limo"
"2717","Ted","Ranjit, turn it around.","01","11","The Limo"
"2718","Robin","Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this. You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up.","01","11","The Limo"
"2719","Ted","No, this is perfect. It's meant to be. We're all back together.","01","11","The Limo"
"2720","Lily","What happened?","01","11","The Limo"
"2721","Robin","Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal. Who works on New Year's Eve? Okay. Now I feel worse. I was really looking forward to this night. This sucks.","01","11","The Limo"
"2722","Marshall","Oh, dude, not now!","01","11","The Limo"
"2723","Barney","What? She needs to get psyched. Fine.","01","11","The Limo"
"2724","Robin","Maybe I should just go home.","01","11","The Limo"
"2725","Barney","My finger slipped.","01","11","The Limo"
"2726","Ted","Look, Robin, you're not going home. Come on, it's New Year's Eve. Look, so your date fell through. So what? What do you need a date for? Someone to kiss at midnight? Fine. I'll kiss you at... a little bit after midnight.","01","11","The Limo"
"2727","Robin","Hi, I'm Robin.","01","11","The Limo"
"2728","Mary Beth","Mary Beth.","01","11","The Limo"
"2729","Robin","You're friendly. I haven't eaten dinner yet. Is there anything to eat in this thing?","01","11","The Limo"
"2730","Ted","That's it. I know what you're jonesing for. Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!","01","11","The Limo"
"2731","Robin","Oh, yes. Ted, you rock.","01","11","The Limo"
"2732","Barney","We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs?","01","11","The Limo"
"2733","Marshall","Yeah, we like hot dogs.","01","11","The Limo"
"2734","Barney","No. No. We are already behind schedule. Ted, come on. We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit.","01","11","The Limo"
"2735","Ranjit","You don't know what you're missing.","01","11","The Limo"
"2736","Ted","Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.","01","11","The Limo"
"2737","Lily","Which is exactly how much time I need. Ranjit, stop the car.","01","11","The Limo"
"2738","Ranjit","Stopping the car.","01","11","The Limo"
"2739","Marshall","Wait. Baby, what are you doing?","01","11","The Limo"
"2740","Lily","I'm going home.","01","11","The Limo"
"2741","Ted","What? No!","01","11","The Limo"
"2742","Lily","I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't. There's a cab over there. I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.","01","11","The Limo"
"2743","Marshall","But... hot dogs.","01","11","The Limo"
"2744","Lily","Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.","01","11","The Limo"
"2745","Marshall","Okay, I'll go with you.","01","11","The Limo"
"2746","Lily","No, baby. Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at... party number three.","01","11","The Limo"
"2747","Marshall","Are you sure?","01","11","The Limo"
"2748","Lily","If I don't see you, happy new year.","01","11","The Limo"
"2749","Marshall","Don't say that. We'll find each other. We'll find each other.","01","11","The Limo"
"2750","Lily","I know we will. (Lily leaves the limo)","01","11","The Limo"
"2751","Marshall","Hell of a woman. Let's go get some hot dogs!","01","11","The Limo"
"2752","Ted","Ranjit, party number three.","01","11","The Limo"
"2753","Ranjit","Party number three.","01","11","The Limo"
"2754","Marshall","Oh, yeah! Look at us. Riding around in a limo. Eating hot dogs. It's like we're the president.","01","11","The Limo"
"2755","Ted","Hey. I'll bet you're feeling better now.","01","11","The Limo"
"2756","Robin","Oh, so much better.","01","11","The Limo"
"2757","Marshall","Guys. Is that Moby? I think that that's Moby.","01","11","The Limo"
"2758","Ted from 2030","Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young.","01","11","The Limo"
"2759","Ted","No way.","01","11","The Limo"
"2760","Robin","That's totally Moby. That's awesome.","01","11","The Limo"
"2761","Ted","Should I say something? I should say something, right? Moby! Hey, Moby!","01","11","The Limo"
"2762","Barney","Oh, my God. He's coming over. Everybody be cool. Everybody be cool.","01","11","The Limo"
"2763","Ted","Hey.","01","11","The Limo"
"2764","Moby","Hello.","01","11","The Limo"
"2765","Ted","What's up? Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?","01","11","The Limo"
"2766","Moby","Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.","01","11","The Limo"
"2767","Ted","You want a ride?","01","11","The Limo"
"2768","Moby","Sure.","01","11","The Limo"
"2769","Ted","Welcome.","01","11","The Limo"
"2770","Moby","Wow. You're friendly.","01","11","The Limo"
"2771","Barney","Big fan. Barney Stinson. So, uh... what about this party?","01","11","The Limo"
"2772","Moby","It's just a New Year's thing. You know, with some friends.","01","11","The Limo"
"2773","Robin","Wow, that sounds awesome.","01","11","The Limo"
"2774","Moby","You guys want to come?","01","11","The Limo"
"2775","Ted","Yeah, we'd love to.","01","11","The Limo"
"2776","Moby","All right.","01","11","The Limo"
"2777","Marshall","Uh, Ted. Sidebar?","01","11","The Limo"
"2778","Ted","Um... Moby, switch up, will you? Yeah, what's up?","01","11","The Limo"
"2779","Marshall","What about Lily?","01","11","The Limo"
"2780","Ted","Call her.","01","11","The Limo"
"2781","Marshall","I've been trying to call her. I can't get through. All the circuits are jammed.","01","11","The Limo"
"2782","Ted","That's New Year's Eve for you. Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards...","01","11","The Limo"
"2783","Marshall","No, I-I can't. Lily's waiting. I gotta... I gotta find her. Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.","01","11","The Limo"
"2784","Ted","But... Come on! Moby's party! Moby's party! Moby's par... Ranjit. Moby's party.","01","11","The Limo"
"2785","Ranjit","Moby's party.","01","11","The Limo"
"2786","Moby","This is a cool mix. You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall. I think it should be all rise.","01","11","The Limo"
"2787","Barney","Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher. This mix is my pride and joy. I never leave home without it.","01","11","The Limo"
"2788","Moby","Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here.","01","11","The Limo"
"2789","Barney","Jan... Aah!","01","11","The Limo"
"2790","Moby","So then I say, ""your motorcycle was like that when I got here.""","01","11","The Limo"
"2791","Ted","You're not Moby, are you?","01","11","The Limo"
"2792","Moby","Who?","01","11","The Limo"
"2793","Robin","Moby... the recording artist, Moby.","01","11","The Limo"
"2794","Moby","No.","01","11","The Limo"
"2795","Barney","But when we said, ""Hey, Moby,"" you said, ""Yeah.""","01","11","The Limo"
"2796","Not-Moby","I thought you said ""Tony.""","01","11","The Limo"
"2797","Ted","So your name is Tony?","01","11","The Limo"
"2798","Not-Moby","No. Oh, hey, we're here. All right. You guys going to come in?","01","11","The Limo"
"2799","Ted","Nah.","01","11","The Limo"
"2800","Not-Moby","You're sure? Come on. It's going to get nuts in there. There's this dude who owes me money.","01","11","The Limo"
"2801","Barney","No, uh, we're good. We're good. Happy New Year, Not Moby.","01","11","The Limo"
"2802","Not-Moby","Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.","01","11","The Limo"
"2803","Barney","Why did we think that guy was Moby?","01","11","The Limo"
"2804","Ted","I don't know. I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.","01","11","The Limo"
"2805","Barney","That's Marshall's phone. Hello.","01","11","The Limo"
"2806","Lily","Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.","01","11","The Limo"
"2807","Barney","Hey, sexy.","01","11","The Limo"
"2808","Lily","Barney, where's Marshall?","01","11","The Limo"
"2809","Barney","He left his phone in the limo. He's out looking for you.","01","11","The Limo"
"2810","Lily","What? Where?","01","11","The Limo"
"2811","Barney","Party number three.","01","11","The Limo"
"2812","Lily","Well, I'm here at party number three and... Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in... Moby!","01","11","The Limo"
"2813","Barney","Moby?! She's upstairs.","01","11","The Limo"
"2814","Ted","Lily, you have to get out of there this instant. That's not Moby.","01","11","The Limo"
"2815","Lily","Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo... Does he have a gun?","01","11","The Limo"
"2816","Ted","Run! Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four. What are the odds?","01","11","The Limo"
"2817","Lily","Who was that guy?!","01","11","The Limo"
"2818","Barney","Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.","01","11","The Limo"
"2819","Ted","Ranjit, drive!","01","11","The Limo"
"2820","Ranjit","Where to?","01","11","The Limo"
"2821","Ted","Party number three!","01","11","The Limo"
"2822","Ranjit","Party number three!","01","11","The Limo"
"2823","Lily","No, but I was just at party number three.","01","11","The Limo"
"2824","Ted","No, no, no, no you were at party number four. You must have looked at the list wrong.","01","11","The Limo"
"2825","Barney","Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for? It's time to... what? That's right, re-psych. Re-psy... Where's the...? Oh, my God! Not Moby took my ""Get Psyched"" mix!","01","11","The Limo"
"2826","Ted","Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it! Let it go. We need to get back on schedule.","01","11","The Limo"
"2827","Ranjit","Ah, nuts.","01","11","The Limo"
"2828","Ted","Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?","01","11","The Limo"
"2829","Ranjit","No. I am pissed. Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.","01","11","The Limo"
"2830","Ted","Okay Okay, not a problem. He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time.","01","11","The Limo"
"2831","Lily","I wish Marshall would call. I guess the circuits are jammed.","01","11","The Limo"
"2832","Barney","Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world. Everyone except Barney. Oh, sure, laugh. Laugh for Barney Stinson. Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze. Round and round it goes. And where's it all heading? Nowhere.","01","11","The Limo"
"2833","Robin","Is this just 'cause you lost your ""Get Psyched"" mix?","01","11","The Limo"
"2834","Barney","I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?","01","11","The Limo"
"2835","Robin","No. No, not tonight. Not in the limo. We got to stay psyched. Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's. (singing...) *Shot through the heart And you're to blame, darling*","01","11","The Limo"
"2836","Ted and Robin","*You give love a bad name*","01","11","The Limo"
"2837","Ranjit","*A bad name*","01","11","The Limo"
"2838","Ted and Robin","*I play my part and you played your game*","01","11","The Limo"
"2839","Mary Beth","I'm going to get some air.","01","11","The Limo"
"2840","Ted and Robin","*Darling, you give love a bad name, bad name!*","01","11","The Limo"
"2841","Ted","It'll be fine. We'll be out of here in a jiff.","01","11","The Limo"
"2842","Mary Beth","Ted, I'm going to head out. My roommates are having a party not far from here.","01","11","The Limo"
"2843","Ted","No. Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but...","01","11","The Limo"
"2844","Mary Beth","How long have you been in love with Robin?","01","11","The Limo"
"2845","Ted","I'm not in love... We're just friends. Where are you getting that from?","01","11","The Limo"
"2846","Mary Beth","Ted, it's okay. I'm fine. And I can tell that she's into you, too.","01","11","The Limo"
"2847","Ted","That's ridiculous. Wait. Really?","01","11","The Limo"
"2848","Mary Beth","Happy New Year, Ted.","01","11","The Limo"
"2849","Lily","I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.","01","11","The Limo"
"2850","Ted","Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party. It's no big deal.","01","11","The Limo"
"2851","Barney","The first time I rode in a limo I was five. I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral. I suppose, in a way, I still am.","01","11","The Limo"
"2852","Lily","Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here. I'm going to call Marshall.","01","11","The Limo"
"2853","Ted","But he left his phone.","01","11","The Limo"
"2854","Lily","Marshall! Marshall!","01","11","The Limo"
"2855","Robin","I'm sorry about your girl.","01","11","The Limo"
"2856","Ted","Sorry about your guy.","01","11","The Limo"
"2857","Robin","Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight. Did you forget about our little deal? Because I did not.","01","11","The Limo"
"2858","Ted","I did not, too.","01","11","The Limo"
"2859","Robin","Derek. Hi. How's work?","01","11","The Limo"
"2860","Ted","I'll give you some privacy.","01","11","The Limo"
"2861","Lily","Marshall!","01","11","The Limo"
"2862","Ted","Okay, how's this for a plan? We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12 45. We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time.","01","11","The Limo"
"2863","Lily","Marshall!","01","11","The Limo"
"2864","Barney","Give it a rest, Ted.","01","11","The Limo"
"2865","Ted","Give what a rest?","01","11","The Limo"
"2866","Barney","Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve which is the single biggest letdown of a night every single year.","01","11","The Limo"
"2867","Lily","Marshall!","01","11","The Limo"
"2868","Ted","Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around. We've still got ten minutes.","01","11","The Limo"
"2869","Barney","Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted. It doesn't exist.","01","11","The Limo"
"2870","Lily","Marshall!","01","11","The Limo"
"2871","Marshall","Lily!","01","11","The Limo"
"2872","Ted","Holy crap.","01","11","The Limo"
"2873","Lily","Marshall!","01","11","The Limo"
"2874","Marshall","I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually. So much to tell. I couldn't find Lily at party number three so I walked... I walked to the next party on the list.","01","11","The Limo"
"2875","Ted","Not Moby's party?","01","11","The Limo"
"2876","Marshall","Yes, Moby's party. Check it out. He signed my shirt. And guess what I found. Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it. Yeah, I know. Come on.","01","11","The Limo"
"2877","Barney","Come on! Oh! Oh!","01","11","The Limo"
"2878","Lily","Baby, baby, I was so worried about you. Why didn't you call me?","01","11","The Limo"
"2879","Marshall","I tried, baby. All the circuits were jammed. But wait, there's more. After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five. And so I went there, too, and it is awesome. I want to cry, it is so awesome. We have to go there.","01","11","The Limo"
"2880","Ted","How? We'll never get a cab.","01","11","The Limo"
"2881","Ranjit","The flat's fixed.","01","11","The Limo"
"2882","Ted","Let's do this! Come on! In! Go, go, go!","01","11","The Limo"
"2883","Lily","Natalya?","01","11","The Limo"
"2884","Barney","Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time. Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?","01","11","The Limo"
"2885","Ranjit","I didn't want to awake her. She looked so peaceful.","01","11","The Limo"
"2886","Ted","Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town. Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?","01","11","The Limo"
"2887","Ranjit","I get you there in six.","01","11","The Limo"
"2888","Ranjit","I don't think I can do it.","01","11","The Limo"
"2889","All","No! Come on!","01","11","The Limo"
"2890","Lily","Move, you stupid taxi!","01","11","The Limo"
"2891","Marshall","Three minutes!","01","11","The Limo"
"2892","All","Come on!","01","11","The Limo"
"2893","Ted","Ranjit, put her in park. Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome, but it's not the best party in New York. 'Cause this is, right here.","01","11","The Limo"
"2894","Barney","Cheers. Well said.","01","11","The Limo"
"2895","All","Cheers.","01","11","The Limo"
"2896","Ted from 2030","And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve. The funny thing is all night long, I'd been trying to chase something down that was right there in that limo.","01","11","The Limo"
"2897","Robin","Derek?! Derek.","01","11","The Limo"
"2898","Derek","Hey.","01","11","The Limo"
"2899","Ted","Hey, uh, come on in.","01","11","The Limo"
"2900","Derek","I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.","01","11","The Limo"
"2901","Robin","I can't believe you made it.","01","11","The Limo"
"2902","Derek","I made it, baby.","01","11","The Limo"
"2903","Natalia","I super love you, okay?","01","11","The Limo"
"2904","Barney","Here, you need a mint.","01","11","The Limo"
"2905","All","Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year!","01","11","The Limo"
"2906","Ted from 2030","You probably want to feel bad for your old man at this point in the story. Well, don't. Not every night has a happy ending. But all of it's important. All of it was leading somewhere. Because suddenly, it was 2006. And 2006 was a big one.","01","11","The Limo"
"2907","Robin","What the hell, man? I thought we had a deal.","01","11","The Limo"
"2908","Ted","What about your guy? It's midnight. Go kiss him.","01","11","The Limo"
"2909","Robin","Eh, he kept me waiting. I can keep him waiting.","01","11","The Limo"
"2910","Ted","Well, a deal is a deal.","01","11","The Limo"
"2911","Robin","Happy New Year.","01","11","The Limo"
"2912","Ted","Happy New Year.","01","11","The Limo"
"2913","Future Ted VO","When you're single and your friends start to get married, every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation. Will you be bringing a guest or will you be attending alone? What it's really asking is where do you see yourself in three months? Sitting next to your girlfriend or hitting on a bridesmaid? I always checked that I was bringing a guest. I was an optimist.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2914","Ted","Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2915","Barney","Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted  For the most part, yeah.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2916","Barney","You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2917","Ted","Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2918","Barney","Ted, it's a simile.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2919","Ted","Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date, a $200 piece of chicken-slash-salmon will go uneaten. I gotta bring someone, but who?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2920","Future Ted VO","Of course I knew who I wanted to bring  Robin.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2921","Future Ted VO","The big unanswered question in my life. Problem was, she was dating this really rich guy named Derek.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2922","Future Ted VO","Pft, Derek.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2923","Robin","Well, Derek and I just broke up.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2924","Lily","No, that's terrible, are you OK?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2925","Marshall","Yeah, do you need a drink or something?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2926","Robin","Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2927","Barney","Don't beat yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2928","Robin","Thanks, I feel a lot better. Think I'll get that drink now.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2929","Ted","OK, guys, I gotta say something. I think my feelings for Robin may be resurfacing.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2930","Lily","Oh, because they were buried in a shallow grave.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2931","Marshall","Not again. Come on, dude, we all know how this movie ends. Ted falls in love. Love kicks Ted in the sprouts. Roll credits.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2932","Ted","No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture. Fact.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2933","Ted","Robin was into me when we first met. Fact.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2934","Ted","Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof. Fact.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2935","Ted","On New Year's Eve, we kissed again. Fact.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2936","Ted","I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck","01","12","The Wedding"
"2937","Barney","What I don't get is, why is Claudia marrying Stuart? She's way hotter than him. How way? Way way.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2938","Marshall","This wedding does sound pretty amazing though. Fancy hotel ballroom, everybody all dressed up.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2939","Lily","Ah, here we go.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2940","Barney","What?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2941","Lily","We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2942","Marshall","Oh yeah, OK, that's a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2943","Lily","I thought so.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2944","Marshall","You know what, excuse me if I don't wanna get married barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-one's-gonna-drive-that-far. Yes, I want a ballroom and I want a band and I want shoes.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2945","Lily","A little girl?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2946","Barney","What up?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2947","Lily","Yes, but I'm the bride so I win.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2948","Marshall","Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2949","Lily","Right. But I'm the bride, so I win.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2950","Barney","Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2951","Ted","You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship is to celebrate someone else's successful one.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2952","Robin","Well, makes sense.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2953","Ted","So, with that mind, our friends Claudia and Stuart are having this crazy, black-tie wedding on Saturday. You wanna be my 'plus one'?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2954","Robin","Ooh, 'plus one', you make it sound so romantic. Ted  Fine. You wanna be my date?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2955","Robin","Your date? I'd love to. Um, how fancy are we talking about here?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2956","Ted","Oh, you're gonna wanna bring your A game.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2957","Robin","Oh, I'll bring it. I'll bring it so hard the bride's gonna look like a big white bag of crap.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2958","Robin","Lily, I need a dress.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2959","Lily","You're going. That's awesome. Oh my God, four days to find a dress?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2960","Robin","I know, it's a suicide mission.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2961","Lily","Well, if we leave now, we can still have a fighting chance. Let's do it.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2962","Marshall","Bye babe.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2963","Ted","Whoa, did you see how fired up she was? I don't know, there's something there. And come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne. Who knows? Barney  Wow, Ted, you're gonna have to find another gender for yourself 'cause I'm revoking your dude membership.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2964","Ted","Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2965","Barney","Invigorating, thanks.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2966","Future Ted VO","OK, I wasn't going to say it in front of the guys but back then I really thought that's how it worked.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2967","Future Ted VO","You put yourself and a girl you like in some romantic setting. The stars line up and shazam.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2968","Future Ted VO","I know now that life is never that simple.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2969","Ted","Hey, Claudia!","01","12","The Wedding"
"2970","Claudia","(on phone) Yes, I want Tahitian vanilla. You wrote it down wrong? No no no no no, listen to me. If I go to my wedding and the cake is not Tahitian vanilla, I will come down there and burn your little shop to the ground. Do you wanna find out if I'm kidding? Good-bye.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2971","Ted","Hey, how's it going? Claudia  My wedding's in two days, that's how it's going.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2972","Ted","Oh, don't worry, it's gonna be great. I'm so excited.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2973","Claudia","You should be, lots of single girls.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2974","Ted","Oh, well, yeah, I'm bringing a date, so I'll be off the market.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2975","Claudia","What? Ted  I'm bringing a date.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2976","Claudia","You're not bringing a date.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2977","Ted","Uh, yes I am.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2978","Claudia","Uh, no you're not.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2979","Ted","I checked 'plus one'.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2980","Claudia","No you didn't.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2981","Ted","Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked...","01","12","The Wedding"
"2982","Claudia","Ted, you did not check 'plus one', you are not bringing a date to my wedding.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2983","Ted","But I already invited someone.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2984","Claudia","You are not bringing a guest, Ted. The guest list has been closed for months. Months!","01","12","The Wedding"
"2985","Ted","But I checked 'plus one'. I always check 'plus one'.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2986","Claudia","You absolutely did not check 'plus one'. If you had checked 'plus one', I would have called you to get the name of your guest so I could get the guest cards printed up. Did I call you to get the name of your guest? Is there a place card with her name card printed on it?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2987","Ted","She doesn't need a place card, she knows her name.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2988","Claudia","What's she eating? You ordered the chicken, what did she order? Do you see how your story is full of holes?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2989","Ted","Come on, Claudia, we go way back. Isn't there room for just one more person?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2990","Claudia","Don't make me hurt you Ted.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2991","Ted","I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2992","Barney","But to be fair, she's also hot.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2993","Ted","I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2994","Barney","Yeah, right.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2995","Ted","I did.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2996","Barney","Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?","01","12","The Wedding"
"2997","Ted","Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech.","01","12","The Wedding"
"2998","Barney","Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move...","01","12","The Wedding"
"2999","Ted, Marshall","A little Barney.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3000","Barney","A little Barney. And you know what he said? (changing tone of voice) ""Ted, you will bring no dates to this wedding. You will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney.""","01","12","The Wedding"
"3001","Marshall","Wow.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3002","Ted","Please stop. I gotta call Claudia. If I just explain to her...","01","12","The Wedding"
"3003","Marshall","Ted, no. Let it go. She's about to get married. She's got enough to worry about.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3004","Ted","Then what am I gonna do?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3005","Marshall","The only thing you can do. Tell Robin she can't come.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3006","Robin","(from inside apartment) Just a second.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3007","Lily","Hey.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3008","Ted","Hey, listen.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3009","Lily","Wait, two things. First of all, I've been laying groundwork all afternoon, totally subtle, totally cool, not pushing, not even nudging. Just the theme of today is Ted rocks. And she's picking up on it lying down.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3010","Ted","Lily's there's a problem.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3011","Lily","Wait, no, thing number two. The dress, we got a dress.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3012","Lily","Go.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3013","Robin","Well, did I bring it? Or did I bring it?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3014","Robin","I think I brought it.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3015","Ted","Wow.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3016","Robin","That's what I was going for. I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're gonna have so much fun.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3017","Ted","Yeah, about that.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3018","Lily","So, the dress?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3019","Ted","I don't have a 'plus one' for the wedding.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3020","Lily","What?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3021","Ted","I ran into Claudia and she told me I didn't check 'plus one' on the reply card.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3022","Lily","Why didn't you check 'plus...","01","12","The Wedding"
"3023","Ted","I did check 'plus one'.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3024","Lily","But Robin is so excited.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3025","Ted","I know.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3026","Lily","And the dress.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3027","Ted","I know.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3028","Lily","Oh. OK, OK, we'll, we'll sneak her in.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3029","Ted","We can't sneak her in, we're not ninjas.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3030","Lily","I wish we were ninjas.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3031","Ted","I know.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3032","Lily","You can always ask Stuart.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3033","Ted","Can I do that?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3034","Lily","Sure, you guys have been friends for a long time, and it's 40% his wedding too.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3035","Ted","Oh, it's gonna be a tough sell.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3036","Stuart","Dude, no problem whatsoever.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3037","Ted","Really? Stuart  Sure, the more the merrier.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3038","Ted","Wow, wow, thanks for being so cool about this 'cause you know Claudia said...","01","12","The Wedding"
"3039","Stuart","Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, this morning at the rehearsal, Claudia called our 7-year-old flower girl a whore. So, don't take it personally, she's just a little stressed.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3040","Ted","Yeah, she's not usually like that.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3041","Stuart","No.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3042","Ted","Well, thanks, Stu, it's gonna be a great wedding.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3043","Lily","Honey, this magazine says more and more couples are opting to have nontraditional weddings out in the woods.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3044","Marshall","Well, if a magazine says so, we should go get married in the woods like a couple of squirrels.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3045","Lily","Squirrels don't get married, Marshall.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3046","Marshall","Like you could possibly know that.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3047","Ted","I did it. I did it. I'm taking her to the wedding.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3048","Lily","Nice.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3049","Marshall","What? How?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3050","Ted","I talked to Stuart.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3051","Marshall","Oh, you went around the bride. ""Oh, this hornet's nest looks harmless. Maybe I'll poke it with a stick. Oh, look, some gremlins, let me go feed them after midnight."" Did you known about this?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3052","Lily","It may have been my idea.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3053","Lily","What? Stuart doesn't get a say.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3054","Marshall","Ha! So you admit it, the groom should have an equal say.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3055","Lily","Oh, yeah, sure, on the stupid stuff, like who comes.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3056","Marshall","So I can invite whoever I want.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3057","Lily","Sure, there's plenty of room in the woods.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3058","Ted","It's Claudia.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3059","Marshall","So, it begins.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3060","Ted","Come on, it can't be that bad.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3061","Ted","Here, Lily, you answer it.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3062","Lily","What? Why?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3063","Ted","Because this whole thing was your idea. And Claudia scares me.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3064","Lily","But...but you're the guy...oh.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3065","Lily","Ted's phone. Oh, hi Claudia. What?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3066","Future Ted VO","Now I wasn't there, but what I heard, it went something like this.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3067","Stuart","Uh, by the way, honey, Ted stopped by and I told him he could bring his date to the wedding.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3068","Claudia","You what?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3069","Stuart","I told him he could bring a date to the wedding.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3070","Claudia","Always undermining me at every turn.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3071","Stuart","Try to show a little flexibility, but no, it's all about you.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3072","Claudia","And your mother, calling me all the time...","01","12","The Wedding"
"3073","Stuart","You know what, the wedding's off.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3074","Lily","They broke up.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3075","Ted","Ow!","01","12","The Wedding"
"3076","Lily","(to Claudia on phone) Uh-huh, uh-huh.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3077","Ted","It's not because of me, is it?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3078","Lily","Uh-huh.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3079","Claudia","My dad already paid for this huge wedding. He's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill Ted, then I'm gonna kill Ted.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3080","Ted","It's Robin.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3081","Lily","Answer it.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3082","Ted","Uh, Lily's phone.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3083","Robin","Ted. Where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3084","Ted","Uh, Lily's busy.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3085","Robin","Oh, OK, well I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's gonna love them.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3086","Ted","That's great. I'll tell Lily to tell me. Uh, listen, I really wanna keep talking but now's not a good time so, um, I'm really excited about tomorrow. OK, bye.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3087","Robin","Bye-bye.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3088","Ted","Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this. Do you think she's into me?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3089","Marshall","Ted, focus.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3090","Lily","Sweetie, just calm down. Do you wanna go somewhere and talk?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3091","Claudia","I wanna go somewhere and drink.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3092","Lily","OK, meet me at MacLaren's. I'll see you there.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3093","Ted","I feel terrible.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3094","Marshall","Well, feel terrible later. Right now, we gotta fix this. Lily, you go down to the bar and comfort Claudia. Ted and I will go and try to talk some sense into Stuart.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3095","Ted","Tell Claudia I'm sorry. Did she seem pissed at me?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3096","Lily","She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3097","Ted","Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3098","Barney","Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia  Stuart and I just broke up.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3099","Barney","Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just... (to bartender) two vodka cranberries.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3100","Claudia","You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3101","Barney","Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3102","Barney","(to bartender) They all drink vodka cranberries.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3103","Barney","So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3104","Claudia","You got $400,000?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3105","Barney","No, but I do have a hug.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3106","Barney","(looking up, whispers) Thank you.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3107","Ted","Stuart, I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...","01","12","The Wedding"
"3108","Stuart","Ted, for all I know you did me the biggest favor anyone's every done me.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3109","Marshall","Oh, come on, man, you don't mean that.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3110","Stuart","Yeah, I do. This whole thing's made me realize, I miss being single. I miss staying out late and making messes and not cleaning them up. I miss owning p0rn.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3111","Marshall","Dude, who doesn't.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3112","Stuart","You know, I'll see some super-hot model chick and I'll think, ""why am I with Claudia? I can be with her.""","01","12","The Wedding"
"3113","Ted","That's crazy. I mean, you're the luckiest...you and Claudia both...","01","12","The Wedding"
"3114","Stuart","The point is, I wanna get married, I wanna settle down. But right now, that's just not who I am. I'm not a commitment guy, I'm a single guy.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3115","Ted","Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other. Everybody feels this way sometimes.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3116","Stuart","How would you know, you're not even married?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3117","Ted","OK, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily. He's the pro. This guy knows relationships. Tell him, Marshall.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3118","Marshall","Stuart, don't get married.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3119","Ted","Dude.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3120","Stuart","What?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3121","Marshall","I'm sorry. Being in a couple is hard and committing, making sacrifices, it's hard. But if it's the right person, then it's easy. Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life, that should be the easiest thing in the world. And if it's not like that, then she's not the one. I'm sorry.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3122","Ted","You know I don't have $400,000, right?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3123","Barney","That's just, that's... (yelling over to bartender) two more vodka cranberries please.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3124","Barney","Claudia, it's all gonna be OK.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3125","Claudia","Thanks for listening, Barney. Really means a lot to me.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3126","Barney","Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3127","Lily","Oh, hell no.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3128","Barney","Oww","01","12","The Wedding"
"3129","Lily","Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3130","Barney","Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily  One of each.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3131","Barney","All right, all right.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3132","Stuart","Claudia.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3133","Claudia","Stuart. I'm so sorry.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3134","Stuart","I'm so sorry too.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3135","Claudia","I love you.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3136","Stuart","I love you too, babe. Marshall and Ted set me straight, and when Marshall told me not to marry you, it made me realize...","01","12","The Wedding"
"3137","Claudia","Marshall said what?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3138","Stuart","He made me realize how much I love you. These guys got us back together.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3139","Ted","So, where did we land on the whole 'plus one' thing?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3140","Ted","Still wow.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3141","Robin","Wow yourself. Look who else brought it.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3142","Ted","Oh yeah, I thought about leaving it at home, but I figured I don't wanna get there and realize I need it and have to go all the way back to get it, so, yeah, I brought it.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3143","Robin","Sorry.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3144","Robin","Hello. Oh my God, tonight? You're kidding. Robin  (to Ted) They want me to anchor the news tonight.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3145","Robin","Really? Like, anchor anchor? What happened to Sandy? OK, OK, sure, what time do you need me to...Right now! Oh.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3146","Ted","Do it. Do it.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3147","Robin","OK, I need like five minutes to change and um, I'll call you from the cab...","01","12","The Wedding"
"3148","Marshall","So, admit it, this wedding is both indoors and amazing.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3149","Lily","I'll give you the crab puffs. The crab puffs are good.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3150","Marshall","Crab puffs were incredible.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3151","Lily","We should totally have them at our wedding.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3152","Marshall","Definitely. Hey, we just agreed on something.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3153","Lily","Did we just start planning our wedding?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3154","Marshall","I think we did.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3155","Lily","We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3156","Marshall","Oh, I thought the red sauce was like aweome.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3157","Lily","My God, were you born without taste buds? (Marshall smiles and laughs)","01","12","The Wedding"
"3158","Lily","What?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3159","Marshall","I love you.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3160","Robin","Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3161","Barney","Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3162","Ted","What's a sixteen?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3163","Barney","Those two eight's right over there. Yeah.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3164","Claudia","Hi Ted.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3165","Ted","Claudia.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3166","Claudia","We just wanted to get a picture with the woman who almost ended our relationship.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3167","Stuart","Yeah, where is she?","01","12","The Wedding"
"3168","Ted","Um (clears throat) She couldn't make it.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3169","Ted","What's so funny? Claudia  Plan a wedding, you'll see.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3170","Ted","Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3171","Barney","Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3172","Claudia","By the way, I almost forgot. We found this.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3173","Ted","I didn't check 'plus one'. You were right. Barney  Of course I was right.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3174","Ted","I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3175","Barney","Being single's the best.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3176","Ted","Stay out as late as you want.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3177","Barney","Answer to no one.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3178","Ted","The whole world full of endless possibilities.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3179","Barney","Never having to go to a farmer's market.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3180","Barney","OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me...","01","12","The Wedding"
"3181","Future Ted VO","So there we were, two single guys doing our usual single guy thing. For whatever reason, I had let myself believe that this night would be a turning point, that this was the night that my life, my real life, would finally begin. Funny thing is, I wasn't totally wrong.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3182","Future Ted VO","'Cause that night was just beginning.","01","12","The Wedding"
"3183","Future Ted VO","Kids, in life there are a lot of big romantic moments, and they make life worth living. But here's the problem, moments pass, and lurking just around the corner from those moments is a cruel, unshaven b*st*rd named reality.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3184","Future Ted VO","And so, back in 2006, on the night of Claudia and Stuart's wedding, reality was the enemy.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3185","Tanya","Wow, the Peace Corps?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3186","Barney","Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, ""Is it?"" And usually they say, ""yes it is.""","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3187","Tanya","Barney, they are so right. I wish there was something I could do.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3188","Barney","Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3189","Future Ted VO","This wasn't how I thought the night would turn out.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3190","Future Ted VO","This was finally supposed to be my big moment with Robin. But then reality came along.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3191","Future Ted VO","Robin got called up last minute to anchor the 11 o'clock news. It was her big break.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3192","Future Ted VO","And I went to the wedding stag. Then, when I least expected it...","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3193","Lily","Hey, where the hell did you disappear to last night?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3194","Ted","I had the most amazing night ever.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3195","Marshall","Tell me about it, that cake, best cake I ever had. Seriously. My stomach was like, hey bro, I don't know what you're eating 'cause I don't have any eyes but it's basically awesome so keep sending it down gullet alley.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3196","Lily","Yeah, I know. My stomach was like, girlfriend, we don't always get along but that cake...","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3197","Marshall","Say what?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3198","Ted","Lily.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3199","Lily","Oh right. Most amazing night ever, and go.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3200","Victoria","I should tell you, I have a rule. I never hook up at weddings.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3201","Ted","I'm guessing you haven't always had this rule.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3202","Victoria","Well, here's the thing. Those big romantic moments, they're great when they happen, but they're not real.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3203","Ted","Exactly. Exactly, like, like just now, when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there, I'm not gonna lie to you, big time thunderbolt.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3204","Victoria","You should see me tap-dance. You'd be down on bended knee.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3205","Ted","Sadly not out of character. But I know now it's just a mirage.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3206","Victoria","Wedding goggles.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3207","Ted","Exactly. And that, in a nutshell, is why I'm not putting the moves on you.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3208","Victoria","This isn't the moves?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3209","Ted","What, you think this is the moves? Believe me, you'd know the moves. People ten tables away would know the moves.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3210","Victoria","That's too bad.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3211","Ted","Tell me about it.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3212","Victoria","You know, I think I have a solution.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3213","Ted","Interested.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3214","Victoria","And, to preface this, we're not going to sleep together tonight.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3215","Ted","Less interested.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3216","Ted","Go ahead.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3217","Victoria","OK. So the thing that always screws it up is the next day, right? So, why don't we just cut that part out.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3218","Ted","What are you saying?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3219","Victoria","I'm saying, I'm here, you're here, and this is a big, romantic wedding. Why don't we just dance and have a great time and then when it's over, never see each other again.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3220","Ted","Unless...","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3221","Victoria","No, no unless. No emails, no phone numbers, not even names. Tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished. And then, when we're old and gray, we'll look back on this night and it'll be perfect.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3222","Ted","Wow. OK, I'm in.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3223","Victoria","OK.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3224","Ted","I guess, what, we'll need fake names?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3225","Victoria","Um, you can call me Buttercup.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3226","Ted","Pleased to meet you, Buttercup. I'm Lando Calrissian.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3227","Ted","Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded...","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3228","Barney","Ted, Ted, Ted, look, I got a bridesmaid, Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid, Ted, look. See ya Ted.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3229","Ted","So, I'm Ted.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3230","Victoria","Victoria. But no last names.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3231","Ted","No last names.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3232","Marshall","Oh.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3233","Lily","Oh, what is wrong with you?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3234","Marshall","Dude, that is just like... a weenie ass idea.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3235","Ted","No, it was awesome. I had a great night, I'm never gonna see her again, and there's no way to ruin it.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3236","Marshall","Ted, how do I explain this to you? Last night I had the best cake of my life. You think I'm gonna let that cake out of my life? Hell, no. I'm gonna find out what bakery made that cake and then I'm gonna get some more cake.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3237","Ted","That cake really got to you, huh?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3238","Marshall","It haunts me.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3239","Lily","So, what happened next?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3240","Ted","Mm-hm.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3241","Victoria","Now let's see some of these moves I've heard so much about.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3242","Victoria","Wait wait wait wait wait.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3243","Victoria","Let's do all the single ladies in this joint a big favor and steal the bouquet.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3244","Ted","Yes, but we'll need a diversion.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3245","Ted","Kiss.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3246","Ted","Go. Go, go, go","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3247","Lily","So, that's what happened to the bouquet. You know, good for Victoria. It's such an evil tradition.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3248","Ted","You're not gonna do it at your wedding?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3249","Lily","Oh, yeah, I'm gonna take that flower grenade and chuck it into the crowd and scream, crawl for it, bitches. It's just what girls do.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3250","Marshall","So, where did you guys go?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3251","Ted","Very nice.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3252","Victoria","Yeah?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3253","Victoria","OK, I don't really know how to tap-dance.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3254","Ted","I couldn't really tell.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3255","Ted","Well, it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3256","Victoria","Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3257","Ted","No you couldn't.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3258","Victoria","You're a dude. I could totally...","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3259","Ted","Totally get some.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3260","Victoria","We're not gonna kiss tonight.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3261","Victoria","If we kiss, all of this becomes real. You, you might use too much tongue, or not use enough and then suddenly, poof, spell's broken.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3262","Ted","I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3263","Victoria","OK, how about this? The best part of any first-kiss is the lead-up to it, the moment right before the lips touch. It's like a big drumroll. So, how about, tonight, we just stick with the drumroll.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3264","Ted","OK.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3265","Victoria","But we can't kiss.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3266","Ted","OK.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3267","Marshall","A drumroll? That's it. So, what, you just said good-night, came home, and performed a drum solo?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3268","Lily","Oh, Ted, you're such a doof. I mean, this girl sounds amazing.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3269","Ted","She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and we connected on every level. And, I'm never gonna see her again.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3270","Ted","Dammit, I have to see her again.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3271","Lily, Marshall","Yes.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3272","Marshall","So, let's get to work, man. What else do you know about her?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3273","Ted","Nothing. Her name's Victoria, that's all I got. Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3274","Lily","Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon. She'll be back in two weeks. Call her then.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3275","Ted","Yes, two weeks, good idea. I'm calling her now.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3276","Lily","No, Ted, you don't mess with a honeymoon.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3277","Marshall","Yeah, come on, dude. Ask her about the cake.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3278","Claudia","Ted?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3279","Claudia","Oh, you have got to be freakin kidding me.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3280","Stuart","Oh, here we go.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3281","Claudia","24 hours ago, you were begging, begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding, and now, what, you're over her?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3282","Ted","I've moved on.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3283","Claudia","What was her name? Was it my fat cousin, Lindsay? Don't be embarrassed. She has pretty eyes.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3284","Ted","Uh, no, her name was Victoria, I don't know her last name.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3285","Claudia","Well, lucky for you, I know that guest list backwards and forwards.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3286","Ted","Thank God.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3287","Claudia","Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria at my wedding. Good-bye, Ted.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3288","Ted","There was no Victoria at the wedding.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3289","Lily","Maybe she used a second fake name. Oh, she's good, she's very good.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3290","Marshall","Maybe she was a ghost. That's why she didn't wanna kiss you, because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second. Oh my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3291","Ted","Marshall. She was not a ghost.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3292","Marshall","I know that she wasn't a ghost, she picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3293","Ted","Wait, wait, wait, she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids. She must have been at their table. Maybe they know who she was?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3294","Lily","Great. How do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3295","Barney","This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3296","Nirvana","Barney.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3297","Barney","Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3298","Ted","Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3299","Barney","You know I did.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3300","Ted","Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3301","Barney","You know I won't.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3302","Ted","Why not?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3303","Barney","Because we just hooked up last night. I can't call the girl the next day. I have to wait at least, like, forever. Oh snap. Never gonna call her. Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3304","Lily","Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3305","Barney","Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3306","Ted","OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3307","Barney","Really? Ted  Yeah.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3308","Barney","But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3309","Ted","I'm ready to be proven wrong.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3310","Barney","Tonight? Ted  Tonight. Dial.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3311","Barney","(on phone) Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3312","Barney","(to Ted) What kind of shoes...","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3313","Barney","(on phone) Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3314","Ted","Actually.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3315","Barney","Oh come on.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3316","Victoria","Hey.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3317","Ted","So, what do you want to do next?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3318","Victoria","Uh...","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3319","Ted","Don't think...first thing that comes into your mind.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3320","Victoria","Hold this.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3321","Ted","Whoa. There she goes.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3322","Barney","(on phone) Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3323","Barney","Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3324","Ted","I understand.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3325","Lily","OK, let's not lose hope. We'll call the hotel, maybe she was staying there. We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria. Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3326","Marshall","Or Ictor. Probably doesn't go by Ictor.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3327","Ted","No, you know what? This is fate. I am never supposed to see this girl again. That was the whole point of the night. I've just been saved from myself. Let's drink many beers.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3328","Marshall","Agreed.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3329","Future Ted VO","And I thought that was the end of it, but then...","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3330","Lily","Hey, there's the anchor lady! How was it?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3331","Robin","Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor. Robin? Thanks, Robin, it was awesome. Back to you, Robin.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3332","Lily","Congrats, that's so cool.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3333","Robin","Yeah, I felt really bad bailing on Ted though.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3334","Lily","Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3335","Future Ted VO","And then Lily told her the whole story, right down to the brown shoes with the little snowflakes on them, and by the end of it...","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3336","Lily","What?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3337","Robin","I know who she is.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3338","Lily","You know who she is? But, you weren't even at the wedding.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3339","Robin","Actually, I kind of was.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3340","Lily","What?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3341","Robin","Well, after the newscast, I was so excited, I decided to surprise Ted by going to the reception.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3342","Robin","Dammit. Stop it. What the hell?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3343","Victoria","Hello? You OK in there?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3344","Robin","Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just allergies or something. I'm fine.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3345","Victoria","Listen, do you wanna come and cry out here? I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3346","Robin","Oh, thanks, but I don't actually cry in front of people, or cry at all for that matter. Man, it's gross. Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3347","Victoria","Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter. So, why are you crying?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3348","Lily","Because you have feelings for Ted.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3349","Robin","I don't know, maybe.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3350","Lily","OK, what is wrong with the two of you?! Seriously. He likes you and you like him, just, just, just be together. Geez, Louise, happiness is not that difficult.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3351","Robin","Oh, look, OK. Yes, I cried in the bathroom, and that was weird. But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy. The fact is I don't know how I feel.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3352","Lily","Yes you do. Seeing him with someone else and crying about it. Guess what? That's how you feel. That is nothing but how you feel.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3353","Robin","OK, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy? Lily  Kinda, yeah.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3354","Robin","But it doesn't change anything. I still don't wanna get married and he's still... Ted. What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he could be happy.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3355","Lily","Or you could tell him you're into him and then you could both be happy.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3356","Robin","I'm gonna go find him.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3357","Lily","Well, wait. Which one are you gonna tell him?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3358","Robin","I have no idea.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3359","Barney","And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for s*x.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3360","Barney","I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3361","Robin","Hi, guys,","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3362","Ted","Hey.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3363","Robin","Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3364","Ted","Sure. What's up?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3365","Robin","Uh, I, I have to tell you something.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3366","Ted","Oh.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3367","Robin","Oh, just get it.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3368","Ted","Hello.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3369","Stuart","Ted, it's Stuart. My lovely bride would like to say something to you.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3370","Claudia","Ted. I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier. My new husband and a vodka cranberry which cost $10.50 at the freakin' airport bar. When is this plane going to board?!","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3371","Stuart","Sweet pea.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3372","Claudia","Have helped me realize that sometimes I can act like a crazy person. And I don't want my new husband to think I'm a crazy person.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3373","Ted","It's fine, Claudia. Don't worry about it.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3374","Ted","Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3375","Claudia","Cake.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3376","Victoria","Why don't you take this? Sounds like you could use it.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3377","Robin","Thanks. You're very sweet. So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3378","Claudia","We got it at this little bakery downtown.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3379","Victoria","Actually, neither.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3380","Claudia","It's called the Buttercup Bakery.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3381","Victoria","I made the cake.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3382","Ted","She made the cake.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3383","Ted","Buttercup Bakery. She wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest. She made the cake.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3384","Marshall","She made that cake. Ted, this is the girl. You gotta marry her, today. She has to move in with us.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3385","Ted","I'm going down to that bakery.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3386","Lily","No, no, don't do it.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3387","Marshall","Baby, what are you talking about?!","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3388","Ted","Yeah, all day long, you've been busting my apple bag about finding this girl.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3389","Lily","Well, I just think that maybe she's not that into you and that's why she didn't give you her number. Robin, care to chime in with anything? Robin  Yes. Ted. Go get her.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3390","Ted","Going. Getting.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3391","Barney","Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up!","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3392","Ted","Yes! No.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3393","Barney","Oh come on!","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3394","Ted","Whoa. Guess we were gone a while.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3395","Victoria","Well, that's too bad. I was looking forward to one last dance.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3396","Ted","Why yes I am. Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3397","Victoria","Wow, what was I thinking?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3398","Ted","Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3399","Victoria","You got me, you are good.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3400","Ted","You know, I don't look like this every day. On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3401","Victoria","The real Ted sounds real sexy. It's too bad I'll never get to see it.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3402","Lily","Buttercup Bakery. This is it.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3403","Marshall","Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3404","Barney","Ted, you still with us?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3405","Ted","Tell me your last name.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3406","Ted","You know, there's one little flaw in our plan.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3407","Victoria","What's that?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3408","Ted","I'm gonna go home tonight with a lot of great memories and one really sucky memory  the memory of you walking out that door.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3409","Victoria","Hey, Ted.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3410","Ted","Yeah?","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3411","Victoria","Close your eyes, and count to five.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3412","Ted","One, two, three, four, five.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3413","Ted","And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be...","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3414","Barney","The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3415","Ted","OK.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3416","Victoria","Oh thank God.","01","13","Drumroll, Please"
"3417","Ted from 2030","When you meet someone special, suddenly life is full of firsts. The first kiss. The first night together. The first weekend together. For me, all those firsts happened within 48 hours of meeting Victoria.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3418","Marshall","They have to come out soon, it's Monday.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3419","Lily","Do you think they've been in there the whole time? I don't know whether to be proud or concerned.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3420","Marshall","Maybe they're not even in there.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3421","Victoria","Good morning.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3422","Ted","Hey, guys.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3423","Victoria","I'm just going to ignore that.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3424","Marshall","Thank you!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3425","Ted","I wish you could stay.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3426","Victoria","I know, me, too. But I have to go to work, and you have that meeting.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3427","Ted","Call you afterwards?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3428","Victoria","I'll inappropriately text you during. Bye.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3429","Ted","Bye.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3430","Marshall","Two days straight?!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3431","Lily","Wow, your room must smell like a monkey cage!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3432","Marshall","Come on, give us a number. Lily guessed eight, but I know my boy got to double digits.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3433","Ted","Zero.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3434","Marshall","What?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3435","Lily","What?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3436","Ted","Guys, we just met. And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick, so we talked about it, and we decided to take this one slow.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3437","Marshall","Her idea.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3438","Ted","Totally her idea! But, I don't know, I'm really into this girl, and if going slow is what it takes to make this happen, I say bring it on.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3439","Ted","I don't feel so good. t's like my testicles mixed pop rocks and soda.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3440","Marshall","I can't believe she's making you wait a whole month. I would never put up with that.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3441","Ted","You've only had s*x with one girl in your whole life.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3442","Lily","Burn!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3443","Barney","Ted, the only reason to wait a month for s*x is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3444","Robin","Good news  I don't have to cover the cat show tomorrow night. Who's up for hanging out?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3445","Ted","Oh, I can't, I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3446","Lily","No, no, we can't, it's our nine-year anniversary.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3447","Robin","Wow, nine years? Your relationship's a fourth grader. Congrats.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3448","Lily","Thanks. We're going to the Berkshires for the maple syrup harvest.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3449","Marshall","It's one of New York Magazine's ""Top five romantic getaways on a budget."" Who says sexual can't be sensible?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3450","Robin","Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3451","Barney","Really?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3452","Robin","Actually, I was talking to my martini.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3453","Marshall","Ready to go?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3454","Lily","Hell, yeah. Nothing better than a weekend at a good bed and breakfast.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3455","Marshall","Yeah. Waking up for breakfast at 7 00 A.M....Sharp.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3456","Lily","Complimenting the odors and their collection of needle-point geese.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3457","Marshall","Awkward conversations with middle-aged couples trying to stave off divorce.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3458","Lily","Yeah, well, we'd better get going, it's like a four-hour drive.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3459","Marshall","And it's supposed to rain tonight.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3460","Lily","Or we could just stay home.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3461","Marshall","Maybe watch some TV.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3462","Lily","Order in some Chinese.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3463","Marshall","Oh, Sichuan Garden! Are we really bailing?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3464","Lily","Hell, yeah.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3465","Marshall","Good, cause this thing's empty.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3466","Barney","Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say ""wow.""","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3467","Robin","Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3468","Barney","It's one of the many risks of the blind approach. It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot. But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3469","Robin","Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3470","Barney","You can't just... Wow!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3471","Robin","Hey? What's taking so long? I have to go.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3472","Barney","Not so fast, Scherbotsky. I like the way you think. That mirror thing. Simple. Elegant. Okay, limited-time offer  I need a ""bro"" for my bro-ings on about town. How would you like to be said bro?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3473","Robin","Well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped. She really needs some support... or a stranger's tongue down her throat. That seems healthy. All right. Guess I'm in.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3474","Victoria","So... one more week and it'll be a month.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3475","Ted","Really? Are you sure? Wow, that snuck up on me.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3476","Victoria","Oh, come on.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3477","Ted","The 18th can't get here fast enough.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3478","Victoria","Wait, the 18th? Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this... I'm going to be out of town on the 18th!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3479","Ted","Oh. Well, um, we can just... wait until you get back. I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3480","Victoria","Yeah. Or we could do it tonight.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3481","Ted","75th and Amsterdam.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3482","Lily","I'm so glad we decided to just stay home.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3483","Marshall","Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone? We'd be just getting there now, all tired and cranky.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3484","Lily","And yet we'd feel obligated to have s*x.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3485","Marshall","Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it. I would like to propose a toast. To the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3486","Ted","I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3487","Victoria","I'm so glad your roommates are out of town.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3488","Lily","Oh, my God, what are they doing home?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3489","Marshall","They think we went away. Oh, it is on for my boy, Ted.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3490","Lily","But we didn't go away, we're in the bathroom.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3491","Marshall","They don't know that. All we have to do is hide out in here until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3492","Lily","But I don't want to hide out in here.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3493","Marshall","Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this. If we go out there and spoil the mood, it's not going to happen. Then one of us is going to have to have s*x with Ted, and... not going to be me.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3494","Lily","Okay, fine. I guess I'll actually floss.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3495","Barney","You suited up!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3496","Robin","Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3497","Barney","Emilio? The woman will have...","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3498","Robin","I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3499","Barney","Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. ""The Torpedo."" Or, as the rollers call it, ""Piramide.""","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3500","Robin","My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3501","Barney","Father issues. Hot.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3502","Robin","I know... I was this close to being a huge slut.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3503","Barney","Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3504","Robin","Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have s*x to get pregnant.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3505","Barney","What up! Freeze frame high five!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3506","Victoria","I think this may be a perfect moment. I wish we could hold onto it forever.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3507","Ted","No. Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting. By its very nature, it... slips through our fingers... making it that much more precious.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3508","Lily","Ugh, that is bad. That is, like, high-school-literary-magazine bad.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3509","Marshall","And they're not even high.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3510","Lily","It's actually working.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3511","Marshall","Yeah, smooth but slowly. God, close the deal, already. It's been, like, 45 minutes... we could have had s*x three times by now.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3512","Lily","Yeah, try five.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3513","Marshall","What up! Maybe we should just go out there.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3514","Lily","No way! We can't go out there now. They'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time. It'll be too weird.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3515","Marshall","Fine. But if we're stuck in here... I'm turning up the volume. Shh. Shh.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3516","Victoria","I want to know you. Like, know your soul. Ted, what makes you cry?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3517","Lily","Honey, could you hold my hair back, I think I'm going to hurl.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3518","Robin","So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3519","Barney","Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still...","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3520","Robin","What?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3521","Barney","There is one other thing we could do. If you're up for it.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3522","Robin","Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3523","Barney","Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3524","Robin","Oh, I believe it... this is awesome!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3525","Barney","Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3526","Robin","Thank me later. Let's keep moving. These little bastards are everywhere.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3527","Marshall","He's just staring into her eyes.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3528","Lily","I don't know, we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3529","Marshall","Yeah... now we just make fun of people like that. It's the circle of life.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3530","Lily","No, I'm serious, Marshall. I mean, we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip. And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3531","Marshall","Well, it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria. This is their first time.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3532","Lily","Yeah, but we could still have some more romance. Now, you just say, ""Want to do it?"" And I say, ""Yeah.""","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3533","Marshall","Want to...","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3534","Lily","No! Maybe we're just out of firsts.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3535","Marshall","Looks like they're about to have theirs.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3536","Ted","Should we take this to the bedroom?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3537","Marshall","Yes!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3538","Lily","Yes!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3539","Victoria","Yes.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3540","Marshall","Yes!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3541","Lily","Yes!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3542","Marshall","No. No, don't answer it!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3543","Victoria","You can answer it. We have all night.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3544","Marshall","You're answering it? He's answering it!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3545","Lily","No! Do her! Do her now!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3546","Ted","Sure. Good luck with that. (He hangs up) Sorry about that.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3547","Victoria","How about a little more wine?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3548","Ted","I'll get another bottle.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3549","Lily","I need a drink. Do we have any cough syrup in here?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3550","Marshall","Shh...","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3551","Robin","Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3552","Barney","No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3553","Robin","But I...","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3554","Barney","Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3555","Robin","See you on the other side.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3556","Barney","Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3557","Robin","Yeah.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3558","Barney","All right.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3559","Lily","Marshall, what happened to us? We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long. Have we lost that?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3560","Marshall","Maybe. But I think I just found it. Right here. Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering with just a hint of crazy eyes.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3561","Lily","Okay, well, get ready for my sex-ray vision. Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning? Oh, damn it.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3562","Marshall","It's all right. We can do this.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3563","Lily","Let's just hold hands. This is nice.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3564","Marshall","You love that move. It's a classic Marshall.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3565","Lily","All right, we totally suck at this. We really, really need to get out of here.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3566","Marshall","Well, we can't.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3567","Lily","Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you, it'll change the entire nature of our relationship.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3568","Marshall","What is it?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3569","Lily","I have to pee.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3570","Marshall","This is bad.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3571","Lily","Yeah.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3572","Marshall","We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other. You always think there'll be more time.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3573","Lily","Look at us. We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet. The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it, it might go out forever.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3574","Marshall","How much longer do you think you can hold it?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3575","Lily","I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3576","Marshall","Oh, boy.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3577","Robin","Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3578","Barney","Neither have I. Of course I cheat.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3579","Robin","Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3580","Barney","Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3581","Robin","Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3582","Barney","Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3583","Robin","That's a woman.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3584","Barney","Oh, my mistake. Or is it?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3585","Robin","Let's just focus on your target.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3586","Barney","Right.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3587","Robin","Yeah, I got this one. Oh, my God. I love your jeans.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3588","Woman","Okay. Is this a lesbian bar? Because that girl with the blue shirt just...","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3589","Robin","Oh, no. I am all about the dudes. Although pickings are pretty slim tonight. Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3590","Woman","Really? 'Cause he's totally vibing me right now. Must be the jeans.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3591","Robin","Well, jeans will only get you so far. I'm going home with him.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3592","Woman","We'll see about that.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3593","Lily","Oh, my God, I hate Ted. I hate him so much.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3594","Marshall","Baby, why don't you just go? Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3595","Lily","No, but we haven't, because I want to keep some of the mystery alive.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3596","Marshall","Well, you have farted in front of me.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3597","Lily","Yes, but I always cover it with a cough.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3598","Marshall","You always do.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3599","Barney","Hey.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3600","Robin","Hey.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3601","Barney","Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3602","Robin","What happened?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3603","Barney","Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3604","Robin","But why?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3605","Barney","Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3606","Robin","Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3607","Barney","Hit!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3608","Victoria","Ted, I can't wait any longer.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3609","Ted","Should we move to the bedroom?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3610","Victoria","There's no time for that.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3611","Marshall","They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour, but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3612","Lily","Baby, I can't hold it in any longer. It's time.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3613","Marshall","I know.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3614","Lily","I love you, Marshall.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3615","Marshall","I love you, Lily.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3616","Barney","Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3617","Robin","Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3618","Barney","Hard-core? That's the only way I play. (Barney strips down)","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3619","Robin","I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3620","Barney","I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3621","Robin","No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3622","Barney","Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3623","Robin","What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3624","Barney","You invited me up to your apartment to ""play Battleship."" Is that not an internationally recognized term for s*x?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3625","Robin","No.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3626","Barney","Great. I hope you're happy. You sunk my battleship.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3627","Lily","I'm okay. You okay?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3628","Marshall","I feel the same. And yet, strangely different.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3629","Lily","I'm happy for my bladder, yet sad for us.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3630","Marshall","You had to do it, sweetie... for Ted. And, hey, look, at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3631","Lily","Yeah. I guess our relationship had to take a hit so a new one out there could blossom. Oh, crap!","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3632","Marshall","They must have heard that.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3633","Lily","Well, I guess we can come out now. I don't believe it. They're gone.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3634","Marshall","Good. 'Cause I got to take a whiz.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3635","Robin","Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second...","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3636","Barney","But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3637","Robin","Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3638","Barney","I checked with Ted.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3639","Barney","Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well, I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right? I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin, you'd be cool with that, right?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3640","Ted","Sure. Good luck with that.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3641","Barney","Totally gave us his blessing.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3642","Robin","Really?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3643","Barney","Really.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3644","Robin","So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3645","Barney","Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh...","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3646","Robin","What?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3647","Barney","You like Ted.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3648","Robin","I didn't say I liked Ted.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3649","Barney","You like Ted. Wow. This is huge.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3650","Robin","Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for...","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3651","Barney","Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3652","Robin","You're not gonna tell him, are you?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3653","Barney","No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3654","Robin","A-7.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3655","Barney","Miss.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3656","Robin","Of course.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3657","Marshall","Well, we still have one frontier left. Still got the deuce.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3658","Lily","Not making me feel better.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3659","Marshall","Well, it certainly was a first.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3660","Lily","It was, wasn't it? We still have firsts.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3661","Marshall","Of course we do. And you know what, I actually feel closer to you now. I want to know you. Like, know your soul.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3662","Lily","Marshall, what makes you cry?","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3663","Marshall","This moment is fleeting because it's being chased by another moment.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3664","Lily","Oh, just grab my boob already.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3665","Ted","Come on, guys, get a room.","01","14","Zip, Zip, Zip"
"3666","Ted from 2030","Kids, something you might not know about your Uncle Marshall is that he's always been good at games. I mean, unbeatable. Gin! Yahtzee! Poker!","01","15","Game Night"
"3667","Ted","You don't have to shout out ""poker"" when you win.","01","15","Game Night"
"3668","Marshall","I know. It's just fun to say.","01","15","Game Night"
"3669","Ted from 2030","We all finally agreed Marshall should be running our game nights instead of playing in them. Which he took to mean, ""invent your own game.""","01","15","Game Night"
"3670","Marshall","It's called ""Marsh-gammon."" It combines all the best features of all the best games... Candy Land, I Never, Pictionary.","01","15","Game Night"
"3671","Robin","Backgammon, obviously.","01","15","Game Night"
"3672","Marshall","No. Backgammon sucks. I took the only good part of backgammon, the ""gammon,"" and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs.","01","15","Game Night"
"3673","Lily","I'm so excited Victoria's coming.","01","15","Game Night"
"3674","Robin","I'm going to go get another round.","01","15","Game Night"
"3675","Ted","Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight. Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot, so don't say anything embarrass... Don't say anything. And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin, so we you could just avoid the...","01","15","Game Night"
"3676","Barney","Well, well, well. How rich. You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend, yet, you have been lying to her since day one. Excuse me.Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on. So, nothing for him to stand on? Okay, and thanks so much. Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin? I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return.","01","15","Game Night"
"3677","Ted","No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that.","01","15","Game Night"
"3678","Lily","Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return?","01","15","Game Night"
"3679","Ted","Nothing. It's nothing. And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria?","01","15","Game Night"
"3680","Lily","Us? What would we do?","01","15","Game Night"
"3681","Ted","Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have and, in fact, moved here to get away from. However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight?","01","15","Game Night"
"3682","Marshall","Fine.","01","15","Game Night"
"3683","Lily","Fine.","01","15","Game Night"
"3684","Ted","Thank you.","01","15","Game Night"
"3685","Lily","I should go help Robin.","01","15","Game Night"
"3686","Robin","Hey.","01","15","Game Night"
"3687","Lily","Hey. So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight?","01","15","Game Night"
"3688","Robin","Oh, sure. She's great. Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted? No. Victoria's great. She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great. I said, ""She's great"" too many times, didn't I?","01","15","Game Night"
"3689","Lily","You must really hate the bitch.","01","15","Game Night"
"3690","Marshall","But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest, then you ""Marshall out,"" and all your chips go into the pot, and remember, if you ever ask the question ""What?"", then... you got to drink. Got it?","01","15","Game Night"
"3691","All","No","01","15","Game Night"
"3692","Marshall","Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just start, you guys'll pick it up. Newbie goes first. Roll.","01","15","Game Night"
"3693","Victoria","Okay.","01","15","Game Night"
"3694","Marshall","Three! You got Autobiography. Now, that's where you have to answer a personal question about your dating life truthfully in order to move on.","01","15","Game Night"
"3695","Ted","Marshall, come on.","01","15","Game Night"
"3696","Marshall","Hey, she's the one who rolled a three. Victoria, ""Have you ever cheated while in a relationship?"" Wow, good question.","01","15","Game Night"
"3697","Ted","You don't have to answer that.","01","15","Game Night"
"3698","Victoria","It's okay. Um, well, I was in a really crappy relationship in college, and I wound up kissing this guy at a party one night, and I felt terrible about it, so, I came clean, and we broke up.","01","15","Game Night"
"3699","Marshall","Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer. You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains.","01","15","Game Night"
"3700","Barney","So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?","01","15","Game Night"
"3701","Victoria","What?","01","15","Game Night"
"3702","Marshall","You said what, you got to drink!","01","15","Game Night"
"3703","Lily","Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd, and the host said she knew you. What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?","01","15","Game Night"
"3704","Barney","Shannon?! Shannon, Shannon... No, don't remember any Shannon.","01","15","Game Night"
"3705","Lily","Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give...","01","15","Game Night"
"3706","Barney","Where's the tape?","01","15","Game Night"
"3707","Lily","Fine. I'll go get it.","01","15","Game Night"
"3708","Barney","Cool, okay. You know, whenever.","01","15","Game Night"
"3709","Marshall","Okay, Robin, your roll. Five! Another Autobiography... for the player to your left, which... Victoria!","01","15","Game Night"
"3710","Ted","Of course.","01","15","Game Night"
"3711","Marshall","Victoria, ""How many boyfriends did you have before you started dating Ted?""","01","15","Game Night"
"3712","Ted","Wait, the card actually says ""Ted?""","01","15","Game Night"
"3713","Victoria","Okay, uh, well, boyfriends--I guess I've only had... two.","01","15","Game Night"
"3714","Robin","Prude alert.","01","15","Game Night"
"3715","Victoria","Well... that's serious boyfriends. I've dated other guys in between.","01","15","Game Night"
"3716","Robin","Oh, slut alert!","01","15","Game Night"
"3717","Barney","Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach. Oh, wow, look at that. Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me.","01","15","Game Night"
"3718","Marshall","Thank you! Finally somebody understands Marsh-gammon.","01","15","Game Night"
"3719","Lily","Barney, what was on that tape?","01","15","Game Night"
"3720","Barney","Too bad you'll never find out.","01","15","Game Night"
"3721","Lily","Oh, damn it! If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse. Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did.","01","15","Game Night"
"3722","Barney","What?!","01","15","Game Night"
"3723","Marshall","Drink!","01","15","Game Night"
"3724","Lily","Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead. So, should we pop it in?","01","15","Game Night"
"3725","Barney","Give it to me, give it, give me...","01","15","Game Night"
"3726","Ted","Play the tape, play it, play it!","01","15","Game Night"
"3727","Barney","Ted! Fine, fine. You cannot play it. Shannon! I love you! I love you so much. What about us changing the world together? Don't tell me you've forgotten. I know I haven't. Will I ever see another rainbow? Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe? Baby, please Don't go There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love There's a thief in the palace and she's...","01","15","Game Night"
"3728","Marshall","Did you try his cell phone?","01","15","Game Night"
"3729","Ted","Yeah, I left two messages. I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard. He's off the grid.","01","15","Game Night"
"3730","Barney","Hey, guys, what up?","01","15","Game Night"
"3731","Robin","Barney, where have you been?","01","15","Game Night"
"3732","Ted","Yeah, we're-we're really sorry about that.","01","15","Game Night"
"3733","Lily","Yeah, so sorry. But seriously, what was up with the tape? No, no, stay.","01","15","Game Night"
"3734","All","Come on. Stay!","01","15","Game Night"
"3735","Barney","I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it. It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me.","01","15","Game Night"
"3736","Marshall","Well, we all have embarrassing stories. Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it.","01","15","Game Night"
"3737","Barney","Oh, really? Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall? Show me how good it is.","01","15","Game Night"
"3738","Marshall","All right.","01","15","Game Night"
"3739","Marshall","I was stopping by Lily's kindergarten class to say hi, but they were all at recess. I really had to pee, so I went into the class's restroom. It was a-a smaller target than I'm used to, so I figured I should sit down. What I didn't realize was, it was a shared bathroom. I wish I'd pulled up my pants.","01","15","Game Night"
"3740","Lily","The kids still call him Funny Butt.","01","15","Game Night"
"3741","Barney","Okay. I'll tell you my story. Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today.","01","15","Game Night"
"3742","Barney","It was 1998. I was just out of college, and I was working at a coffeehouse with my girlfriend. My girlfriend... *Shannon. Yeah, you were meant for me And I was meant for you. Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.* Thank you. All right.","01","15","Game Night"
"3743","Shannon","I love your singing, Barney.","01","15","Game Night"
"3744","Barney","And I love you, Shannon.","01","15","Game Night"
"3745","Shannon","Joining the Peace Corps with you is gonna be legendary.","01","15","Game Night"
"3746","Barney","I know. Only five short weeks till we're down in Nicaragua.","01","15","Game Night"
"3747","Man","Hey, nonfat latte to go.","01","15","Game Night"
"3748","Barney","Mellow order, bro, mellow order.","01","15","Game Night"
"3749","Man","Dude, that your g-friend? All right, high five!","01","15","Game Night"
"3750","Barney","Sorry, I only give high twos.","01","15","Game Night"
"3751","Man","Whatevs. As long as you're nailing that.","01","15","Game Night"
"3752","Barney","Listen to you. That? You know, women aren't objects. They're human beings. And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we're married. You can read about it in my zine.","01","15","Game Night"
"3753","Man","Hey, haircut, right here. Open up your knowledge basket, 'cause here it comes. Forget that touchy-feely crap. You get money, you get laid. End of discussion.","01","15","Game Night"
"3754","Barney","I feel sorry for you, man.","01","15","Game Night"
"3755","Man","Peace out, hombre.","01","15","Game Night"
"3756","Barney","Suits. Five weeks later, we were all set to leave for the Peace Corps. Only problem was... she never showed up.","01","15","Game Night"
"3757","Robin","She never showed?","01","15","Game Night"
"3758","Ted","So, what happened next?","01","15","Game Night"
"3759","Barney","You know what? This was a mistake.","01","15","Game Night"
"3760","Lily","Wait... What if somebody else told their most humiliating story?","01","15","Game Night"
"3761","Marshall","Oh, I know just how to decide who.","01","15","Game Night"
"3762","Lily","You brought the game to the bar?","01","15","Game Night"
"3763","Marshall","Well, we're not quitting just 'cause Ted's so far ahead.","01","15","Game Night"
"3764","Ted","I was winning?","01","15","Game Night"
"3765","Robin","Fine. I'll go next.","01","15","Game Night"
"3766","Robin","I was doing a report on live TV about a hansom cab driver.","01","15","Game Night"
"3767","Barney","Not the slipping-in-horse-poop story!","01","15","Game Night"
"3768","Ted","Yeah, we all know that one.","01","15","Game Night"
"3769","Victoria","Okay, how about this? I will tell you my most humiliating story.","01","15","Game Night"
"3770","Marshall","Yeah, Victoria, way to step up!","01","15","Game Night"
"3771","Victoria","Okay, it involves a game of truth or dare, a squeeze-bottle of marshmallow ice cream topping, and the hot tub at my grandparents' retirement community.","01","15","Game Night"
"3772","Ted from 2030","Kids, I tell you a lot of inappropriate stories, but there's no way in hell I'm telling you this one. Don't worry, though, it wasn't that great.","01","15","Game Night"
"3773","Marshall","That is the greatest story ever!","01","15","Game Night"
"3774","Lily","Oh my God!","01","15","Game Night"
"3775","Ted","Wow, wow!","01","15","Game Night"
"3776","Barney","Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy. My saga... continues.","01","15","Game Night"
"3777","Barney","I went back to the coffeehouse to find Shannon.","01","15","Game Night"
"3778","Shannon","Barney.","01","15","Game Night"
"3779","Barney","Sugar Bear, where were you?","01","15","Game Night"
"3780","Shannon","Oh, I'm sorry. My dad won't let me go.","01","15","Game Night"
"3781","Barney","But the Nicaraguans need us!","01","15","Game Night"
"3782","Shannon","It's just, he's still supporting me, and... Look, he's coming by soon to talk about it, but I think you should go on without me.","01","15","Game Night"
"3783","Barney","Shannon, there is no...","01","15","Game Night"
"3784","Shannon","Barney, it's your dream. It's only two years. I know we can make it.","01","15","Game Night"
"3785","Barney","As I walked away, I realized Shannon was an adult. Her father couldn't control her life. I had to go back and confront him. She was in the middle of a heated argument with her dad.","01","15","Game Night"
"3786","Marshall","Now we all got to drink.","01","15","Game Night"
"3787","Ted","Oh, my God. What happened next?","01","15","Game Night"
"3788","Barney","I don't know, guys.","01","15","Game Night"
"3789","Lily","Okay, okay. Marshall's mom sent us cookies...","01","15","Game Night"
"3790","Marshall","Lily, no!","01","15","Game Night"
"3791","Lily","For the team, Marshall, for the team.","01","15","Game Night"
"3792","Lily","Hey, Mrs. Eriksen, it's Lily. Thank you so much for the delicious cookies. Mayonnaise. Really? Never would have guessed. Well, I will definitely give Marshall a kiss for you. Okay. Take care.","01","15","Game Night"
"3793","Marshall","Oh, crap. My mom sent cookies?","01","15","Game Night"
"3794","Lily","Yeah. I wish we had a dog, so they wouldn't go to waste.","01","15","Game Night"
"3795","Marshall","So we've got the whole place to ourselves.","01","15","Game Night"
"3796","Lily","I'm thinking floor s*x.","01","15","Game Night"
"3797","Marshall","Sounds reasonable.","01","15","Game Night"
"3798","Lily","Ooh, floor's cold. Grab that afghan your mom made.","01","15","Game Night"
"3799","Robin","The whole time?","01","15","Game Night"
"3800","Lily","The... whole... time.","01","15","Game Night"
"3801","Marshall","Barney, that was really embarrassing for both of us. We just earned a huge chunk of story.","01","15","Game Night"
"3802","Barney","Right. So where was I? Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad.","01","15","Game Night"
"3803","Barney","How can... With your dad? I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!","01","15","Game Night"
"3804","Shannon","Barney, that's not my dad. His name's Greg. I've been seeing him for a few weeks. I was hoping you'd just leave, and we could avoid all this.","01","15","Game Night"
"3805","Barney","We're breaking up? But what about the Peace Corps?","01","15","Game Night"
"3806","Shannon","Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase. Greg's older. He's successful. He buys me all this cool stuff.","01","15","Game Night"
"3807","Barney","But I love you.","01","15","Game Night"
"3808","Shannon","But he has a boat. You should go to the Peace Corps and forget about me.","01","15","Game Night"
"3809","Barney","I didn't go. That night, I recorded my video and mailed it to Shannon. I didn't see her until a week later. There's sugar in the basket. Shannon! Shannon, you came back!","01","15","Game Night"
"3810","Shannon","I'm just picking up my last paycheck.","01","15","Game Night"
"3811","Barney","Oh. Did you... did you get my tape?","01","15","Game Night"
"3812","Man","Oh, she got the tape.","01","15","Game Night"
"3813","Barney","You? It was you?","01","15","Game Night"
"3814","Man","Will I ever see another rainbow Oh, man.","01","15","Game Night"
"3815","Lily","Oh, you poor thing.","01","15","Game Night"
"3816","Barney","The story's not over. I did see Shannon one more time.","01","15","Game Night"
"3817","Robin","When?","01","15","Game Night"
"3818","Marshall","Sorry.","01","15","Game Night"
"3819","Lily","You've got to tell us.","01","15","Game Night"
"3820","Barney","I don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it.","01","15","Game Night"
"3821","Ted","Fine. Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...","01","15","Game Night"
"3822","Barney","Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear. Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth. Why can't you?","01","15","Game Night"
"3823","Ted","You're right. Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet, but a while back, I was kind of into Robin. In fact, on our first date, I might have said, ""I love you."" Understandably, she freaked out and I left. But unfortunately, the night did not end there.","01","15","Game Night"
"3824","Ted","We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit.","01","15","Game Night"
"3825","Ranjit","To one hell of a night!","01","15","Game Night"
"3826","Ted","And I drank... a lot. So you guys think I should have kissed her? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now.","01","15","Game Night"
"3827","Barney","Yes! Do it!","01","15","Game Night"
"3828","Ranjit","To the cab.","01","15","Game Night"
"3829","Robin","Hello? Is someone out there?","01","15","Game Night"
"3830","Lily","You ralphed and ran?","01","15","Game Night"
"3831","Marshall","I thought you were vomit-free since '93. So that was a lie?","01","15","Game Night"
"3832","Robin","You re-returned for me. That's really sweet. Though you kind of ruined my customized Scherbotsky doormat.","01","15","Game Night"
"3833","Ted","Sorry.","01","15","Game Night"
"3834","Robin","It's okay.","01","15","Game Night"
"3835","Ted","Victoria, I know this must be...","01","15","Game Night"
"3836","Victoria","Yeah. It kind of is.","01","15","Game Night"
"3837","Barney","Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story. But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine. We fast-forward eight years into the future.","01","15","Game Night"
"3838","Marshall","Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year.","01","15","Game Night"
"3839","Barney","Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight.","01","15","Game Night"
"3840","Barney","Hi.","01","15","Game Night"
"3841","Shannon","Barney?","01","15","Game Night"
"3842","Barney","Hi, Shannon.","01","15","Game Night"
"3843","Shannon","What are you doing here?","01","15","Game Night"
"3844","Barney","Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life.","01","15","Game Night"
"3845","Barney","She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker  Shannon's a mom. She has a little kid named Max. That's crazy. That could have been my kid. But instead, what do I have? My whole life's some money in the bank, some suits in my closet and a string of one-night stands.","01","15","Game Night"
"3846","Lily","Hey. Come on. I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another, it doesn't make your life any worse.","01","15","Game Night"
"3847","Barney","My life rocks! Money, suits and s*x. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.","01","15","Game Night"
"3848","Lily","Nope.","01","15","Game Night"
"3849","Barney","Yeah.","01","15","Game Night"
"3850","Lily","Nope.","01","15","Game Night"
"3851","Barney","Yeah.","01","15","Game Night"
"3852","Lily","Sorry. Don't buy it. You're making it up. You're just trying to cover the fact that you actually had a profound moment of doubt about yourself and... Oh, my God.","01","15","Game Night"
"3853","Shannon","Oh, Barney!","01","15","Game Night"
"3854","Barney","Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?","01","15","Game Night"
"3855","Shannon","Is your phone on?","01","15","Game Night"
"3856","Barney","Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down.","01","15","Game Night"
"3857","Lily","Ew, gross. Just stop it.","01","15","Game Night"
"3858","Barney","Ladies, gentlemen... Ted. This has been a wonderful evening. I got great dirt on all you guys. I got Ted to tell the re-return. I finally nailed Shannon! Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right. And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is. Peace out, hombres!","01","15","Game Night"
"3859","Marshall","I think Barney just won game night.","01","15","Game Night"
"3860","Ted from 2030","We spend so much effort trying to keep parts of our lives hidden even from our closest friends. But those rare times when we do open up, it's amazing how minor those secrets all end up seeming. Of course, not every secret was told that night. But that's getting ahead of the story.","01","15","Game Night"
"3861","Ted from 2030","Kids, when it comes to love, the best relationships are the ones that just come naturally.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3862","Ted","My first solo batch.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3863","Victoria","Um, I think those need to stay in the oven a while longer. Here's a professional tip. If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake. It's a beverage.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3864","Ted from 2030","Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun, and easy, and uncomplicated. It was pretty great.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3865","Barney","Um, are you coloring in your butt?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3866","Marshall","I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3867","Barney","So wear another one.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3868","Marshall","I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3869","Barney","Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3870","Marshall","Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3871","Barney","Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3872","Marshall","A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3873","Barney","Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks ""suit."" Tomorrow, noon, my tailor.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3874","Marshall","No thanks, dude. (Barney grabs Marshall's pants and tears them apart) Noon?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3875","Barney","Noon. See you then.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3876","Victoria","Hey, girls.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3877","Robin and Lily","Hey.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3878","Victoria","Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted. It's our two monthiversary, so we're going out to dinner.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3879","Robin","Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3880","Lily","Robin!","01","16","Cupcake"
"3881","Robin","Oh, come on. We bust on each other. We're just at that place in our strong friendship.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3882","Victoria","Really? Oh.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3883","Robin","Get off me. Oh, see? I did it again.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3884","Victoria","What are you guys up to? Oh, dress shopping. You know, I make wedding cakes for a lot of fancy bridal shops. If you want, I could take you shopping, maybe get you a discount.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3885","Lily","Really? That'd be great.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3886","Victoria","Yeah. Huh. I should take this. Hello.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3887","Robin","Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3888","Lily","Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3889","Robin","The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3890","Lily","Sold. Victoria, what's wrong?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3891","Victoria","I've just been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3892","Ted","Wait. Germany, Europe?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3893","Victoria","It's for two years. I figured I didn't have much of a chance, 'cause they don't let many Americans in, but... I'm in.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3894","Ted","So, this is the Europe Germany?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3895","Victoria","What other Germany would it be?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3896","Ted","The one in Epcot?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3897","Victoria","Ted.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3898","Ted","Sorry. Congratulations.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3899","Victoria","Thank you. I don't know if I'm going to go.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3900","Ted","Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3901","Victoria","I don't know. I just... I don't think that long distance really works for anyone.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3902","Ted","Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3903","Victoria","So, that leaves us with...","01","16","Cupcake"
"3904","Ted","Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel...","01","16","Cupcake"
"3905","Victoria","I have to leave on Monday.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3906","Ted","Monday, September the...?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3907","Victoria","Ted. Do you have any thoughts?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3908","Ted","Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want. We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3909","Victoria","It's a date.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3910","Ted from 2030","And that's when things got complicated.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3911","Marshall","Hey, baby, how's the dress place?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3912","Lily","Everything's so fluffy and white. It's like shopping in a marshmallow. How's Barney's tailor?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3913","Marshall","Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3914","Lily","Well, good luck, baby.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3915","Marshall","Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3916","Barney","Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3917","Marshall","You speak Ukrainian?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3918","Ted","Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3919","Marshall","No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no s*x. Kill me now.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3920","Barney","Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3921","Ted","Really? You?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3922","Barney","Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3923","Marshall","Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3924","Ted","Yeah.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3925","Marshall","Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, ""You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face."" Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3926","Ted","Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3927","Marshall","Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost killed us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3928","Ted","Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3929","Marshall","Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3930","Ted","Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3931","Barney","Are you sure?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3932","Ted","All right. (He calls Victoria)","01","16","Cupcake"
"3933","Victoria","Hello.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3934","Ted","Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3935","Victoria","Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3936","Ted","Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye. (He hungs up) She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3937","Barney","Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3938","Marshall","Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3939","Barney","Here. Play with this pin cushion.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3940","Marshall","God. I'm going to look hot.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3941","Barney","Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3942","Marshall","No way. The Kid does not sell out.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3943","Barney","Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3944","Marshall","No. I've made my decision.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3945","Ted","So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3946","Ted from 2030","And so I met her that night to tell her my decision.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3947","Victoria","All right, I've been thinking a lot about this... Okay, wait, before you say anything, I wanted to give you this. This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3948","Ted","I want you to stay.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3949","Marshall","Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3950","Lily","Oh, good luck, baby.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3951","Marshall","Bye.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3952","Woman","Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3953","Lily","Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3954","Robin","I saw a couple up front that were nice.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3955","Lily","Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3956","Victoria","Oh, these women are experts. They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3957","Lily","Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!","01","16","Cupcake"
"3958","Victoria","At least we get free champagne!","01","16","Cupcake"
"3959","Robin","And cake.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3960","Victoria","Mm-hmm.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3961","Robin","Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3962","Victoria","You know, I don't know. I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted. I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3963","Lily","Ugh. All talking and no s*x. Kill me now.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3964","Victoria","I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One. That's pretty hard to walk away from.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3965","Robin","Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3966","Victoria","But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted. He's amazing. He's the best guy I know.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3967","Robin","Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3968","Victoria","I really don't...","01","16","Cupcake"
"3969","Robin","s*x. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This b*st*rd's kicked.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3970","Woman","Thanks.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3971","Victoria and Robin","Oh!","01","16","Cupcake"
"3972","Lily","It's okay, guys, I hate it.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3973","Victoria","Just horrible.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3974","Robin","It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3975","Lily","You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3976","Victoria","But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates? It's too soon. Ooh. Speak of the devil. Hello.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3977","Ted","Hey, random question  how do you feel cats?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3978","Victoria","Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3979","Robin","A cat person. Why am I not surprised?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3980","Victoria","Bye. Why does Ted want to know if I like cats?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3981","Lily","Maybe he's going to buy you one.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3982","Victoria","I did hear barking in the background. Maybe he was in a pet store. Does he want us to get a cat together?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3983","Robin","Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3984","Victoria","That is low. Do you really think that's what he's doing?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3985","Robin","Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3986","Victoria and Robin","Aw.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3987","Lily","Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3988","Robin","Ugly, ugly, ugly.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3989","Victoria","I don't know what to say. You know what? We're doing this all wrong. I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3990","Lily","Are you okay?","01","16","Cupcake"
"3991","Robin","I'm fine.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3992","Lily","Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3993","Robin","I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3994","Lily","Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3995","Victoria","Somebody say ""beautiful princess.""","01","16","Cupcake"
"3996","Lily","Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3997","Victoria","Oh, look how happy she is. You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women who would never let any guy mess with my career. And now I'm actually thinking about it. I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3998","Robin","I know what you mean.","01","16","Cupcake"
"3999","Victoria","You do?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4000","Lily","Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4001","Victoria","See, that's what I'm afraid of.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4002","Robin","Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4003","Victoria","Robin... I think that you are the coolest. I'm so glad that we're friends.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4004","Robin","Oh, no way... you're the coolest.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4005","Victoria","No, you are.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4006","Robin","Okay, I am.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4007","Victoria","I'm going to stay.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4008","Victoria and Robin","Aw.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4009","Lily","Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4010","Robin","Wow, you look incredible.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4011","Lily","Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4012","Robin","Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4013","Lily","Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married. (She sits on the cake, without noticing it) Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4014","Robin","Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4015","Victoria","But, you know what? It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4016","Robin","Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4017","Lily","It was like this when I found it?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4018","Woman","And how will you be paying for this?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4019","Lily","Credit card... s.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4020","Victoria","I wanted to give you... this. This is what happens when you... you know, let them finish baking.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4021","Ted","I want you to stay.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4022","Victoria","I have to go to Germany.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4023","Ted","You're going?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4024","Victoria","Yes. I have to.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4025","Ted","So that's what you decided?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4026","Victoria","Well, no... I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying, but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4027","Ted","What is this, opposite day or something?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4028","Victoria","No.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4029","Ted","So it is?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4030","Victoria","Ted, we've only been dating for two months. I can't let you make this decision for me.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4031","Ted","I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4032","Victoria","Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4033","Ted","Well, that's just crazy.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4034","Victoria","Oh, okay. So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4035","Ted","But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4036","Victoria","You'd have me.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4037","Ted","We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4038","Victoria","So... we're breaking up?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4039","Ted","I guess so. I guess so.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4040","Marshall","God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4041","Ted","It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4042","Marshall","Well, thank you for acknowledging it. It was weird that you hadn't. Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4043","Ted","She's leaving tomorrow.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4044","Marshall","Yeah, but she's still in town.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4045","Ted","Yeah, she... she's still in town.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4046","Marshall","Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together. Ted, think about it this way  if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow, would you sit on the couch and cry about it, or would you run, and jump, and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4047","Ted","Awesome air kicks, huh?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4048","Marshall","New pajama bottoms?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4049","Ted","You know it.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4050","Ted","So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4051","Victoria","Wait, so we're sharing the leg?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4052","Ted","No, the leg is a metaphor.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4053","Victoria","How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day, and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next? I don't know, Ted.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4054","Ted","Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4055","Victoria","Well, what would you want to do?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4056","Ted","Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4057","Victoria","Like go to the Mets.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4058","Ted","Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4059","Victoria","See some monkeys at the zoo?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4060","Ted","Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4061","Victoria","Wow! We better get going.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4062","Ted","Yeah, big day.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4063","Victoria","Yeah.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4064","Ted from 2030","And, kids, that's exactly what we did with our last day. The museum, the bridge, the restaurant, and all of those nice things.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4065","Robin","Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4066","Lily","No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4067","Robin","Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4068","Lily","Yeah, but only, like, second base.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4069","Barney","Look at us  two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4070","Marshall","Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4071","Barney","So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4072","Marshall","Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4073","Barney","Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4074","Marshall","B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4075","Barney","Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4076","Marshall","You set this up! You set this whole thing up!","01","16","Cupcake"
"4077","Barney","I most certainly did...","01","16","Cupcake"
"4078","Marshall","Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4079","Lily","I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4080","Marshall","What time is the interview?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4081","Barney","9 00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes. Don't worry, I know a guy.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4082","Victoria","I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4083","Ted","Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the s*x.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4084","Victoria","I'm going to miss you so much.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4085","Ted","I'm going to miss you, too.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4086","Victoria","Hey, you know, I mean, if, when I get back, we're still single, we can...","01","16","Cupcake"
"4087","Ted","Even if we're not.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4088","Victoria","Okay.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4089","Ted","Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?","01","16","Cupcake"
"4090","Victoria","Yes. Yes!","01","16","Cupcake"
"4091","Ted","We can beat the odds.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4092","Victoria","Odds, schmodds.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4093","Ted","It's gonna work. We're going to make it work-- it'll work.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4094","Ted from 2030","It didn't work. Long-distance was and is a terrible idea, a really terrible idea, just awful. But more on that later.","01","16","Cupcake"
"4095","Ted from 2030","When your Uncle Marshall was ten years old, he read a book called Life Among the Gorillas. It was written by an anthropologist named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez, it told the story of the year she spent living among the Western Lowland Gorillas of Cameroon. When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez came to the local community college to give a lecture, Marshall, the youngest member of the audience, raised his hand with a question.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4096","Marshall","What advice do you have for a budding anthropologist?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4097","Dr. Birnholz","So you want to be an anthropologist?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4098","Marshall","Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live with the gorillas, just like you did.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4099","Ted from 2030","What she said next changed his life.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4100","Dr. Birnholz","Oh, that's wonderful, but I'm afraid you can't. They'll all be dead by then...","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4101","Marshall","...and if economic sanctions and trade restrictions aren't enforced, the destruction of the rainforests will continue and over a million species will be wiped out.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4102","Ted","So you don't want coffee.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4103","Marshall","I'm saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible...","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4104","Ted","All right. I'm pouring it out.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4105","Marshall","Okay, one cup. The kid needs to be alert. First day on the job and everything.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4106","Ted","I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us. ""The kid"" has become ""the man.""","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4107","Marshall","Okay, it's just an internship to make a little money. After law school, I'm going to work for the NRDC. They're gonna stop global warming.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4108","Ted from 2030","Well... I mean... they did their best.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4109","Lily","Here's your sack lunch.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4110","Marshall","Okay, I love you because, one, you made me a sack lunch and two, you laugh every time you say the word ""sack"".","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4111","Lily","I love you, Marshmallow.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4112","Marshall","I love you.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4113","Ted","I love you too, Marshmallow.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4114","Marshall","Uh-oh. Ted?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4115","Ted","Oh, no. No, she didn't.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4116","Marshall","Yeah. Yeah, she did.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4117","Ted","Another care package?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4118","Ted from 2030","Another care package. I'd been in a long-distance relationship with Victoria for nearly a month. Long-distance relationships are a bad idea.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4119","Marshall","How many is that so far?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4120","Ted","Three.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4121","Lily","And how many have you sent her?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4122","Ted","In the mail or in my mind? Zero. She's up three-zip. Oh! Cupcakes! Great. I bet they're delicious, too. Yup, they're delicious. Damn it! I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes. God, I hate myself right now.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4123","Marshall","God, that is so me at 15.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4124","Ted from 2030","Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel. Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls. I mean, this was a huge company, so they did other things... But mostly they wanted the public to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff. Anyway, Marshall managed to score an internship in their legal department because he knew someone who worked there.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4125","Barney","Go for Barney.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4126","Voice","Mr. Stinson, this is Willis from lobby security. Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports of a sasquatch loose in the building.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4127","Barney","A sasquatch?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4128","Voice","That's right, sir, a Bigfoot. We don't want to alarm you, but he's been spotted on your floor.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4129","Barney","Yes! Look at you. You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4130","Marshall","Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4131","Barney","Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all  Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness...","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4132","Marshall","There's one for awesomeness?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4133","Barney","Yeah, I had it made. Sit.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4134","Marshall","Hey, so, now that I'm working here, are you finally going to tell me exactly what your job is?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4135","Barney","Please.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4136","Man #1","My dawg!","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4137","Man #2","My dawg!","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4138","Barney","Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall. These guys are in legal. You're gonna be working with them.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4139","Marshall","Marshall Eriksen. Nice to meet you.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4140","Bilson","Nice tie. Steak sauce.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4141","Blauman","Oh, steak sauce! For true, though.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4142","Marshall","Where, I don't, I don't see...","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4143","Barney","Marshall? Sidebar. Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4144","Bilson","Okay, Eriksen, let's get to work. It's 2 00 a.m. It's raining outside. Ding dong! What? The doorbell? Oh, hello, Jessica Alba in a trench coat and nothing else. But wait-- knock, knock. Somebody's at the back door?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4145","Marshall","I don't have a back door.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4146","Bilson","Oh, my gosh, Jessica Simpson? What a surprise. Two Jessicas, you gotta pick one. What do you do? Go.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4147","Marshall","Right. Well, uh... I'm engaged, so--","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4148","Bilson","Fiancee's out of town. What do you do? Go.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4149","Marshall","We're still engaged, even if she's...","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4150","Bilson","Okay, fiancee's dead. Hit by a bus. What do you do? Go.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4151","Ted","Sure you don't want one?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4152","Robin","How many of those have you eaten?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4153","Ted","Four. Teen. No, just four. And the icing from two more. So, anyway, here's the problem.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4154","Ted","Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep. Anyway, I got the care package, and it's just great. Here, listen... Mmm. Mmm!","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4155","Ted","So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake... And... I said something dumb.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4156","Ted","Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail. I sent it a couple days ago. And it's awesome. Really, really awesome.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4157","Ted","Why did I say that? I think frosting makes me lie.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4158","Robin","Oh, Teddy boy.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4159","Ted","Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her. So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4160","Robin","All right, here's what you do  Put together a care package of stuff from New York-- some H&H bagels, an Empire State Building keychain... and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready? From three days ago.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4161","Ted","That's brilliant. You're brilliant. You know, it's funny, not so long ago, I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4162","Robin","That is funny.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4163","Ted from 2030","And here's why it was funny.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4164","Ted from 2030","Little did I realize, a few weeks earlier, here's what Robin was saying to Lily about me.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4165","Robin","Okay, fine, I have feelings for him.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4166","Ted","Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4167","Robin","The irony is clear, Ted.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4168","Lily","Hey! How was your first day?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4169","Marshall","I don't wanna talk about it. The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4170","Lily","What?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4171","Marshall","They're jerks!","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4172","Lily","What makes them jerks?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4173","Marshall","Forget it, I don't want to talk about it. Well, like today at lunch..","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4174","Bilson","What do you got there, Ericksen? Mommy pack your lunch?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4175","Marshall","For your information, my fiancee did.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4176","Blauman","Oh... Does she cut the crusts off your sandwich, too?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4177","Marshall","No.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4178","Blauman","What's that?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4179","Marshall","Nothing. Give it.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4180","Bilson","""Dear Marshmallow. Good luck today. I love you. Lilypad.""","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4181","Marshall","Give it.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4182","Bilson","P.S. If you've unfolded this note, your kiss already got out. Quick-- catch it.""","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4183","Marshall","Give it back. Hey, give it. Gimme... Give it!","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4184","Lily","Oh, screw those guys! We're adorable.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4185","Marshall","I know. God. It's like freshman year all over again. Only this time, my sweet dance moves aren't going to be enough to win them over. Not even Old Reliable.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4186","Lily","Sweetie... It would be cool to have some extra money, but, but, if you're unhappy, it's not worth it.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4187","Marshall","I quit.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4188","Barney","What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4189","Marshall","We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4190","Barney","Please.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4191","Marshall","I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4192","Barney","Oh, of course it's not for you. It's for Lily.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4193","Marshall","What?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4194","Barney","Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4195","Marshall","The package?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4196","Barney","The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4197","Marshall","Lily doesn't care about that stuff.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4198","Barney","Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4199","Marshall","She'll be happy.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4200","Barney","Okay. But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4201","Bilson","And all four are totally naked. You gotta choose one. What do you do? Go.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4202","Marshall","I guess, uh... Bea Arthur.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4203","Bilson","Ahh! Wrong! Betty White. Clean this stuff up, Eriksen.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4204","Robin","So, did she get the awesome care package yet?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4205","Ted","Yep. Yesterday.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4206","Robin","Did she love it?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4207","Ted","Ooh, she loved it.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4208","Robin","So what's the problem?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4209","Ted","So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you, we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half. Eventually you just run out of stuff to say.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4210","Ted","What did you have for lunch today? Oh. Rye bread. Yeah.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4211","Robin","Oh, Teddy boy.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4212","Ted","I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch. Maybe it just can't be do. I think it's clear what I have to do.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4213","Robin","It's pretty clear.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4214","Ted","I have to go to Germany and surprise her.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4215","Robin","Totally what I was thinking. Get out of my head, man!","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4216","Marshall","Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4217","Barney","Marshall, consider the penguins.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4218","Marshall","The penguins?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4219","Barney","On the wall.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4220","Marshall","""Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold."" This is a motivational poster?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4221","Barney","Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy. And you know why? Because you're different. Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are, or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4222","Lily","Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4223","Marshall","Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled, but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas. I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them. It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4224","Lily","It sounds kinda like peer pressure.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4225","Marshall","No, no, no. It's totally anthropological and it's cool and I'm doing it.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4226","Lily","Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure. We have an assembly every year.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4227","Marshall","I'm portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4228","Lily","All right, but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke, what do you say?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4229","Marshall","Only when I'm drunk.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4230","Lily","Good boy.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4231","Ted from 2030","And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla, and that meant gorilla lessons.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4232","Barney","Okay, I'm psyched about this. But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4233","Marshall","Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4234","Barney","Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it. Show it.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4235","Marshall","I'm psyched!","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4236","Barney","What was that? Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure. That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4237","Marshall","Wow, that was really specific.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4238","Barney","Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt!","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4239","Marshall","So badly.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4240","Barney","And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4241","Marshall","Right. Get what done?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4242","Barney","Whatever.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4243","Marshall","Cool. And what guy is this?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4244","Barney","There's always a guy.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4245","Marshall","Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4246","Barney","You sure? You want to practice your story one more time?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4247","Marshall","All right. So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa, and they're all, ""Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs."" So I'm, like, ""Snapadoo!"" So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport......and that is when the bouncer kicked us out. Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, but dudes, fake diamond ring? Worth every penny, bruh.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4248","Blauman","Eriksen...that was steak sauce!","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4249","Bilson","Great story.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4250","Ted from 2030","The next moning, I was about to buy my ticket to Germany when I got an e-mail.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4251","Ted","Uh-oh.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4252","Victoria's voice","""Hey, Ted, sorry I missed your call last night. This long-distance thing sucks, huh? Listen, I've been thinking and I really need to talk to you tonight. I'll call you at 11 00. Victoria."" So?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4253","Ted","So she's going to dump me. Has anyone ever said, ""Listen, I've been thinking,"" and then follow it up with something good? It's not like  Listen, I've been thinking, Nutter-Butters are an underrated cookie. What else can it be? What could she possibly have to say to me that she couldn't write in an e-mail?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4254","Robin","I cut off all my fingers? Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it. I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident. I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4255","Ted","Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy. So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4256","Robin","I'd wait.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4257","Marshall","'Sup, Blauman? E-bomb here. We still on for karaoke? Dope. I'm going to rock you on the mike so hard your hears are going to bleed gravy. Catch you on the flip, butt puppet.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4258","Lily","Okay...what do you think?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4259","Marshall","Steak sauce.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4260","Lily","Steak sauce?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4261","Marshall","Yeah.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4262","Lily","Look, you know, whatever anthropology you do at work is your business, but please don't act like that around here.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4263","Marshall","Lily, when Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-...","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4264","Lily","No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline came home from the gorillas, she didn't run around picking nits out of people's hair and-and throwing feces. I'm begging you just, just leave it at the office.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4265","Marshall","Why?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4266","Lily","Because you're acting like one of those guys, and those guys are lame.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4267","Marshall","Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes, but they're actually good guys, and if you got to know them, then you would see that. Come karaoke with us tonight, and you'll see how totally not that lame they are, okay?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4268","Lily","Okay.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4269","Blauman","But wait, knock-knock, back door, who's there? Angelina Jolie... wait, in a wheelchair. What do you do? Go.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4270","Bilson","Dude, Scarlett Johannsen with no arms, any day of the week. Yeah.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4271","Lily","You're right. They're delightful.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4272","Marshall","So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4273","Barney","Nah. I'm so over karaoke.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4274","Marshall","Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4275","Barney","Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really. But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4276","Lily","Oh, baby, they have our song. Let's do ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart.""","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4277","Bilson","What?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4278","Marshall","""Don't Go Breaking My Heart."" Elton John, Kiki Dee.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4279","Bilson","No way. You got to go with some Black Sabbath.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4280","Lily","Well, actually, Marshall and I have this little dance routine.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4281","Marshall","""Iron Man."" I could do ""Iron Man.""","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4282","Blauman","Steak sauce.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4283","Bilson","Steak sauce, dude.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4284","Blauman","Should we tell him? All right, Eriksen, I've got some good news. On Monday, Bilson and I are going to talk to Montague in HR. When you graduate, we want you working with us. What do you say? Yes!","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4285","Bilson","That's my man!","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4286","Blauman","I told you he would. Aw, we're gonna own the office.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4287","Lily","Okay, that was gross. When were you going to tell me you changed your entire career path?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4288","Marshall","Nothing has changed, okay? I still want to help the environment. I just thought that maybe I could make some money for a few years. We could buy an apartment, send our kids to good schools. You could quit your job and focus on your painting. I know that you say you don't need it, but... I love you and I want to give it to you anyway. I want to give you the package.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4289","Lily","The package?! You've already given me the package. You've got a great package, Marshall. I love your package.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4290","Marshall","Lily, you're the most incredible woman I know, and you deserve a big package.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4291","Lily","Your package has always been big enough. You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen, but you've got a huge package.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4292","Robin","Hello.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4293","Ted","Why hasn't she called yet?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4294","Robin","Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4295","Ted","No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4296","Robin","I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4297","Ted","Thanks. Anyway, it's almost 11 00. I should let you go. Break a leg.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4298","Ted from 2030","And so I was sitting at home, waiting for the phone to ring, something occurred to me.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4299","Ted","I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4300","Barney, singing","*He's giving you the blues. You want to graduate, but not in his bed. Here's what you got to do Pick up the phone...*","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4301","Ted","Marshall.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4302","Marshall","Hey, hey.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4303","Ted","Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you in a month.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4304","Marshall","Yeah. Yeah. How you doing?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4305","Ted","I think Victoria's about to break up with me.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4306","Marshall","Oh, God, I'm sorry, man.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4307","Ted","Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like. The more I try to picture her, the more I can't. Like, I remember how she makes me feel. I just... I don't completely remember her. It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4308","Marshall","Preserving something that's already gone. Sounds like environmental law.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4309","Ted","I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4310","Barney, singing","*Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds. Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds. Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap, ow. Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap...* Uh, rockupied. Dude, what...?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4311","Marshall","*Don't go breakin' my heart*","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4312","Lily","*I couldn't if I tried*","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4313","Marshall","*Honey, if I get restless*","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4314","Lily","*Baby, you're not that kind...*","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4315","Ted from 2030","It turns out some things are worth preserving. But here's the real question  It's 2 00 a.m. Your friends are still out singing karaoke, but you're home early 'cause you're expecting a call from your girlfriend in Germany, who was supposed to call four hours ago. And then the phone rings.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4316","Ted","Hello.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4317","Robin","Hi, Ted. It's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but, uh, do you want to come over?","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4318","Ted from 2030","What do you do? Go.","01","17","Life Among the Gorillas"
"4319","Ted from 2030","Previously on How I Met Your Mother...","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4320","Ted","She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and...","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4321","Lily","You have feelings for Ted.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4322","Robin","Maybe.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4323","Victoria","I've just been offered a fellowhip at a culinary institute in Germany.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4324","Ted","Do you want to try long distance?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4325","Victoria","Yes.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4326","Robin","""This long-distance thing sucks, huh? And I really need to talk to you tonight.""","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4327","Ted","She's going to dump me!","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4328","Robin","She's not going to break up with you, Ted.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4329","Ted","Hello?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4330","Robin","Do you want to come over?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4331","Ted from 2030","Kids, your grandma always used to say to me, ""Nothing good happens after 2 00 a.m.,"" and she was right. When 2 00 a.m. rolls around, just go home and go to sleep. Case in point","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4332","Ted","Hello.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4333","Robin","Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4334","Ted from 2030","Let's back up a little bit.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4335","Robin","Sit. Good boys. Okay, remember, stay out of the liquor cabinet. I'll see you tonight.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4336","Robin","And so the life of a television reporter is very rewarding, and I stronly urge you to consider it as a career. Thank you. Yeah?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4337","Little Girl","Do you have a fiancé?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4338","Lily","Marshall was here yesterday. They just learned the word ""fiancé.""","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4339","Robin","Oh, no, I don't have a fiancé.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4340","Little Girl","Then who do you live with?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4341","Robin","Well, actually, I've got five dogs.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4342","Little Girl","Don't you get lonely?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4343","Robin","No, I've got five dogs.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4344","Little Girl","My grandma has five cats and she gets lonely.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4345","Robin","Well, yeah, that's cats. I'm not some pathetic cat lady. Not that your grandmother is...","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4346","Robin","Does anyone else have a...? Yes?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4347","Little Boy","Are you a lesbian?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4348","Robin","No. Are you? Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les...","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4349","Lily","Okay, let's have a big hand for Robin the reporter. All right, our next guest is another friend...","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4350","Barney","So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks? 'Cause I just saw one. What up? Tiny five.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4351","Robin","Ha-ha. Laugh now, those kids are monsters. They're going to eat you alive.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4352","Lily","He has a job doing... What do you do?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4353","Barney","Please. Kids, let's rap. You guys don't give half a brown Crayola what I do for a living, do you?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4354","All","No.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4355","Barney","No. I know what you want. Magic.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4356","Robin","Hello.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4357","Ted","Why hasn't she called yet?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4358","Robin","Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4359","Ted","What's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4360","Robin","I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4361","Director","And we're clear.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4362","Man","So, Scherbotsky, got a boyfriend?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4363","Robin","No, and why does this keep coming up today?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4364","Man","Oh, I just thought that guy you were on the phone with...","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4365","Robin","What? Oh, no, that was Ted. He's just a friend. I mean, there was this moment where we almost dated, but we want completely different things. Anyway, now he has this girlfriend in Germany and he thinks she's calling to dump him tonight, but I don't think she is. And besides, we want completely different things.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4366","Man","We should have s*x.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4367","Robin","What?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4368","Man","Why not? We're both available, we're both attractive, we're both good at it. At least, I'm good at it. And even if you're not, don't worry, I'll have a good time either way.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4369","Robin","Well, moving past the horrifying image of your hair helmet clanging against the headboard, don't get involved with people I work with.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4370","Man","Get involved? Who said get involved? I'm just saying we should have s*x, it could be fun.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4371","Ted from 2030","Having s*x is fun.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4372","Man","Home number. Call me anytime. A lot of local teens in action tonight...","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4373","Robin","Hey, guys. Miss me? I missed you, too. Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over? Ted?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4374","Ted","Uh, yeah... Uh, hi, I'm here.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4375","Robin","Do you want to come over?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4376","Ted","Why? What's up?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4377","Robin","Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like, ""You know who likes juice? Ted.""","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4378","Ted","I love juice.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4379","Robin","Great. So you want to come over and make juice?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4380","Ted from 2030","When it's after 2 00 a.m., just go to sleep because the decisions you make after 2 00 a.m. are the wrong decisions.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4381","Ted","Okay, sure. I'll come over. We'll... juice.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4382","Robin","Yes, we'll juice.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4383","Ted","Okay.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4384","Robin","Okay... bye.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4385","Ted","Bye.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4386","Ted","This is fine. This is totally fine.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4387","Cab driver","What's fine?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4388","Ted","Oh, I'm, uh, going over to this girl's house to make some juice.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4389","Cab driver","Nice.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4390","Ted","No, it's not like that. We're juicing as friends. See, I have this girlfriend, I would never cheat on her. She lives in Germany. See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk. I still haven't heard from her. I don't know. Sorry to bug you with my problems. Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4391","Cab driver","You ain't kidding, kid. Want a nip?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4392","Ted","You can just let me out right up here.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4393","Cab driver","Where you going to, buddy?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4394","Ted","Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth. Okay, here's where I left off with the last guy. See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over to this other girl's house...","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4395","Victoria","And you're wondering if I'd be upset. Hi, Ted. Remember me, your girlfriend?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4396","Ted","Okay, relax, Robin's just a friend.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4397","Victoria","Right. You're going to go make some juice.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4398","Ted","Yes, yes! Juice is perfectly harmless. In fact, it's healthy.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4399","Victoria","Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering what she looks like naked?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4400","Ted","I am not won... Okay, even if I am wondering that, it's only 'cause you put it in my head.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4401","Victoria","Ah, but I'm just a manifestation of your subconscious, so actually, you put it in your own head.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4402","Ted","Damn it! Nothing's going to happen.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4403","Victoria","Right.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4404","Ted","Okay, okay. You want a second opinion? Fine.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4405","Marshall","Hey, did she call?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4406","Ted","No. I need a ruling. Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but I'm on my way over to Robin's right now. She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4407","Marshall","Let me call you back. Honey, there's a situation developing. Do you remember the huge secret that you told me that you weren't supposed to but you did? The thing... about Robin?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4408","Barney","Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4409","Marshall & Lily","What?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4410","Barney","Yeah, she told me already. Go on.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4411","Marshall","Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell? She told you and not me?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4412","Barney","Well, I guess I'm just better friends with her than you are.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4413","Marshall","Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4414","Barney","That is a lie!","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4415","Marshall","It is not a lie.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4416","Barney","Okay, that's it! You and me! I'm not afraid of you!","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4417","Marshall","I'll show you things you never seen before! I used to box in the Army!","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4418","Ted","Come on, pick up. Damn it, Victoria, where are you? Pick up, pick up!","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4419","Victoria","Cupcake?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4420","Ted","No, thanks. Where are you? Why haven't you called?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4421","Victoria","Oh, I'm out hooking up... with three other guys. Or maybe I'm a devoted girlfriend and I'm calling you right now.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4422","Ted","Yeah. Why do I doubt that? Hello.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4423","Marshall","Ted, I just saw the news and a truck carrying sulphuric acid overturned right in front of Robin's house. And it's melting through the sidewalk. You can see straight down into hell. It's bad. You should go home, dude.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4424","Ted","Marshall, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4425","Marshall","Ted, what does your mom always say?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4426","Ted","Nothing good ever...","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4427","Marshall","Nothing good ever happens after 2 00 a.m. Go home! It's too late for juice.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4428","Ted","Dude, Robin and I are just friends. She doesn't even like me that way.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4429","Lily","Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4430","Ted","What?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4431","Lily","It's a big secret, so don't tell her I told you, but she's very vulnerable right now and you have a girlfriend. Go home, Ted.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4432","Ted","She-she likes me?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4433","Lily","Yes. So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there. Go home, Ted.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4434","Ted","She likes me?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4435","Lily","Go home, Ted.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4436","Ted","Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4437","Lily","Good. He's going home.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4438","Marshall","He is so not going home. I cannot believe you just told him that.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4439","Lily","What do you mean?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4440","Marshall","Lily, here's what you just said  ""Ted, whatever you do, don't go up there. There's a beautiful girl who wants to have s*x with you. And then she's gonna make you some delicious juice.""","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4441","Lily","No, he's not going up there. He has more sense than that.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4442","Ted from 2030","I did have more sense than that.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4443","Ted","Keep the change.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4444","Cab driver","Thanks.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4445","Ted from 2030","But after 2 00 a.m, my good sense was sound asleep.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4446","Victoria","So you're doing this? You're going up there?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4447","Ted","You want to get out of the way?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4448","Victoria","I'm not in the way.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4449","Ted","You know, if you had just called me, I...","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4450","Robin","Hi.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4451","Ted","Hi. Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4452","Robin","Or we could just drink wine.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4453","Ted","Wine... not? Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4454","Robin","Thanks.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4455","Ted","Make it a big glass.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4456","Robin","Sure.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4457","Ted","So, how's it hanging?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4458","Robin","Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore or what the hell you're doing with your life? Do you ever have one of those days?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4459","Ted","Uh, about once a week.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4460","Robin","I don't know, it was just a, a rough day and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you. So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4461","Ted from 2030","When the clock strikes 2 00, just go to sleep.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4462","Ted","We broke up.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4463","Robin","What?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4464","Ted","Yeah. Yeah, she finally called. We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is-- and then... she dumped me.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4465","Robin","Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4466","Ted","You're smiling.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4467","Robin","Am I? No I'm not. I'm a news anchor. Smiling's a part of the job. Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today. See? You're smiling, too.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4468","Ted","Yeah. I have no idea what that's all about.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4469","Marshall","How much does Korean Elvis rock? I'll answer that. Infinity. He rocks... infinity.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4470","Lily","Okay, it's time for bed.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4471","Barney","What? No. It's 2 30.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4472","Lily","Nothing good ever happens after 2 00 a.m.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4473","Barney","You know, I have found, in my travels... that all the best things in life happen after 2 00 a.m. When I look back at the best stories of my life-- the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy, the almost four-way.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4474","Marshall","You never had a four-way.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4475","Barney","I said ""almost."" All those things happened after 2 00 a.m. because after 2 00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4476","Lily","We're going home.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4477","Barney","What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4478","Korean Elvis","Rock 'n' roll.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4479","Barney","And it begins.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4480","Ted","So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4481","Robin","Oh, yeah. Do you like it?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4482","Ted","Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4483","Robin","Wow. Weird.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4484","Ted","Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4485","Robin","I'll be here.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4486","Ted","Hello?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4487","Korean Elvis","Ted, this is your main man, K.E. I want you to shake your tail feathers down here ASAP, you dig?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4488","Marshall","Sorry about that.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4489","Ted","Was that Korean Elvis?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4490","Marshall","I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4491","Ted","Um... Actually... I'm at Robin's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4492","Marshall","Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis, but what the bleep are you doing, dude?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4493","Ted","What do you expect from me? It's Robin. Victoria's great, but, it's Robin. I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4494","Lily","Gonna?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4495","Ted","Yes. First thing tomorrow.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4496","Lily","Okay, but, but, as of right now at-at... 2 45 a.m. you still have a girlfriend. Ted, I love you. I love Robin. But if you do this right now, your entire future with her will be built on a crime. Just go home, Ted. Don't do this the wrong way.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4497","Ted","I hate how you're always right.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4498","Lily","It's my best and most annoying trait.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4499","Ted","Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4500","Robin","Hey.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4501","Ted","I should probably get going. It's pretty late. I'm sorry. I...","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4502","Robin","Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4503","Ted","Can I call you tomorrow?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4504","Robin","Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4505","Ted","Okay. Good night, Robin.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4506","Robin","Good night, Ted.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4507","Robin","Oh, my God. We're making out.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4508","Ted","Right.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4509","Robin","This is crazy.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4510","Ted","Right? Right?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4511","Robin","Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4512","Ted","Yeah.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4513","Robin","Yeah?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4514","Ted","Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4515","Robin","Okay.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4516","Ted","Stop doing that.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4517","Victoria","Whatcha doin'?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4518","Ted","I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4519","Victoria","Okay. Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be? Length of an average pee? No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes. Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive...","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4520","Ted","What do you want from me? People break up. It happens.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4521","Victoria","Not like this. Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4522","Ted","It's not ideal.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4523","Ted from 2030","Meanwhile, back at the bar, Barney was still trying to prove that good things can happen after 2 00 a.m.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4524","Barney","Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4525","Lily","I think he just spat on me.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4526","Marshall","Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4527","Barney","No! No, come on.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4528","Marshall","Yes!","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4529","Barney","Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the ""le"". We still got the ""gen."" The ""da."" The ""ry.""","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4530","Lily","Okay, if we're at the ""le,"" then I say we follow it up with a ""t's go home.""","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4531","Marshall","Oh, wow, you just got burned, phonics style.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4532","Korean Elvis","No, no, no, no, no. Baby, baby, baby, don't go. Just one dance, huh?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4533","Lily","Okay, seriously.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4534","Korean Elvis","Hey, I know what you like.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4535","Ted from 2030","And so, Barney was right-- the night was legendary. It would come to be known as The Time Lily Kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4536","Marshall","Hey, you guys remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4537","Ted","You're right. I owe you a real breakup call. I'll call you tomorrow.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4538","Victoria","Good. So you're gonna go home?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4539","Ted","Why should I have to go home? You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4540","Victoria","Ted.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4541","Ted","It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Robin. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4542","Victoria","Oh, please. You just want to get laid.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4543","Ted","Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4544","Victoria","That's not your phone.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4545","Ted","This isn't my phone.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4546","Robin","Okay. Bye. (She hungs up) I thought it was mine, so I answered it.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4547","Ted","Was it...?","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4548","Robin","It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4549","Ted from 2030","I called Victoria from the cab and we broke up. Yes... And there you have it, kids. The stupidest thing I've ever done. In one night, I managed to hurt two people I cared about. And none of it would've happened if I just listened to my mom. So I guess if there's a lesson to be learned here, it's this  when it's 2 00 a.m., just go to sleep.","01","18","Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M."
"4550","Ted","Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set? Disc three. My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone? Come on. Disc three! God, Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4551","Lily","What do you mean ""could""?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4552","Ted","I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4553","Barney","Trust that impulse, Ted.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4554","Robin","Hey. Something kind of cool just happened. My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4555","Lily","A... LAME-A?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4556","Robin","We prefer Local Area Media Award. Um... there's going to be this big banquet. I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came. And there's an open bar.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4557","All","Yes! Word up!","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4558","Ted","Yeah, put me down for two.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4559","Robin","Really? It's three months away.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4560","Ted","I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4561","Ted","I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4562","Barney","You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4563","Ted","Yes, that's what I meant by ""you know."" I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls. Look, I shouldn't go.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4564","Marshall","You should definitely go. Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4565","Barney","Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4566","Ted","That's only two.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4567","Barney","Count again.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4568","Ted","Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4569","Barney","So get an escort.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4570","Ted","By ""escort,"" you mean prostitute?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4571","Barney","Why not?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4572","Ted","Because... gross?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4573","Barney","Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4574","Marshall","You really think that's true?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4575","Barney","Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4576","Marshall","Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen. Kaboom! You've been lawyered.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4577","Barney","Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4578","Ted","Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have s*x with?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4579","Barney","Yes.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4580","Ted","No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4581","Barney","That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4582","Marshall","You just made that up.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4583","Barney","Withdrawn.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4584","Marshall","Lawyered. The point is, how long has it been?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4585","Ted","57 days.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4586","Barney","Is that your water? May I?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4587","Ted","Yeah, go ahead.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4588","Barney","Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4589","Ted","No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4590","Barney","Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4591","Ted","Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4592","Barney","You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic? That's racism. And I do not drink with racists. Good day.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4593","Ted","You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can...","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4594","Barney","I said good day!","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4595","Robin","So should I wear my hair up or down? Lily.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4596","Lily","What?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4597","Robin","You okay?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4598","Lily","Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm just exhausted from work. The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day. It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4599","Robin","Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were? Is that safe?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4600","Lily","Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4601","Robin","Ted's still coming to this thing, right?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4602","Lily","Yep.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4603","Robin","Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4604","Lily","Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4605","Robin","No, it's just this guy at the station. I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes. Is it going to be weird?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4606","Lily","No, it's not going to be weird at all. (Lily's on the phone with Marshall) Robin's bringing a date.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4607","Marshall","Boy. That's going to be really weird.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4608","Lily","I know.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4609","Marshall","Robin's bringing a date.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4610","Ted","Oh. Okay. That's not weird. She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4611","Marshall","Dude, it's going to be weird.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4612","Ted","No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4613","Barney","Yeah, it won't be weird.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4614","Ted","Thank you.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4615","Barney","Because you're going to bring your own date.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4616","Woman","Hello, Barney.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4617","Barney","Hi, Mary. Have you met Ted?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4618","Mary","Nice to meet you Ted.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4619","Ted","Hi, Mary. Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4620","Mary","So we're going to an award show?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4621","Ted","Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Barney.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4622","Barney","See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4623","Ted","What the hell?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4624","Barney","Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow. So I got you a date for the evening.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4625","Ted","You got me a hooker. A really hot hook-- A hooker!","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4626","Barney","Think about it, this is perfect. A  it will make Robin insanely jealous... B  you get to have s*x with her... and C  maybe by getting to know Mary, you'll come to see that courtesans are people, too. And D  ""B"" all night long.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4627","Ted","I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4628","Barney","The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall. No one will suspect a thing. They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and... Okay, that's a little bit suspicious. Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight. But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4629","Ted","500 bucks?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4630","Barney","Ted, you're my cabron. You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tranny from the Port Authority? Look at how hot she is. Robin would be so jealous.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4631","Ted","I'm not trying to make Robin jealous, Barney. Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4632","Ted from 2030","And then your Uncle Marhsall and I had one of our famous telepathic conversations.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4633","Marshall","Check out Robin's date.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4634","Ted","I know.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4635","Marshall","Is that who I think it is?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4636","Ted","Yep. It's Sandy Rivers.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4637","Ted from 2030","Sandy Rivers was the face of Metro News One, the most low-budget cable news network ever.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4638","Ted","Sandy time. Sandy time!","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4639","Ted from 2030","He was best known for his morning segment ""In Today's Paper,"" during which he literally flipped through today's papers, reading them aloud to viewers.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4640","Sandy","Here we have, on the front page, a story about a... I guess, a guy in a superhero costume climbing the Empire State Building. Looks interesting.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4641","Ted from 2030","These idiotic filler pieces were a guilty pleasure of ours.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4642","Ted","Which Sandy do we want today? French Sandy, p0rn star Sandy...?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4643","Marshall","Yosemite Sandy, definitely.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4644","Ted","Excellent choice. I love this guy.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4645","Ted","I hate this guy.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4646","Lily","Hey.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4647","Mary","Hi.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4648","Lily","I'm Lily.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4649","Mary","Hi. Mary. It's nice to meet you.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4650","Marshall","Mary is a friend of Barney's. Barney invited her. Just met Mary ourselves. Don't know too much about Mary. Look, a beer.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4651","Ted","Hey.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4652","Robin","Hi.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4653","Ted","You look nice.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4654","Robin","Oh, um, Ted, this is Sandy.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4655","Sandy","Hi. Sandy Rivers. Use my full name. People get a kick out of it.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4656","Ted","Hi, Sandy. Rivers. So are you two, uh...","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4657","Sandy","Starting a bunch of office rumors? Looks that way. Looks that way.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4658","Ted","Oh, how rude of me. Uh, Robin, Sandy... Rivers... this is Mary, my date.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4659","Voice","Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 45th annual Local Area Media Awards. Please say hello to our host for the evening, king of the Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie, Vampire Lou!","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4660","Vampire Lou","Tonight we celebrate the very best in broadcasting and the triumph of the human spirit.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4661","Marshall","Man, Vampire Lou just looks great.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4662","Ted","I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4663","Marshall","Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together, man. Secrets come out in there.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4664","Barney","Oh, please. How's it's going to come out? ""Uh, pass me a towel. P.S., I have s*x for money.""","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4665","Lily","Who has s*x for money?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4666","Marshall","Nobody. What did you guys talk about in there? Anything interesting?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4667","Lily","No, not really. We just chitchatted and I borrowed her lipstick. Why is Vampire Lou the host of a Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie? You know, it just makes no sense. God, that pisses me off.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4668","Ted","Lily, you okay?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4669","Lily","Oh, yeah, I'm just tired. And when I get tired, I get cranky.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4670","Sandy","Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4671","Lily","""Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.""","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4672","Mary","Wow. Why are you so tired?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4673","Lily","Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4674","Barney","Lily, quit your job. Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board, and you'll make a ton more money.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4675","Lily","Well, guess what, Barney? I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make, unlike you and, sadly, my fiance.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4676","Marshall","Well, it's just an internship, for the record.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4677","Lily","Yeah, because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck, what would that make me?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4678","Mary","A prostitute.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4679","Lily","Exactly. Thank you, Mary.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4680","Robin","So, Mary, what do you do for a living?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4681","Barney","She's a paralegal.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4682","Mary","Yes, I'm a paralegal.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4683","Robin","Oh, so, Mary the paralegal. What does a paralegal do exactly?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4684","Mary","I just assist with day-to-day clerical work in a law firm downtown.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4685","Lily","Oh, what firm?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4686","Mary","Douglas, O'Halloran and Stamp.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4687","Marshall","That's a real law firm.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4688","Mary","I know.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4689","Marshall","Nice.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4690","Ted","You're pretty good on your feet.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4691","Mary","Are you flirting with me?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4692","Ted","Is that allowed?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4693","Mary","Yes, it's encouraged.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4694","Ted","You know, I wouldn't normally say this on a first date, but... well, considering... I'm just going to say it. You are so hot!","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4695","Mary","Well, thank you.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4696","Ted","You're welcome.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4697","Robin","Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him. Don't let him out of your sight for a minute.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4698","Ted","So, Sandy, what do you do? Oh, wait, I know what you do. You're the guy who reads the paper in the morning.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4699","Sandy","You got me. What do you do, Ted?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4700","Ted","Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning. But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect where I make an actual contribution to the world. I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4701","Sandy","Thanks. I never tire of hearing that.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4702","Mary","Hey, you know that scene in Empire where they lower the helmet onto Darth Vader's head? Do you think that's how Sandy puts his hair on in the morning?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4703","Ted","You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love. Damn, you just got even hotter.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4704","Ted from 2030","And so, as the night wore on, I started to realize, this girl, despite what she did for a living, was kind of great.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4705","Ted","Hey.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4706","Robin","Hey. Mary seems nice. Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4707","Ted","I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4708","Robin","And just like that, it's all okay. Roll credits.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4709","Ted","So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4710","Robin","We're still friends.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4711","Ted","Are we? You don't return my calls, we never hang out and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4712","Robin","Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4713","Ted","Oh, so now she's a whore?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4714","Robin","What?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4715","Ted","You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome. And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous, I came here to support you as a friend. And frankly, I'm sick of trying.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4716","Sandy","I like that guy.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4717","Ted","Hey.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4718","Sandy","Hey. What were you guys talking about over there?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4719","Ted","Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4720","Sandy","Well, thanks. You know, this is one of the nicer hotels I've ever been in.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4721","Ted","Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel. You should see the rooms. The views are amazing.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4722","Mary","Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4723","Barney","Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts. Actually, don't use the mini-bar. Do it. Come on, Ted, do it. This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4724","Ted","Sleep with a prostitute?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4725","Barney","No, lose your virginity. What up. Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4726","Marshall","You just made that up.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4727","Barney","Withdrawn.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4728","Marshall","Lawyered. Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up. And second of all, you cannot do this. It's wrong on every level. And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4729","Ted","I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame. She's really cool.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4730","Marshall","Yeah, well... there we go.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4731","Vampire Lou","Scooter ""Bam-Bam"" Branson for A Bicycle-- Joyride or Deathtrap? Mike Murphy for 13, Pregnant and Addicted. And Robin Scherbotsky for Pickles, the Singing Dog. And the winner is... Robin Scherbotsky.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4732","Robin","Thanks. Oh, wow. This is really a surprise. Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends. They're all here tonight. Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers... Barney... And that's it. Those are all my friends. Thank you.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4733","Marshall","Congratulations.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4734","Robin","Oh, thanks. Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4735","Sandy","Sure. Let's go.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4736","Ted","Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs? We, uh, got a room.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4737","Marshall","Dude, what are you doing?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4738","Ted","What's it look like?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4739","Marshall","It looks bad, is what it looks like. You cannot do this.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4740","Ted","Marshall, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her. Besides, I'm trying to make Robin jealous.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4741","Marshall","Oh, that's real mature.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4742","Lily","Marshall, what is up with you and Ted?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4743","Marshall","Nothing, baby. Don't worry about it. Fine. Do what you want. Hey.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4744","Mary","Should we go?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4745","Ted","Yeah. Thanks. Well... Good night.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4746","Robin","Good night.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4747","Ted","So, did you and Barney ever...?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4748","Mary","There's not enough money in the world.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4749","Ted","Oh, thank God.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4750","Marshall","Wow, so they're...? Robin, where's Sandy Rivers?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4751","Robin","I put him in a cab.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4752","Barney","So you and he aren't...?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4753","Robin","I don't date people I work with. I was just trying to make Ted jealous. Is he...?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4754","Marshall","He's off trying to make you jealous.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4755","Robin","Oh, well, good for them. And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4756","Marshall","Lily, I know you're asleep, but I have to tell someone this, and we tell each other everything. So, here it goes. Mary's not a paralegal. She's a prostitute.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4757","Lily, waking up","Mary's a prostitute?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4758","Robin","What?!","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4759","Marshall","Barney paid for her.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4760","Lily","Is that true?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4761","Marshall","We were having a conversation about prostitution, and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar and now she and Ted are upstairs.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4762","Robin","Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately? Is he having a nervous breakdown?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4763","Lily","You know, Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low, but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle. Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah!","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4764","Marshall","That's her napkin.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4765","Lily","No!","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4766","Barney","Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any. In keeping with tonight's award show motif, I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending! Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4767","Vampire Lou","""Mary's not really a prostitute.""","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4768","Marshall","What?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4769","Barney","That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4770","Marshall","So she's not...?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4771","Barney","No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4772","Ted","I feel kind of like Richard Gere.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4773","Mary","Not shy about your looks, are you?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4774","Ted","No. You know, Mary, I've never done this before.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4775","Mary","Done what?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4776","Ted","You know, been... on a ""date.""","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4777","Mary","Yeah, right. Wait, you're kidding, right?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4778","Ted","No. Why, is that so odd?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4779","Mary","Well, Ted, I mean, I've been going on dates since I was 15.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4780","Ted","God, you were just a kid. Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and...","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4781","Mary","Yeah, that sounds great. I had clients riding me all day long.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4782","Ted","Must be tough.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4783","Mary","Yeah. I mean, this one guy just wouldn't leave me alone. I mean, talk about a**l. Well, here we are.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4784","Ted","Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot. I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this. You're a hooker.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4785","Mary","What?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4786","Ted","Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me. I'm not going to have s*x with a prostitute.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4787","Mary","No... Ted, I'm a paralegal.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4788","Ted","Come on, Mary, there's no one else around. You're a hooker.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4789","Mary","No, Ted... I'm a paralegal.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4790","Ted","No, you're a hooker.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4791","Mary","No, I'm a paralegal.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4792","Ted","You're a paralegal.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4793","Ted","That was not funny.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4794","Marshall","Not funny, dude.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4795","Barney","I know, it was hilarious.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4796","Ted","Why would you do that?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4797","Barney","I did it to prove a point.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4798","Ted","What point?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4799","Barney","Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date. All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet and your slump is over.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4800","Ted","So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4801","Barney","Come on, dude, you should be thanking me.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4802","Ted","She slapped me and stormed off.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4803","Barney","Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4804","Marshall","I'm sorry, dude, it was funny.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4805","Ted","Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4806","Barney","Your room?","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4807","Ted","Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card-- never checked out. By the way, you know what's super fun? Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain. Well, it's almost 3 00. Got a massage. Toodles.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4808","Marshall","Come on, if you don't laugh, it just seems mean.","01","19","Mary the Paralegal"
"4809","Ted from 2030","Kids, about eight months into Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall's engagement, there occurred a game-changing emergency.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4810","Marshall","Van Smoot is available.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4811","Lily","Oh, my God!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4812","Ted from 2030","Van Smoot House was a gorgeous mansion right on the Hudson River. It had everything Marshall and Lily wanted for their wedding, but it was never available. And then, suddenly, it was.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4813","Marshall","There was a cancellation two months from now.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4814","Lily","You want to have our wedding in two months? No. It's impossible.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4815","Marshall","It's Van Smoot, Lily. It's the dream!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4816","Lily","No, there's just not enough time. There's no way... Oh! Mini-vomit.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4817","Marshall","Okay, look, look, look. I know that it's sudden, but check it. If we don't take this, guess who's on their way with a deposit check.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4818","Lily","Todd and Valerie?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4819","Ted from 2030","When you're planning a wedding, there's always one couple with similar taste that seems to be one step ahead of you. Todd and Valerie were that couple.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4820","Marshall","We got to make a decision. Todd and Valerie are in motion. Van Smoot!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4821","Lily","Oh! Kids, color!(Lily runs out of class, Marshall runs out pf the appartment, they join in the street) Come on, baby.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4822","Marshall","Come on, come on, come on.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4823","Todd","Hello, Marshall. Lily.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4824","Marshall","Todd. Valerie. Stairs.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4825","Lily","I can't believe it. We got Van Smoot House.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4826","Marshall","It is on. It is on! Like the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4827","Robin","What?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4828","Marshall","You're a wonder.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4829","Ted","Wow! You guys are getting married in two months.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4830","Robin","How are you going to get everything done?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4831","Lily","Division of labor. Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up. Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4832","Ted from 2030","Robin had been mad at me since the night I slightly exaggerated my not-having-a-girlfriend-ness.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4833","Ted","Was it...?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4834","Robin","It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4835","Lily","Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist? And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4836","Marshall","Wow. That was really awkward, Lil. And still. It's still really awkward right now.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4837","Barney","Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4838","Lily","Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4839","Barney","Lil, you know I can't promise that.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4840","Marshall","Shh! Shh! Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out. Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4841","Lily","Crap! Band! We forgot a band! It's just gonna be silence and then people chewing.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4842","Marshall","Shh! Shh! Baby, don't worry about it. I called The 88!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4843","Lily","Who?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4844","Marshall","The 88. They're this awesome band. They played my law review party. They were found guilty. On three counts of rocking.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4845","Ted","I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding, they were great.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4846","Lily","John ""Bonzo"" Bonham from Led Zeppelin?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4847","Ted","Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer from Led Zeppelin, who died in 1980, got married two months ago.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4848","Lily","Look, I... I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen. We... we don't even know if they can play our song. They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4849","Marshall","Baby, The 88 don't audition. They're, like, the Wiggles of wedding bands.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4850","Lily","Well, then... I have to say no.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4851","Marshall","Baby, they're only holding the date until Monday.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4852","Lily","Well... well, are they playing anywhere this weekend?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4853","Marshall","Let me check their Website.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4854","Lily","What?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4855","Ted","Lily, you're being a wee bit intense about this band thing.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4856","Lily","Intense? I have a wedding to plan in nine weeks for 200 people. Even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt and consume this coffee table, I need you to roll with it, okay?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4857","Ted","Wow.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4858","Barney","Guys! I just tasted an amazing caterer.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4859","Lily","We already have a caterer.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4860","Barney","Oh, right. You're getting married. You see what I did there? Took a...","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4861","Marshall","It looks like The 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4862","Lily","A prom? Can... can we go to that?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4863","Marshall","Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4864","Lily","Yeah. No, they won't.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4865","Marshall","Why not?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4866","Lily","'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4867","Barney","No sweat, we'll just sneak in.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4868","Marshall","We're not sneaking in to a high school prom.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4869","Lily","Yes, we are. It's the only way.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4870","Ted","You're getting on board with Barney's idea? Man, you really have snapped.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4871","Lily","It's nine weeks till the wedding. At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4872","Barney","Well...","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4873","Lily","No, Barney.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4874","Ted from 2030","And so, Aunt Lily had the plan to crash the prom.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4875","Robin","I'll go with you.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4876","Lily","Really?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4877","Robin","Yeah. I never got to go to my prom. We always had field hockey nationals in the spring.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4878","Barney","Lesbian.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4879","Robin","The cough is supposed to cover the ""lesbian.""","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4880","Barney","No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4881","Lily","Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4882","Barney","Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep, and you've got ""statutory"" written all over your body.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4883","Ted","Hey, why don't we all go?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4884","Robin","I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in. We don't want to mess things up for Lily.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4885","Ted","Yeah, you're right. Besides, Marshall and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding. Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4886","Marshall","Sounds awesome. We should go out and just get freakin' weird.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4887","Ted","Yeah.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4888","Marshall","'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4889","Barney","Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear? Lame! But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4890","Lily","All right, what do you think?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4891","Barney","Horrible.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4892","Lily","You're gonna make such a great dad.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4893","Barney","You look so classy and nice. You're going to stick out like a sore thumb. Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days, with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris? They all dress like strippers. It's go ho or go home.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4894","Lily","Well, we have to get in. I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday, 'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have...","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4895","Robin","Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay? Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4896","Lily","All right.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4897","Barney","That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4898","Robin","I never thought this would be a bad thing, but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4899","Lily","I didn't know I still had this.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4900","Robin","What?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4901","Lily","The dress I wore to my actual prom.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4902","Scooter","Dude, you are the hottest girl at this prom, and not like in a corporate, plastic way. Like, truly, truly hot. Like a hot soul.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4903","Lily","Aw, you look great, too, Scooter.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4904","Scooter","So big news. I heard from umpire school. I'm in!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4905","Lily","Oh, disco! I am so happy for you.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4906","Scooter","You mean happy for us, right, babe?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4907","Lily","Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4908","Scooter","No, baby. We're gonna be an umpire someday.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4909","Barney","Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4910","Robin","No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore...","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4911","Barney","Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4912","Lily","Aw. Sweet. Thank you.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4913","Barney","Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4914","Robin","No. I've never been to prom before, okay?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4915","Lily","We got to go. See ya.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4916","Ted","Bye, have fun. See you.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4917","Marshall","They grow up into skanks so fast, don't they, Ted?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4918","Ted","So, what, we ready for tonight?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4919","Marshall","Yeah. Just one thing we got to do first.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4920","Ted","Shot of Jim Beam?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4921","Marshall","Yeah.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4922","Ted","Yes!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4923","Marshall","And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff 200 wedding invitations.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4924","Ted","What?!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4925","Marshall","I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4926","Ted","Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break. Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad, but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4927","Marshall","Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it. First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4928","Ted","Do I look like I'm four? All right, what kind of prize are we talking?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4929","Lily","Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4930","Robin","Is this gonna work?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4931","Lily","Yeah. Look, when I was 17, I used to sneak into clubs all the time. It's all about confidence. Follow me. Whee-hoo! Happy prom, everybody. Going to prom-- whee-hoo!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4932","Security guard","Uh, you're adults.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4933","Lily","Okay, bye. Okay, look, I just need to see the band. I'm getting married in two months, and...","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4934","Security guard","And you're just finding a band?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4935","Barney","Hey, ho, hey!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4936","Security guard","I'm sorry, ma'am. You either need to be a student or the date of a student.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4937","Lily","Wow. ""Ma'am?"" Check and mate.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4938","Barney","It's cool. Time to activate plan B. Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow? Scherbotsky?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4939","Robin","Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4940","Boy","We don't have that kind of money.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4941","Robin","For free.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4942","Boy","Oh, hell yeah!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4943","Robin","Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4944","Lily","Hi. Shall we?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4945","Boy","Sure. I knew it would happen. This is the dream.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4946","Robin","Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4947","Barney","Don't worry about me. I'll get in. Oh... I'll get in.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4948","Lily","We're in!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4949","Singer","Thank you. We're going to take a break.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4950","Lily","Oh, you're kidding me.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4951","Boy #1","Hey, uh, you ladies want something to take the edge off?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4952","Robin","Yeah, what the hell? It's prom. That tastes like cough syrup.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4953","Boy #1","Yeah, we couldn't get any alcohol. Um, our fake IDs say we're only 20. We didn't realize it till after we bought them.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4954","Robin","Nerds who aren't good at math? Life's going to be rough, boys.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4955","Lily","Hi. Excuse me. I was wondering if you guys could play ""Good Feeling"" by the Violent Femmes. I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married and my fiancé wants to hire you guys as the band, but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play ""Good Feeling"" because that's our song, and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4956","Man","Look, I'm kinda wasted right now, so I didn't understand any of that. But, uh, if you get us the sheet music, we'll play your song.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4957","Boy #1","So, you buzzing, baby?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4958","Robin","My phlegm feels looser.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4959","Ted","This is pathetic. It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights. If I got in a fight, would you have my back?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4960","Marshall","You know it.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4961","Ted","I'd have your back, too.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4962","Marshall","That's cool.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4963","Ted","What, you don't think you'd need my help? You don't know what I can do. I'm like... like a berserker.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4964","Marshall","Okay, Ted. (His phone starts rigging) Hello.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4965","Robin","Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music for ""Good Feeling"" and bring it out here, like, now.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4966","Marshall","Hang on. It's Robin. She wants me to go to prom. Can Ted come?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4967","Ted","Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame! I don't even want to go anyway.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4968","Robin","Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4969","Ted","What'd she say? What'd she say?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4970","Robin","He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me. I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive. Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's, it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4971","Marshall","Okay, bye. She totally wants you to come.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4972","Robin","All right, sheet music's on the way. Are you okay?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4973","Lily","There's just so much to do for this wedding. My head is swirling. It's just all moving too fast.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4974","Scooter","How is it moving too fast? We've been together for two years.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4975","Lily","I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4976","Scooter","What's decided? I go to umpire school, you go to college. We move into my dad's house in Staten Island. We have kids, we grow old together. What's decided? It's wide open!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4977","Lily","Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4978","Scooter","You're, you're breaking up with me?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4979","Lily","There's still so much I want to do. I want to travel, live overseas as an artist, maybe have a lesbian relationship. Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4980","Scooter","I can't believe this. I can change. I can look more like Kurt Cobain. Please, just don't leave me. I'm nothing without you, baby.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4981","Lily","Please don't put that kind of pressure on me! It's too much!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4982","Boy #2","It's just one dance, God!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4983","Lily","What?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4984","Robin","Well, we did promise them one dance.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4985","Lily","Yeah, sure, okay. So Andrew, what's your big plan? What's life going to be like after tonight?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4986","Andrew","Well, you know I got it all worked out. Uh, leave this place in my dust, four awesome years at college, and then I'll move to Prague or start my own video game company or something.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4987","Lily","No, you won't.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4988","Andrew","I won't?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4989","Lily","No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to. You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old before your time wondering ""Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?""","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4990","Andrew","Whoa. You really think I'll get a girlfriend?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4991","Boy #1","So, uh, what's the deal here? Am I getting lucky tonight?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4992","Robin","Oh, Sean, look, um, you're a nice guy, but I just don't... No, you're not getting lucky tonight.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4993","Giant Turtle","Okay, just be cool. Don't look at me.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4994","Ted","Okay.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4995","Giant Turtle","How'd you get in here?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4996","Marshall","What's it to you, giant turtle?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4997","Giant Turtle","It's me, Barney.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4998","Marshall","Oh, hey. Where's Lily?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"4999","Barney","She's in the bathroom.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5000","Marshall","Wait here, I should go talk to the band.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5001","Ted","All right.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5002","Barney","How did you guys get in here?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5003","Ted","We just snuck in the back.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5004","Barney","You just snu... Are you serious? I've been trying to get in here all night. I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5005","Ted","But you got in. Slow and steady won the race.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5006","Marshall","Hey, bro, have you seen my fiancée Lily?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5007","Andrew","Your fiancée? Whoa, tonight she's with me, bro. Unless you're looking for trouble.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5008","Marshall","Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom and the adrenaline's pumping, but...","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5009","Andrew","No, not tonight. I've waited too long for this. I finally got a girl and I'm not going to let you take her away from me.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5010","Marshall","Whoa, whoa. Look, let's not get carried away.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5011","Andrew","Yah! Nunchaku!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5012","Lily","I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5013","Robin","I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me. I'm going to ask you something and, um, maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever. But, um, are you having second thoughts?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5014","Lily","Yeah. But not about Marshall. About me. I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago and wondering what happened to her.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5015","Lily","I don't want to be tied down. I want to live in France and Spain and Italy and just soak up life and put it on a canvas, even if it means being a waitress in crappy cafés for five years, I don't care. I'm going to be a painter. And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know? But anyway, I'm blabbering. Way to make new friends, Lily. I'm sorry. What was your name again?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5016","Man","Marshall.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5017","Lily","Nice to meet you, Marshall. Guess we're hallmates.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5018","Marshall","Yeah.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5019","Lily","It works.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5020","Marshall","Violent Femmes. I love this song.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5021","Lily","Me, too.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5022","Lily","I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to. The travel, the bohemian art life, my big lesbian experience. I didn't do any of it.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5023","Robin","Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world. I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5024","Lily","Yeah.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5025","Robin","And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint. And as far as your lesbian experience... Happy?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5026","Lily","Yeah. So field hockey, huh?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5027","Robin","Shut up.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5028","Security guard #1","Trespassing, assaulting a minor. This mascot costume you stole cost $5,000.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5029","Security guard #2","We can have you guys arrested, you know that?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5030","Ted","Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus. You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5031","Marshall","I totally could have taken that kid.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5032","Ted","Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so...","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5033","Marshall","Well, I don't need it, but thanks.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5034","Ted","Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5035","Marshall","No, the kid was totally, like, a white belt and I'm gigantic. Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need to get in there for one more song.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5036","Security guards","Absolutely not.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5037","Barney","You guys will thank me for this later, okay? Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5038","Security guard #1","Hey!","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5039","Ted","You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly quick.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5040","Singer","This one goes out to that redhead girl and that tall guy.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5041","Ted","So how was your first prom?","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5042","Robin","You tell me. I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me, there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5043","Ted","So, basically, it was a prom.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5044","Robin","Okay, I've missed you. Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way, not even in an I-forgive-you way. Just in a I've-missed-you way.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5045","Ted","I'll take what I can get.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5046","Barney","And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth when you wear jeans to a strip club.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5047","Marshall","So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5048","Lily","Yeah, it's good.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5049","Marshall","Band? Check. Two months, baby. Two months.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5050","Lily","Two months.","01","20","Best Prom Ever"
"5051","Ted from 2030","Kids, life is a dark road. You never really know what's up ahead. One night you're cruising along enjoying the ride, and then all of a sudden, you're 28.","01","21","Milk"
"5052","Waitress","And for the birthday boy, lasagna.","01","21","Milk"
"5053","Ted","Thank you.","01","21","Milk"
"5054","Waitress","Careful. The plate is very hot.","01","21","Milk"
"5055","Ted","'Kay. Oh, go on, touch it.","01","21","Milk"
"5056","Lily","Ah! Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.","01","21","Milk"
"5057","Ted","All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?","01","21","Milk"
"5058","Robin","Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this.","01","21","Milk"
"5059","Barney","I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted.","01","21","Milk"
"5060","Marshall","You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy.","01","21","Milk"
"5061","Ted","Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time. Barney.","01","21","Milk"
"5062","Marshall","Oy, gevalt.","01","21","Milk"
"5063","Barney","Ah... Happy birthday, Ted.","01","21","Milk"
"5064","Ted","Whoo-hoo!","01","21","Milk"
"5065","Barney","Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y... Oh, my God.","01","21","Milk"
"5066","Woman","What?","01","21","Milk"
"5067","Barney","Oh! Call an ambulance!","01","21","Milk"
"5068","Woman","What's going on?","01","21","Milk"
"5069","Barney","Try not to speak. Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk.","01","21","Milk"
"5070","Waitress","Is she okay?","01","21","Milk"
"5071","Barney","I'm serious, call 911.","01","21","Milk"
"5072","Woman","What's wrong? What's the matter?","01","21","Milk"
"5073","Barney","Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try... Here, have some water. Water! Here, drink this. Shh! Shh!","01","21","Milk"
"5074","Robin","You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.","01","21","Milk"
"5075","Ted","Wait for it.","01","21","Milk"
"5076","Lily","28. Two more 'til the big one, three-oh.","01","21","Milk"
"5077","Ted from 2030","Actually, my 30th birthday wasn't so bad. Well, except for the goat in my bathroom. Which is a great story. But I'll get to that later.","01","21","Milk"
"5078","Lily","Still, you know, another year older. Still single. You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking?","01","21","Milk"
"5079","Ted","Nope. I hit the snooze button.","01","21","Milk"
"5080","Robin","And here come the paramedics.","01","21","Milk"
"5081","Barney","Oh, thank God, you're here.","01","21","Milk"
"5082","Paramedic","What is going on?!","01","21","Milk"
"5083","Barney","I think there might be some internal bleeding. Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital.","01","21","Milk"
"5084","Woman","What are you talking about?","01","21","Milk"
"5085","Barney","You've had a terrible fall.","01","21","Milk"
"5086","Woman","No, I haven't.","01","21","Milk"
"5087","Barney","Really? 'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven. Angel... Give him your number. What? Give him your number. What?","01","21","Milk"
"5088","All","Give him your number.","01","21","Milk"
"5089","Barney","Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.","01","21","Milk"
"5090","All","Give him your number.","01","21","Milk"
"5091","Barney","What are you...? Come on. They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number.","01","21","Milk"
"5092","Woman","All right!","01","21","Milk"
"5093","Barney","It works!","01","21","Milk"
"5094","Marshall","I cannot believe that she gave him her number.","01","21","Milk"
"5095","Robin","Maybe she really does have a brain injury.","01","21","Milk"
"5096","Barney","Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun. It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys. Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good.","01","21","Milk"
"5097","Ted","I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.","01","21","Milk"
"5098","Lily","Well, what's perfect?","01","21","Milk"
"5099","Ted","It's not like I have a list.","01","21","Milk"
"5100","Robin","Oh, yes, you do.","01","21","Milk"
"5101","Ted","Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...","01","21","Milk"
"5102","Lily","That's not hard. I know at least...","01","21","Milk"
"5103","Ted","I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.","01","21","Milk"
"5104","Marshall","Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.","01","21","Milk"
"5105","Ted","Any Kim from any cool band, really. Can't be too picky.","01","21","Milk"
"5106","Lily","You're never going to find this girl.","01","21","Milk"
"5107","Ted","Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me. I am done trying to plan the unplannable.","01","21","Milk"
"5108","Marshall","So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?","01","21","Milk"
"5109","Ted","That's the plan.","01","21","Milk"
"5110","Ted from 2030","And little did I know, at that very moment, fate... in the form of a 600 gigahertz superprocessing computer... was taking care of it.","01","21","Milk"
"5111","Ted","Whoa, you're up early.","01","21","Milk"
"5112","Lily","Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.","01","21","Milk"
"5113","Ted","Does Marshall know?","01","21","Milk"
"5114","Lily","He's still sound asleep.","01","21","Milk"
"5115","Marshall","Awesome. So awesome. God! Best girl ever. Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.","01","21","Milk"
"5116","Ted","Please don't do that. Hey, is this milk any good?","01","21","Milk"
"5117","Marshall","Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.","01","21","Milk"
"5118","Ted","God, why didn't you throw it away?","01","21","Milk"
"5119","Lily","I'm going shopping after work. I'll pick up some milk.","01","21","Milk"
"5120","Marshall","Oh...! These pancakes are delightful.","01","21","Milk"
"5121","Lily","What's wrong, baby?","01","21","Milk"
"5122","Marshall","This is the high point of my day.","01","21","Milk"
"5123","Ted from 2030","It was true. See, Marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment. But he needed money for the wedding, so he'd been interning for two months at Barney's firm... and he hated every minute of it.","01","21","Milk"
"5124","Marshall","Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.","01","21","Milk"
"5125","Barney","Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.","01","21","Milk"
"5126","Marshall","I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do.","01","21","Milk"
"5127","Barney","Just take a look, will ya? Okay, corner office. Top floor. Check out that guy. Name's Clark Butterfield. He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs.","01","21","Milk"
"5128","Marshall","So?","01","21","Milk"
"5129","Barney","So guess what I did to that sandwich? Here, I took a picture.","01","21","Milk"
"5130","Marshall","Oh! Sweet Lord.","01","21","Milk"
"5131","Barney","And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.","01","21","Milk"
"5132","Marshall","Ooh! Duck! That is sick! Why would you do that?","01","21","Milk"
"5133","Barney","Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot.","01","21","Milk"
"5134","Marshall","You?","01","21","Milk"
"5135","Barney","Totally. Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great.","01","21","Milk"
"5136","Marshall","What?","01","21","Milk"
"5137","Barney","Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern. This is war, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.","01","21","Milk"
"5138","Marshall","This is stupid.","01","21","Milk"
"5139","Barney","Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills. I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.","01","21","Milk"
"5140","Marshall","This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.","01","21","Milk"
"5141","Barney","Tracy, could you come in here, please? Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him.","01","21","Milk"
"5142","Tracy","Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer...","01","21","Milk"
"5143","Marshall","I get it. Thank you, Tracy.","01","21","Milk"
"5144","Ted","Hello?","01","21","Milk"
"5145","Man","Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?","01","21","Milk"
"5146","Ted","Speaking.","01","21","Milk"
"5147","Man","Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir? Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions. You signed up for our services about six months ago.","01","21","Milk"
"5148","Ted","Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.","01","21","Milk"
"5149","Bob","Right. Well... actually, that's why I'm calling. We found her, sir. We found your soul mate.","01","21","Milk"
"5150","Ted","I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?","01","21","Milk"
"5151","Bob","Well, my firm bought out the company. You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate, but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so... here I am.","01","21","Milk"
"5152","Ted","So I'm in good hands. You found me a match?","01","21","Milk"
"5153","Bob","There she is. Your soul mate. That'll be 500 bucks.","01","21","Milk"
"5154","Ted","No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.","01","21","Milk"
"5155","Bob","She's not engaged. She's your soul mate. Just read the file.","01","21","Milk"
"5156","Ted from 2030","So I read the file. And by God, this woman was perfect. She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina, she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword, she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna, her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl.","01","21","Milk"
"5157","Ted","All right, fine. Set it up.","01","21","Milk"
"5158","Marshall","You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?","01","21","Milk"
"5159","Barney","Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.","01","21","Milk"
"5160","Marshall","Tastes normal to me.","01","21","Milk"
"5161","Barney","That's what I thought, too. Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.","01","21","Milk"
"5162","Marshall","Oh, God!","01","21","Milk"
"5163","Barney","It got me as well.","01","21","Milk"
"5164","Marshall","Well, then why did you have me drink it?!","01","21","Milk"
"5165","Barney","Because now... you're in.","01","21","Milk"
"5166","Marshall","Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that b*st*rd pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first?","01","21","Milk"
"5167","Barney","Yeah, it's probably a good idea.","01","21","Milk"
"5168","Ted from 2030","So that night I had a blind date with my perfect match. I was so excited, I got there early. But before it even started...","01","21","Milk"
"5169","Ted","Lily?","01","21","Milk"
"5170","Lily","Hey, Ted, are you busy?","01","21","Milk"
"5171","Ted","Um... yes.","01","21","Milk"
"5172","Lily","Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot. Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?","01","21","Milk"
"5173","Ted","What? What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?","01","21","Milk"
"5174","Lily","Marshall can't know about this. Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story. Can you please hurry?","01","21","Milk"
"5175","Ted","I can't, I'm waiting...","01","21","Milk"
"5176","Lily","Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand? No, drifter, no!","01","21","Milk"
"5177","Ted","Come on, Lily.","01","21","Milk"
"5178","Lily","But you see my point.","01","21","Milk"
"5179","Ted","All right, stay there. I'm on my way.","01","21","Milk"
"5180","Ted from 2030","And so, one $90 cab ride later, I was in the middle of nowhere.","01","21","Milk"
"5181","Lily","Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date?","01","21","Milk"
"5182","Ted","Yes.","01","21","Milk"
"5183","Lily","And was she okay about pushing it back?","01","21","Milk"
"5184","Ted","Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?","01","21","Milk"
"5185","Lily","You can never tell Marshall.","01","21","Milk"
"5186","Ted","I won't.","01","21","Milk"
"5187","Lily","Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.","01","21","Milk"
"5188","Ted","I swear on Luke and Leia.","01","21","Milk"
"5189","Lily","About a month ago, I started getting insomnia. Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time. But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.","01","21","Milk"
"5190","Ted","Did you talk to Marshall about it?","01","21","Milk"
"5191","Lily","He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...","01","21","Milk"
"5192","Ted","That was you? Awesome!","01","21","Milk"
"5193","Lily","I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.","01","21","Milk"
"5194","Ted","Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.","01","21","Milk"
"5195","Lily","San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven.","01","21","Milk"
"5196","Ted","You don't want to get married.","01","21","Milk"
"5197","Lily","Of course I want to get married. I... It's not like I was ever going to do it. I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.","01","21","Milk"
"5198","Ted","Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means.","01","21","Milk"
"5199","Lily","Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid.","01","21","Milk"
"5200","Ted","I don't think you're stupid.","01","21","Milk"
"5201","Lily","I love Marshall.","01","21","Milk"
"5202","Ted","I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.","01","21","Milk"
"5203","Lily","But why am I the only one? How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?","01","21","Milk"
"5204","Marshall","So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.","01","21","Milk"
"5205","Ted","All done.","01","21","Milk"
"5206","Lily","Ted, let's go to New Haven.","01","21","Milk"
"5207","Ted","Lily, don't do this to yourself.","01","21","Milk"
"5208","Lily","I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure.","01","21","Milk"
"5209","Ted","No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.","01","21","Milk"
"5210","Lily","Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, ""Yep. That was a mistake."" So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you?","01","21","Milk"
"5211","Ted","I don't know. You said ""mistake"" a lot. Lily, don't do this.","01","21","Milk"
"5212","Lily","Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.","01","21","Milk"
"5213","Ted","Forgive you for what? (Lily leaves with he car) Lily. Lily! Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road. I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk... Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you. And, also, I texted you the same thing. (He calls Barney) Hey, I need a big favor.","01","21","Milk"
"5214","Barney","Anything, bro.","01","21","Milk"
"5215","Ted","I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.","01","21","Milk"
"5216","Barney","No.","01","21","Milk"
"5217","Ted","It's kind of an emergency.","01","21","Milk"
"5218","Barney","What are you doing in Duchess County?","01","21","Milk"
"5219","Ted","Apple picking. Can you just get up here?","01","21","Milk"
"5220","Barney","I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work. We're kind of swamped.","01","21","Milk"
"5221","Marshall","Is that Ted?","01","21","Milk"
"5222","Barney","Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County.","01","21","Milk"
"5223","Marshall","Don't you have a big date tonight?","01","21","Milk"
"5224","Ted","Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.","01","21","Milk"
"5225","Marshall","So what are you doing in Duchess County?","01","21","Milk"
"5226","Ted","Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!","01","21","Milk"
"5227","Marshall","Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you.","01","21","Milk"
"5228","Ted","No!","01","21","Milk"
"5229","Marshall","Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.","01","21","Milk"
"5230","Ted","No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank. I'm not in Duchess County.","01","21","Milk"
"5231","Marshall","So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County?","01","21","Milk"
"5232","Ted","Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.","01","21","Milk"
"5233","Barney","Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield.","01","21","Milk"
"5234","Marshall","You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously. Which is great, and everything, but I can't imagine having this much fun over there.","01","21","Milk"
"5235","Barney","You thinking about coming to work here full-time?","01","21","Milk"
"5236","Marshall","Maybe. Don't tell Lily, okay?","01","21","Milk"
"5237","Tracy","Taking off for the night.","01","21","Milk"
"5238","Barney","Thanks, Tracy.","01","21","Milk"
"5239","Tracy","Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?","01","21","Milk"
"5240","Barney","Of course we are. Were you going to think of that?","01","21","Milk"
"5241","Marshall","No.","01","21","Milk"
"5242","Barney","That would have been bad.","01","21","Milk"
"5243","Marshall","Horrible.","01","21","Milk"
"5244","Ted from 2030","Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home.","01","21","Milk"
"5245","Robin","Need a ride, cowboy?","01","21","Milk"
"5246","Ted","Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.","01","21","Milk"
"5247","Robin","Hmm, too bad. I got candy.","01","21","Milk"
"5248","Ted","Candy?!","01","21","Milk"
"5249","Robin","So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?","01","21","Milk"
"5250","Ted","Nope. Sworn to secrecy.","01","21","Milk"
"5251","Robin","Oh, come on.","01","21","Milk"
"5252","Ted","I like your hat.","01","21","Milk"
"5253","Robin","Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights.","01","21","Milk"
"5254","Ted","Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine.","01","21","Milk"
"5255","Robin","Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took ""highlights"" to mean, ""I want to look like a tiger,"" hence the hat.","01","21","Milk"
"5256","Ted","Oh. I gotta see this.","01","21","Milk"
"5257","Robin","No way.","01","21","Milk"
"5258","Ted","Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat!","01","21","Milk"
"5259","Robin","So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?","01","21","Milk"
"5260","Ted","Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.","01","21","Milk"
"5261","Robin","Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.","01","21","Milk"
"5262","Ted","Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.","01","21","Milk"
"5263","Robin","I read that. More like ""Love in the Time of Don't Bothera.""","01","21","Milk"
"5264","Ted","You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.","01","21","Milk"
"5265","Robin","We're not indoors. We're in a van.","01","21","Milk"
"5266","Ted","Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.","01","21","Milk"
"5267","Robin","Never. What else?","01","21","Milk"
"5268","Ted","She loves lasagna.","01","21","Milk"
"5269","Robin","Barf.","01","21","Milk"
"5270","Ted","You know, I am sensing a pattern here.","01","21","Milk"
"5271","Robin","What else?","01","21","Milk"
"5272","Ted","Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.","01","21","Milk"
"5273","Robin","And she's looking to get married and have kids?","01","21","Milk"
"5274","Ted","Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl.","01","21","Milk"
"5275","Robin","Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids.","01","21","Milk"
"5276","Ted","Really? You don't want kids?","01","21","Milk"
"5277","Robin","You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8 56. You're early.","01","21","Milk"
"5278","Ted","Hey, thanks for picking me up.","01","21","Milk"
"5279","Robin","Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for.","01","21","Milk"
"5280","Ted","Thanks.","01","21","Milk"
"5281","Robin","All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.","01","21","Milk"
"5282","Ted","You're going to show me your hair?","01","21","Milk"
"5283","Robin","Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.","01","21","Milk"
"5284","Ted","You just made my night.","01","21","Milk"
"5285","Robin","Go.","01","21","Milk"
"5286","Marshall","Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice. Oh, hey, dude.","01","21","Milk"
"5287","Ted","Hey, guys.","01","21","Milk"
"5288","Lily","Hi.","01","21","Milk"
"5289","Ted","Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?","01","21","Milk"
"5290","Lily","Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.","01","21","Milk"
"5291","Ted","You think you might want to... drink the milk?","01","21","Milk"
"5292","Lily","No. Nope, I'm good. I don't need any milk.","01","21","Milk"
"5293","Marshall","Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date. How'd it go, dude?","01","21","Milk"
"5294","Ted","I didn't go.","01","21","Milk"
"5295","Marshall","What? Why?","01","21","Milk"
"5296","Ted","I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.","01","21","Milk"
"5297","Marshall","Why? She sounds perfect.","01","21","Milk"
"5298","Ted","I don't want perfect. I want Robin.","01","21","Milk"
"5299","Marshall","Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake.","01","21","Milk"
"5300","Ted","Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make.","01","21","Milk"
"5301","Marshall","Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence. You and Robin have tried this again and again...","01","21","Milk"
"5302","Ted from 2030","Here's the thing about mistakes. Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake, you gotta make it anyway.","01","21","Milk"
"5303","Lily","Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.","01","21","Milk"
"5304","Ted","Hey, is this milk any good?","01","21","Milk"
"5305","Ted from 2030","Even really really dumb mistakes.","01","21","Milk"
"5306","Ted from 2030","It was May of 2006 in New York City and life was good. But everything was about to change.","01","22","Come On"
"5307","Ted","So... what do you think?","01","22","Come On"
"5308","Barney","Robin again? Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together. Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.","01","22","Come On"
"5309","Ted","But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?","01","22","Come On"
"5310","Marshall","Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills. Anybody else get chills?","01","22","Come On"
"5311","Ted","Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Robin, so... I gotta do this. (Barney slaps him) Ow! What the hell?","01","22","Come On"
"5312","Barney","That wasn't me. That was the universe.","01","22","Come On"
"5313","Ted from 2030","The funny thing was, at that very moment, the universe was working on something... a storm.","01","22","Come On"
"5314","Weather man","And so tropical storm Willy is going to be with us at least until Monday. It's gonna rain cats and dogs, folks. So don't step in a poodle. Sandy? Robin?","01","22","Come On"
"5315","Robin","Thanks, Lou. Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend.","01","22","Come On"
"5316","Sandy","Yeah, but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck.","01","22","Come On"
"5317","Robin","Guess we'll have to take a rain check.","01","22","Come On"
"5318","Sandy","And we'll check in with you tomorrow, New York.","01","22","Come On"
"5319","Robin","Have a great night.","01","22","Come On"
"5320","Man","And, we're clear.","01","22","Come On"
"5321","Sandy","Bummer. I was hoping to finally have s*x with you this weekend, Scherbotsky.","01","22","Come On"
"5322","Robin","Well, I'd give you the ""I don't date coworkers"" speech again, but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now.","01","22","Come On"
"5323","Sandy","Shame, though. It was a pretty hot show tonight. The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end really got my freak juice flowing.","01","22","Come On"
"5324","Marshall","Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash and burn before you say, ""enough""?","01","22","Come On"
"5325","Ted","One more. One more time. One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture. And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it. If it's yes, great. If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever.","01","22","Come On"
"5326","Lily","So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?","01","22","Come On"
"5327","Ted","I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment.","01","22","Come On"
"5328","Barney","I see where this is going. Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work... usually. The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999. The characters  Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name...","01","22","Come On"
"5329","Lily","Universe. So, this plan you speak of?","01","22","Come On"
"5330","Ted","Remember the first night Robin and I went out? I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.","01","22","Come On"
"5331","Marshall","Yeah. Dude, that was awesome, but how are you ever going to top that?","01","22","Come On"
"5332","Ted","She should be here any second.","01","22","Come On"
"5333","Musician","Uh, we're pretty hungry. When do we get our pizza?","01","22","Come On"
"5334","Ted","Enough with the... we'll go get pizza later, all right? Just...","01","22","Come On"
"5335","Robin","Damn it.","01","22","Come On"
"5336","Lily","Hello.","01","22","Come On"
"5337","Robin","Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key.","01","22","Come On"
"5338","Lily","Extra key? Do I have an extra key to your apartment?","01","22","Come On"
"5339","Robin","Yes, I gave it to you.","01","22","Come On"
"5340","Lily","Oh, right. That key. Yeah, I lost it.","01","22","Come On"
"5341","Robin","Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith.","01","22","Come On"
"5342","Lily","No, wait, uh... Maybe you should just knock.","01","22","Come On"
"5343","Robin","Knock? Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained.","01","22","Come On"
"5344","Voice mail","Hello, Lily, this is Janet Kagan at the Russell House Art Foundation here in San Francisco. I'm pleased to inform you that we've accepted your application for our summer fellowship. We look forward to hearing from you. Bye-bye.","01","22","Come On"
"5345","Lily","Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay?","01","22","Come On"
"5346","Marshall","Summer fellowship?","01","22","Come On"
"5347","Robin","Just knock. Okay.","01","22","Come On"
"5348","Ted","Hi.","01","22","Come On"
"5349","Robin","Hi.","01","22","Come On"
"5350","Ted","Robin... I've sort of said this already. I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly. So this is me, just saying it. With strings. I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together. What do you say? What do you say?","01","22","Come On"
"5351","Robin","Yes. No. I don't know.","01","22","Come On"
"5352","Ted","Those are the three options.","01","22","Come On"
"5353","Robin","Ted, this is so...","01","22","Come On"
"5354","Ted","I know.","01","22","Come On"
"5355","Robin","I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and... I have to pee.","01","22","Come On"
"5356","Ted","Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait.","01","22","Come On"
"5357","Musician","Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier, you said there'd be pizza.","01","22","Come On"
"5358","Ted","No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards. Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here.","01","22","Come On"
"5359","Musician","Sure. We're not getting any pizza.","01","22","Come On"
"5360","Robin","Okay. Let's talk.","01","22","Come On"
"5361","Ted","Okay. Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?","01","22","Come On"
"5362","Robin","Thanks, guys. Just need a minute. Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though. Kind of an inside joke. Thanks. (The musicians leave) You're crazy.","01","22","Come On"
"5363","Ted","Right. Come on.","01","22","Come On"
"5364","Robin","It's not that I haven't thought about this. You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay? We only just started being friends again.","01","22","Come On"
"5365","Ted","I know. But... come on...","01","22","Come On"
"5366","Robin","And we want different things. That's still there. That's not going away. I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out and I'd lose you as a friend? I gotta think about this.","01","22","Come On"
"5367","Ted","Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane. Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious. I'm kidding. I'm serious.","01","22","Come On"
"5368","Robin","I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping.","01","22","Come On"
"5369","Ted","I thought that thing was canceled.","01","22","Come On"
"5370","Robin","Well, it's back on.","01","22","Come On"
"5371","Ted","Since when?","01","22","Come On"
"5372","Robin","Since like an hour ago.","01","22","Come On"
"5373","Weather man","..sending the storm back out into the Atlantic. So it's blue skies this weekend. Sandy? Robin?","01","22","Come On"
"5374","Sandy","Thanks, Lou, but that blue sky isn't without at least one cloud. I'm sorry to announce that one week from today I will be leaving Metro News One. It has been an honor to bring you the news each night, and read the paper to you each morning. I will always treasure it. Good night, New York.","01","22","Come On"
"5375","Man","And we're clear.","01","22","Come On"
"5376","Robin","You're leaving?","01","22","Come On"
"5377","Sandy","There. I quit my job. We're not coworkers. Will you please have dinner with me? I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN.","01","22","Come On"
"5378","Robin","Oh, congratulations.","01","22","Come On"
"5379","Sandy","Congratulations yourself.","01","22","Come On"
"5380","Robin","What do you mean?","01","22","Come On"
"5381","Sandy","Well, Joel asked me who I thought should replace me as lead anchor. I told him you. They're announcing it next week. Act surprised.","01","22","Come On"
"5382","Robin","Wow. Thanks. And, yes.","01","22","Come On"
"5383","Sandy","Yes, what?","01","22","Come On"
"5384","Robin","Yes, let's go get dinner.","01","22","Come On"
"5385","Sandy","How about this weekend on the camping trip? I roast a mean weenie.","01","22","Come On"
"5386","Ted","Oh, you're kidding me. No way. Don't go on this thing.","01","22","Come On"
"5387","Robin","Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip.","01","22","Come On"
"5388","Ted","Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date. With Sandy... and his weenie. I mean is this not a date?","01","22","Come On"
"5389","Robin","I don't-I don't know.","01","22","Come On"
"5390","Ted","So, what? You actually like this guy now?","01","22","Come On"
"5391","Robin","I don't know.","01","22","Come On"
"5392","Ted","Are you gonna hook up with him?","01","22","Come On"
"5393","Robin","I don't know.","01","22","Come On"
"5394","Ted","Yes, you do.","01","22","Come On"
"5395","Robin","No, Ted, I don't. And you know what? That's okay. I don't plan out every second of my life like you do.","01","22","Come On"
"5396","Ted","I don't plan out every...","01","22","Come On"
"5397","Robin","Oh, really? What is all of this? I mean, why can't you just say, ""Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?"" No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates and let's spend the rest of our lives together.","01","22","Come On"
"5398","Ted","Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point? God, you are so terrified of anything real. It's like you're floating out in space. Touch the ground, Robin. Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake.","01","22","Come On"
"5399","Robin","I need to think about this.","01","22","Come On"
"5400","Ted","Fine.","01","22","Come On"
"5401","Robin","No, I'm sorry, I... I can't do this anymore. I need an answer.","01","22","Come On"
"5402","Ted","If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that.","01","22","Come On"
"5403","Robin","Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no.","01","22","Come On"
"5404","Ted","Then I guess it's not meant to be.","01","22","Come On"
"5405","Barney","Nice try, buddy.","01","22","Come On"
"5406","Marshall","Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure. She's made her choice and you can finally move on.","01","22","Come On"
"5407","Ted","Screw that. This ain't over.","01","22","Come On"
"5408","Marshall","Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said...","01","22","Come On"
"5409","Ted","I don't care what I said. This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be. It is meant to be, and you know why? 'Cause I mean it to be.","01","22","Come On"
"5410","Lily","Unpause?","01","22","Come On"
"5411","Marshall","Unpause.","01","22","Come On"
"5412","Ted from 2030","Let's pause. See, Marshall and Lily had a rule that at any point during a fight they could pause and take a break. Their fights often lasted for days.","01","22","Come On"
"5413","Marshall","A painting fellowship?","01","22","Come On"
"5414","Lily","I was never going to take it.","01","22","Come On"
"5415","Marshall","In California?","01","22","Come On"
"5416","Lily","I was never going to take it.","01","22","Come On"
"5417","Barney","Ted, she is going on that camping trip. Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.","01","22","Come On"
"5418","Ted","Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is.","01","22","Come On"
"5419","Barney","What are you talking about?","01","22","Come On"
"5420","Ted","I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain!","01","22","Come On"
"5421","Barney","Ted, do you want me to slap you again? 'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.","01","22","Come On"
"5422","Ted","Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?","01","22","Come On"
"5423","Barney","Yeah.","01","22","Come On"
"5424","Ted","Are you still in touch with her?","01","22","Come On"
"5425","Barney","Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having s*x, we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up, and of course I'm not in touch with her!","01","22","Come On"
"5426","Ted","Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.","01","22","Come On"
"5427","Barney","Did you just say a ""rain dance""?","01","22","Come On"
"5428","Ted","Yes.","01","22","Come On"
"5429","Barney","A rain dance.","01","22","Come On"
"5430","Ted","Yes.","01","22","Come On"
"5431","Barney","A dance to make it rain.","01","22","Come On"
"5432","Ted","Yes. (Barney slaps him once again and Ted slaps him back. Barney tries again to slaps Ted but he stops him) We're finding Penelope!","01","22","Come On"
"5433","Barney","No, we are not!","01","22","Come On"
"5434","Ted","Yes, we are!","01","22","Come On"
"5435","Barney","Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!","01","22","Come On"
"5436","Penelope","Why the hell should I help you?","01","22","Come On"
"5437","Barney","Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship.","01","22","Come On"
"5438","Penelope","We had s*x twice in your car, and then you dumped me. How is that a relationship?","01","22","Come On"
"5439","Barney","Twice!","01","22","Come On"
"5440","Penelope","Barney, there is no way...","01","22","Come On"
"5441","Barney","Shh!","01","22","Come On"
"5442","Penelope","Seriously, come on.","01","22","Come On"
"5443","Ted","Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend.","01","22","Come On"
"5444","Penelope","Why?","01","22","Come On"
"5445","Ted","There's this girl...","01","22","Come On"
"5446","Penelope","""There's this girl."" You know, the traditional rain dance is a sacred prayer to nature. I don't think the Great Spirit looks too kindly on white dudes who co-opt it to get laid.","01","22","Come On"
"5447","Ted","Penelope, this is the girl I love. If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy. Please.","01","22","Come On"
"5448","Penelope","This wrong guy, is he a huge jackass?","01","22","Come On"
"5449","Ted","Absolutely.","01","22","Come On"
"5450","Penelope","Kind of like Barney?","01","22","Come On"
"5451","Ted","Kind of.","01","22","Come On"
"5452","Barney","Hey.","01","22","Come On"
"5453","Penelope","You hit on my mom!","01","22","Come On"
"5454","Barney","We weren't exclusive!","01","22","Come On"
"5455","Penelope","I'm in.","01","22","Come On"
"5456","Ted from 2030","And so the three of us headed up to the roof of my building.","01","22","Come On"
"5457","Penelope","Okay. Crouch down and bend over a little bit.","01","22","Come On"
"5458","Barney","Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position.","01","22","Come On"
"5459","Penelope","I will throw you off this roof.","01","22","Come On"
"5460","Barney","There's so much of your mom in you.","01","22","Come On"
"5461","Robin","And she's been throwing up ever since.","01","22","Come On"
"5462","Veterinary","So how'd she manage to eat so much chocolate?","01","22","Come On"
"5463","Robin","Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about? Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment with a string quartet and roses and chocolates...","01","22","Come On"
"5464","Veterinary","Oh, that's so sweet.","01","22","Come On"
"5465","Robin","Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy? I mean, a string quartet in my living room... who does that?","01","22","Come On"
"5466","Veterinary","Nobody does that.","01","22","Come On"
"5467","Robin","Exactly.","01","22","Come On"
"5468","Veterinary","No, honey... nobody does that. But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic. I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now.","01","22","Come On"
"5469","Lily","So you're saying you would forbid me from going?","01","22","Come On"
"5470","Marshall","Forbid? Who said forbid? I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months, and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day. Look for me... I'll be the guy in the awesome suit. Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted.","01","22","Come On"
"5471","Lily","Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them. I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever.","01","22","Come On"
"5472","Marshall","So now we've gone from ""I was never gonna do it"" to ""I need to do this""? Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?","01","22","Come On"
"5473","Lily","Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it.","01","22","Come On"
"5474","Marshall","I never said that! You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now, what's gonna change in three months? Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.","01","22","Come On"
"5475","Lily","Maybe not.","01","22","Come On"
"5476","Marshall","Pause.","01","22","Come On"
"5477","Lily","So, are you just, like, starving?","01","22","Come On"
"5478","Marshall","Totally. Red Lobster?","01","22","Come On"
"5479","Lily","Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious!","01","22","Come On"
"5480","Marshall","Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it. Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you.","01","22","Come On"
"5481","Lily","I wouldn't dare. (Marshall starts crying) Marshall, no. We're on pause. There's no crying in Pauseland! Pauseland is a magical place, with... with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers! Damn it!","01","22","Come On"
"5482","Waiters","Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy birthday, happy, happy, happy, happy, appy, happy birthday, happy, happy...","01","22","Come On"
"5483","Barney","Ted, this is funny. Still funny. Still fu... And now it's sad.","01","22","Come On"
"5484","Ted","Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?","01","22","Come On"
"5485","Penelope","I think so.","01","22","Come On"
"5486","Ted","Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance?","01","22","Come On"
"5487","Penelope","I think so.","01","22","Come On"
"5488","Ted","Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?","01","22","Come On"
"5489","Penelope","No.","01","22","Come On"
"5490","Ted","No?","01","22","Come On"
"5491","Penelope","I've read extensively on the subject  firsthand accounts, theoretical criticism, the anthropological...","01","22","Come On"
"5492","Ted","Have you ever seen a rain dance?","01","22","Come On"
"5493","Penelope","I've seen a film strip.","01","22","Come On"
"5494","Ted","Terrific. Uh, look, I should run. I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R. I can't believe this. We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves.","01","22","Come On"
"5495","Penelope","What do you mean ""we,"" white man?","01","22","Come On"
"5496","Marshall","How did we get here? Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was, did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge.","01","22","Come On"
"5497","Lily","I think there's still one left.","01","22","Come On"
"5498","Marshall","Dibs.","01","22","Come On"
"5499","Lily","Unpause?","01","22","Come On"
"5500","Marshall","Unpause.","01","22","Come On"
"5501","Lily","Look... I know this sucks. It's just something I'm going through. I'm not asking you to understand it. I'm not asking you to be happy about it. I'm just asking you to support it.","01","22","Come On"
"5502","Marshall","I want to, Lily, okay? I really do. But I just can't.","01","22","Come On"
"5503","Lily","Why not?","01","22","Come On"
"5504","Marshall","Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not. What if you decide to go be a painter and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore, and three months becomes forever? Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?","01","22","Come On"
"5505","Lily","Marshall...","01","22","Come On"
"5506","Marshall","'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now. I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out.","01","22","Come On"
"5507","Lily","Marshall, I love you.","01","22","Come On"
"5508","Marshall","Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?","01","22","Come On"
"5509","Lily","Pause.","01","22","Come On"
"5510","Marshall","No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore. Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?!","01","22","Come On"
"5511","Lily","Pause!","01","22","Come On"
"5512","Marshall","Why do you want me to pause?! (She throws herself on him et kisses him) That's just a great use of the pause function, baby.","01","22","Come On"
"5513","Lily","Thank you.","01","22","Come On"
"5514","Barney","Hey, Ted. Whatcha doing?","01","22","Come On"
"5515","Ted","A rain dance.","01","22","Come On"
"5516","Barney","Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.","01","22","Come On"
"5517","Ted","Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour.","01","22","Come On"
"5518","Barney","These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl. This isn't gonna work!","01","22","Come On"
"5519","Ted","Yeah. I know that.","01","22","Come On"
"5520","Barney","Well, then why are you doing this?","01","22","Come On"
"5521","Ted","Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work. But it has to work! You hear me, universe? This is Ted Mosby talking! Give me some rain! Come on! Come on! Come on...!","01","22","Come On"
"5522","Barney","Oh, come on!","01","22","Come On"
"5523","Weather man","Pushing the front back into the Tri-State area and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade.","01","22","Come On"
"5524","Barney","How about that? He did it.","01","22","Come On"
"5525","Ted","Robin! Hey, Robin! (Robin opens up her window) Oh, thank God you're here!","01","22","Come On"
"5526","Robin","My camping trip got rained out.","01","22","Come On"
"5527","Ted","I know. I'm sorry.","01","22","Come On"
"5528","Robin","It's not your fault.","01","22","Come On"
"5529","Ted","Yeah, it is. Come down here.","01","22","Come On"
"5530","Robin","It's pouring. You come up.","01","22","Come On"
"5531","Ted","No, you have to come down here.","01","22","Come On"
"5532","Robin","Why?","01","22","Come On"
"5533","Ted","Why? Because I made it rain, that's what I did today! And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!","01","22","Come On"
"5534","Robin","I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up.","01","22","Come On"
"5535","Ted","I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not. You have to come down here!","01","22","Come On"
"5536","Robin","I was gonna...","01","22","Come On"
"5537","Ted","I know.","01","22","Come On"
"5538","Ted from 2030","And that's how Robin and I ended up together. Turns out, all I had to do was make it rain. As I rode home the next morning, the city looked the same, the people looked the same. It all looked the same. But it wasn't. In just one night, everything had changed.","01","22","Come On"
"5539","Ted","OK, where was I? It was June 2006 and life had just taken an unexpected turn.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5540","Ted's daughter","Can't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom? I feel you've been talking for like a year","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5541","Ted","Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important. It's all part of the story.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5542","Ted's son","Can I go to the bathroom?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5543","Ted","No. The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful. For me, it started out great. (In 2006, Ted and Robin are kissing after the rain dance) In fact, day one was amazing. I'd finally gotten together with Robin. But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life, your Uncle Marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his (Ted finds Marshall on their stairs, holding in his hand Lily's engagement ring).","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5544","Marshall","So that's it? We're breaking up?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5545","Lily","Marshall, I'm sorry. I just... I just need to go to San Francisco and do this art program and figure out who I am outside of us. And the only way that I can do that is if we don't talk for a while.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5546","Marshall","For a while? Try never, OK? You walk out that door and we're done. You're never gonna hear my voice again.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5547","Marshall","I should call her.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5548","Ted","No! No! If you call her, when she asked you not to, you're just gonna look weak and you're gonna regret it. Now, listen. Whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first... and I will punch you in the face.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5549","Marshall","You're a good friend Ted.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5550","Robin","Hey! So, did you hear the big news?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5551","Ted","You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up and Lily is gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night? Yeah, I think he knows.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5552","Robin","Oh my god! I... I'm so sorry. What happened?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5553","Marshall","Well, she left. And I don't even know if she's coming back.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5554","Barney","I didn't get your message until I woke up. Bro, I am so sorry.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5555","Marshall","Thanks.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5556","Barney","I know it must be tough. But are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better but will actively excite you?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5557","Marshall","Sure.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5558","Barney","For the first time ever, the three of us are single at the same time. I've dreamed about this day boys and it's going to be legendary! Together, we will own this city. Any time, a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriend, we'll be there. Any time a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge-drinking, we will be there. Any time a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo sticking their heads out, shouting ""What's up New York?"" we will be what is up New York! Gentlemen, we are about to embark on... (While he's speaking, Barney looks at Ted and then at Robin). Oh man, you guys did it, didn't you?!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5559","Ted from 2030","One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning (Ted and Robin are making out) and love is ending (Lily is leaving the apartment, leaving Marshall alone) the first thirty days are remarkably similar. (DAY ONE, Ted and Robin are in bed after they had s*x) For one thing, you spend most of the time in bed (Marshall is in his bed groaning // DAY EIGHT, Ted and Robin are at MacLaren's with Barney, kissing and laughing. Barney seems to kill himself, miming a gun in his mouth) Your friends can't stand to listen to you (DAY SIXTEEN, Barney is with Marshall who is crying and says ""It was a really beautiful song"". Barney mimes a rope around his neck). And you never seems to wear pants. (DAY TWENTY-TWO, at the apartment, Robin is going to the bathroom only wearing a T-shirt while Marshall is wallowing on the couch in underpants. Ted, in underpants too, comes out of his room).","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5560","Ted","Hey Marshall.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5561","Marshall","Hey Ted.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5562","Ted","Are you hungry?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5563","Marshall","What's the point? I could it some food, it's just gonna leave me.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5564","Ted","At least in that scenario, you get to do the dumping. Come on, it's Sunday, it's pancakes day!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5565","Marshall","Lily always made the pancakes. God, I loved her pancakes. So soft. So warmed. So perfectly shaped.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5566","Ted","Are we still talking about her pancakes? Come on, you gotta eat something. What can I get you?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5567","Marshall","Beer.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5568","Ted","No, that's what you had for dinner.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5569","Marshall","Fine. Than I'll just have the leftover","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5570","Barney","So he stays home all the time not getting laid? No, see, that's what you do when you have a fiancée. He should be down here celebrating. He's free. He got that red-head-tumor removed.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5571","Ted","You should write and illustrate children's books.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5572","Barney","You know what Marshall needs to do? He needs to stop being sad. When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5573","Ted","It's only been a month. He just needs to goat his own pace. Anyway, lily is the one who caused this whole mess.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5574","Robin","Hey, cut her some slack! She's our friend too. She's just trying to figure out who she is.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5575","Ted","Figure out who she is? She should call me. I got a whole list. She's selfish, she's immature, she's...","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5576","Robin","What?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5577","Ted","God, your eyes are so blue.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5578","Robin","Teddy bear... (They kiss, Barney mimes his death with a sword. Ted and Robin look at him and keep kissing)","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5579","Ted from 2030","Yeah it was hard to feel too bad. I was dating the woman of my dreams and things were going great. Well, for the most part. (Ted and Robin are watching TV, Marshall comes out of the bathroom, a bottle of shampoo in his hand).","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5580","Marshall","So, I find her shampoo. I guess she left it here. It smells like her. Like lavender and seashells. Hope. Somehow erotic and comforting all at the same time.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5581","Robin","That's my shampoo.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5582","Marshall","Oh. Sorry.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5583","Robin","I thought he's never go to sleep.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5584","Ted","Uh-oh.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5585","Robin","Already?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5586","Ted","He's calling her. Dammit!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5587","Robin","I don't hear anyth...Ted (going out of the bedroom)  He's calling her! (Tackling Marshall) Argh!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5588","Marshall","Oh! OK, you're right. I won't call her. I will not call her.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5589","Marshall","Well, I called her. And get this, she changed her number. Well like I'm gonna stalk her or something? Like she's so special?! Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there? 'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her, based on the brief conversations I had with them!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5590","Robin (to Ted)","Does he know I'm in here?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5591","Marshall","Yeah. Hey Robin. Anyway, one of the Lily Adrins...","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5592","Robin","This has to stop! Ted, we just started dating. We agreed we don't wanna move too fast and yet somehow we have a baby. He can't feed himself, he cries a lot, he keeps us up all night...","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5593","Barney","Have you tried breast-feeding? Nailed it!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5594","Ted","They were together nine years. It's only been a month and a half. He just needs to go his own pace.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5595","Robin","He slept on our floor last night Ted.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5596","Ted","He watched a scary movie.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5597","Robin","It is time for some tough love. We need to get him out of that apartment. He needs fresh air. He needs sunshine.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5598","Barney","Mmm. Sunshine.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5599","Man","Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Sunshine!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5600","Marshall","Barney, I really don't think this is gonna help.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5601","Barney","Do you know why you're not over Lily yet? It's 'cause you can still picture her naked. You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs. It's a scientific fact. The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images, or BPEGs and your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5602","Marshall","There are a lot of them.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5603","Barney","They won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs. Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs so we begin here tonight my friend. Two at the time. Those count as four.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5604","Ted","Yeah, this is fun, right? We're outside, it's a beautiful day. The Indians are winning!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5605","Marshall","I gotta admit, it is really nice to be outside.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5606","Man","Yankee's fans, please turn your attention to the Diamond Vision for a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5607","Ted","Oh, no. (A man is proposing to his girlfriend. Marshall stands up and throws a hotdog at the engaged couple.)","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5608","Marshall","It's all a big lie! She's just gonna break your heart! (Men drag Marshall out of the stadium) You can drag me outta here, but she has no soul!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5609","Ted","We've tried everything. Baseball, strippers. The guy still won't eat a damn pancake. I think he's beyond repair.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5610","Robin","See, this is the problem with guys, you don't know how to deal with heartbreak.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5611","Barney","So what's your prescription, Dr Oestrogen? Eat H&auml;agen-Dazs and Watch Love actually until your periods sync up? (Ted and Barney laugh)","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5612","Robin","Yeah, that's the stuff.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5613","Marshall","Oh my God! How long have you been doing this?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5614","Robin","My Dad taught me to shoot when I was a kid. Now, whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here and it reminds me that... guns are fun!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5615","Marshall","Um, you know, Ted is kinda against guns.Robin (turning to Marshall, her gun still in her hand)  That's why Ted never gonna find out about this. Whoa! That sort of got scary with me holding a gun, didn't it? No, I just mean, please don't tell Ted. You wanna try?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5616","Marshall","Only hell, yes. Oh yeah, yeah. This is what I needed. I felt so powerless this whole time but this... This is power, this is... (He shoots and falls down)","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5617","Robin","I should have mention the recoil.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5618","Ted","I'll hand it to you. When he got home, Marshall was smiling. Did you sleep with him? 'Cause I was actually like three days away from suggesting that.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5619","Robin","Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side. (We see Marshall shooting and laughing maniacally )","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5620","Ted","Well, congratulations. You're the first person to cheer him up all summer. You win.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5621","Robin","Oh! What do I win?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5622","Ted","I'll tell what you win. I'm taking you away this weekend.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5623","Robin","You are? That's so nice!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5624","Ted","My aunt and uncle have a beach house at Montauk. It's really romantic. My uncle had, like, three affairs there.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5625","Robin","Wow, it must be a nice house. I saw pictures of your uncle. This is so great. We'll finally get some time alone. Are you sure Marshall is gonna be OK with this?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5626","Marshall","Yeah sure. Absolutely. Dude, I'm doing much better. In fact, take my car.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5627","Ted","Really? Hey, thanks. And hey, if you need anything, day or night, just call me. You know what? Please don't call me. What? What's wrong?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5628","Marshall","It's Lily's credit card bill. She must have forgotten to switch her address.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5629","Ted","So?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5630","Marshall","I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5631","Ted","No, no. No good can come from looking at this. You've made too much progress already.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5632","Marshall","I know, but I just...","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5633","Marshall","August 5, one charge - tickets. To what? George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars. August 10, one charge, Tennis Emporium. August 18, two charges. Mario's bistro and - get this - Pet Palace. You guys see what it means right?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5634","Lily","Wow, Mario's bistro. What a perfect place to whore around.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5635","George Clinton","Only the best for my little Lily Pad.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5636","Lily","Oh funk legend George Clinton, I am so glad you spotted me at your concert an drag me on stage to dance with you Courteney Cox style.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5637","George Clinton","I am so glad you agreed to play tennis with me.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5638","Lily","Oh you know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years but I didn't do it because I never truly loved him.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5639","George Clinton","I got you a gift.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5640","Lily","Oh! A ferret. I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace. I've always wanted one, but Marshall have this secret phobia of ferrets.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5641","George Clinton","I bet that's something he made you promise to tell nobody.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5642","Lily","It was! Oh, I love you funk legend George Clinton.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5643","George Clinton","I love you too, Lily. That's right Marshall, she's all mine. Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5644","Ted","That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5645","Robin","Yeah. Why are you afraid of ferrets, they are adorable.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5646","Marshall","Because, Robin, they are like fuzzy tube-shaped rats.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5647","Barney","Those charges are from a month ago.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5648","Ted","Exactly!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5649","Barney","For new charges, you have to go to her online account. You can see credit card activity from like two hours ago. But... You know... Don't... (Marshall leaves the bar, running).","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5650","Ted","Why do you talk? Why do you talk?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5651","Barney","He needs her password. Its not like he has her password. Ooh, he has her password. This is... He has her password.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5652","Marshall","There is a charge from earlier today. The Kellet Hotel, on Fifth. I don't believe this. Lily is back in New-York. (...) I can't believe this. Lily's in New-York? I guess I'd been thinking when she got back she's call me. That's the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5653","Robin (to Ted)","This has been holding in together?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5654","Marshall","OK, you know what? I'm calling her.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5655","Ted","No! You're not calling her. This changes nothing. (To Barney) You, come here. (Barney and Robin follow Ted in the kitchen). While we're away this weekend can you keep an eye on him? Make sure he doesn't call her hotel.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5656","Barney","You want me to baby-sit him? 20 bucks. An hour. And money for pizza.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5657","Ted","Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this. (To Robin) Come here my little baby. (Ted and Robin are making out)","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5658","Barney","OK, I'll do it! Stop being a couple.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5659","Robin","Marshall!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5660","Ted","Marshall! Marshall!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5661","Marshall","Ted, I know I shouldn't do this but I have to!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5662","Ted","Everything we've worked so hard for...!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5663","Marshall","Hello, Lily Aldrin's room please. Thank you.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5664","Ted","Hang up now!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5665","Marshall","Ted, I can't hang up now.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5666","Ted","Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5667","Marshall","Hello?! (He hangs up) A guy answered. There is... There is a guy in her room. I'm going down there.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5668","Barney","No!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5669","Ted","Dude, you can't...","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5670","Marshall","I have to go down there and I have to tell her I love her. I have to beg to take me back even if I have to tell on my knees.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5671","Robin","Marshall, you can't do that!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5672","Marshall","Really? Why not?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5673","Ted from 2030","56 days. That's how long it took me to get right about here.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5674","Ted","Because you're pathetic! I'm sorry. But right now, you are not Marshall. You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily. You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line? Marshall. The real Marshall. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5675","Barney","Bold. Bold to go for the car.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5676","Ted","What?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5677","Robin","I didn't say a thing.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5678","Ted","You think I was too hard on him.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5679","Robin","I didn't say a thing.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5680","Ted","I can't believe you're accusing me to be too hard on him. You're the one who said tough love.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5681","Robin","Yeah, tough love, not hand the guy a noose.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5682","Ted","Oh, but it's OK to hand him a 9 mm? Yeah. He told me. So you're a gun nut?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5683","Robin","No, I'm a gun enthusiast.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5684","Ted","Do you know how many people are killed...","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5685","Robin","The Second Amendment protects my right to bear arms...","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5686","Ted","Alright, alright. I was too hard on him.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5687","Robin","A little.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5688","Ted","I'm gonna call Barney, see how they're doing.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5689","Barney","Barney.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5690","Ted","Uh, hey. Where are you guys?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5691","Barney","We're at a fundraiser helping young women raise money for college.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5692","Ted","Strip-club. Nice. Is Marshall OK?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5693","Barney","Yeah, he's here and he's great. Hang on. Marshall, tell Ted... Uh-oh.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5694","Stripper","Already?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5695","Ted","What? What uh-oh?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5696","Barney","He's gone.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5697","Ted","You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5698","Barney","Crap, you're right. OK, here is the plan. Here is the plan. You go down to the hotel and find him. I'll stay here and get a lap dance. Bye Ted!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5699","Ted","Barney![End of the phone call]","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5700","Robin","Is there a hot tube at your uncle's place?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5701","Ted","A really nice one.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5702","Ted","Hi. Uh, could you tell me what room Lily Aldrin's in? Thanks. Marshall!","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5703","Marshall","Hey.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5704","Ted","What happened?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5705","Marshall","Well, I went up to Lily's floor...","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5706","Marshall","...and I had this little speech in my head. Everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect. I knocked on the door. (A man is opening the door and Marshall is punching him in the face).","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5707","Ted","You knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5708","Marshall","Yeah. It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5709","Ted","What? Who was he?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5710","Ted from 2030","His name was Joey Adalian. He went by a number of aliases as an identity thief. Apparently, earlier in the summer...","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5711","Lily","Oh, this is so embarrassing. I could've sworn I have some change. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Oh, here we go. No that's, that's a button... It was a button. Do you take credit cards?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5712","Waiter/Joey Adalian","Yes, I do.[End of flashback]","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5713","Ted","So Lily is not back in town and she doesn't have a boyfriend. That's good news, right?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5714","Marshall","Yeah. I don't know. Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her. I don't know where she is or what she's doing. She was my whole life man and now she's... She's gone.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5715","Ted","You know, first day at college, I showed up, I was so freaked out and I got up to my room and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall. He had headphones on, a big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap. Happy. Confident. Not afraid of anything. That guy was you. You before you met Lily.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5716","Marshall","Ted.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5717","Ted","Yeah.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5718","Marshall","I was high that day. I was. I was so high I thought you were the dean.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5719","Ted","What I'm saying is, there's a version of you without Lily and... It's not this. You can't let Lily stole your identity the way that guy stole hers.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5720","Marshall","OK.OK! Resolved. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being OK. Cheers.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5721","Ted","Cheers.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5722","DAY FIFTY-SEVEN, at the apartment.Ted from 2030","But it wasn't. 'cause that's no how life works. The next day he found one of her socks or something and we were back to square one. And then, one morning...","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5723","Robin","Ted. Ted you should see this.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5724","Ted","Oh, what now? Marshall? What are you doing?","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5725","Marshall","It's Sunday. It's pancakes day.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5726","Ted from 2030","It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes, but Marshall had come back from the dead. Because while baseball, strippers and guns can help, the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.","02","01","Where Were We?"
"5727","Ted from 2030","Marshall and Lily have together for nine wonderful years until she dumped him and ran off to San Francisco. The healing process was taking a long time. Then, one night he made a giant leap forward.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5728","Robin","Alright, see you guys later.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5729","Ted","I'll walk you out.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5730","Marshall","See ya.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5731","Barney","You just checked out Robin's ass.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5732","Marshall","What? No. I... Barney, I was...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5733","Barney","Dude, that's awesome! You're finally forgetting about that short redhead.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5734","Marshall","Lily.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5735","Barney","Yes, Lily, thank you. That was gonna drive me crazy all night. Hey, Ted! Marshall's just checked out your girlfriend's ass.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5736","Marshall","I did not Ted...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5737","Ted","Awesome! You're finally getting better.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5738","Barney","This is the moment I've been waiting for. Starting tonight, I'm gonna teach you how to live. Ted, you're out of chance, Marshall's in.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5739","Ted","Yes!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5740","Marshall","Oh, God!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5741","Barney","Marshall, being a single guy in New York city is like... Pfff... What does everybody like?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"

"5753","Marshall","Ted, what is wrong with you?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5754","Robin (on the phone)","He checked out my ass? Hey, tell him thanks. I felt like I was having a bad ass day. Cool. See ya.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5755","Robin","Lily.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5756","Lily","It is a great ass.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5757","Ted from 2030","None of us had seen Lily in three months. There were so many unanswered questions, so many things to say.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5758","Robin","Your hair is adorable!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5759","Lily","Thank you! (They hug)","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5760","At MacLaren's.Ted from 2030","Meanwhile, Barney was taking Marshall out to meet women for the first time since he was 17.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5761","Barney","Hi. Have you met Marshall?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5762","Woman","Hi.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5763","Marshall","Hi. Look how sweaty my hands are! It's weird, right? Uh, sweat. Like this... Smelly water coming out of your skin. It was nice meeting you.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5764","Barney","I-I-I Hate to interrupt but, uh... Do you like magic?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5765","Woman","Umm... I guess. (Barney makes a trick, Umm, I guess is writing on his hand). Oh my God! (Barney does it again, Oh my God! appears on his hand) Anyway, Marshall here is awesome. Salad in a bag? His idea!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5766","Barney","Dude, you were awesome last night. You were charming, you were funny. You were totally working that girl.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5767","Marshall","You went home with her!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5768","Barney","Yes, I did. But she told me that if it wasn't for me you would've had a shot with her. So in hypothetical terms, you scored last night! All right! Hypothetical high five! Nice! Tonight, we're gonna go to the bar...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5769","Marshall","Barney, no, I'm not going out with you ever again.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5770","Barney","Come on! I'll teach you all my strategies!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5771","Marshall","Oh, really?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5772","Barney","My favorite, number seven. Create a mystery about yourself. That way, they become so intrigued that they have to hang out with you all night.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5773","Marshall","Oh, come on. Does that really work?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5774","Barney","Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5775","Marshall","Dammit that's intriguing! OK, I'm in.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5776","Robin","You've gotta hear this.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5777","Ted","You will not believe what just happened.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5778","Robin","You go first.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5779","Ted","I find a 1939 penny on the subway. Just imagine the history this little copper guy's seen...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5780","Robin","Lily is back in town.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5781","Ted","And you let me go first?! Have you seen her?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5782","Robin","Uh, yeah. I actually went apartment hunting with her today.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5783","Ted","How is she doing?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5784","Robin","You're not gonna like it.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5785","Lily","I am doing great. This summer, best thing ever. San Francisco is so happening right now.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5786","Ted","She's happy? Marshall had the worst summer of his life and she's happy. And I suppose her art program was fulfilling or whatever.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5787","Lily","Oh, the art program, best thing ever.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5788","Man","Oh my God, this is your best work. In all my years teaching, I've never seen anything so... Needless to say, this is art! I can't teach you anything. (The man is giving Lily his paintbrush).","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5789","Lily","But the best part of SF - oh that's what we call San Francisco - the people. Even just riding around on the bus all summer, it was like a human tapestry.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5790","In San Francisco, in a bus.Man 1","Hi, I'm Mike. I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure writer travel.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5791","Woman","I'm Paula. I sing in a punk band for children. Yeah!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5792","Man 2","I'm Dan. I'm a neurosurgeon. You are stunning, by the way.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5793","Robin","Wow, I am so happy for you.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5794","Ted","Oh, she's such a... godda... God! After what she did to Marshall, she should come back here devastated. Crawling over the broken glass of her own shame and regret.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5795","Robin","You never chose sides. I respect that.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5796","Ted","She's unbelievable! Unbelievable!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5797","Marshall","Unbelievable? What's unbelievable?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5798","Ted","Uh, listen Marshall...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5799","Robin","Ted found a penny on the subway and it's old and that's interesting.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5800","Marshall","Way to go.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5801","Ted","OK, first of all, that is interesting. Second, we have to tell him.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5802","Robin","No, we don't. He's just starting to get better. Going out with Barney. How do you think he'll feel when he hears Lily's moved on?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5803","Ted","She's moved on?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5804","Robin","Well, it happens. I've fallen out of love faster than that before. Sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever. One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me. But we're great! Honey?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5805","Barney","Let's review Barney's rules for mating without dating. Lesson two  corollary five.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5806","Marshall","Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive and she'll be putty in your hands.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5807","Barney","Excellent. Have you chosen your entrée?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5808","Marshall","I have. A sweet brunette, eight o'clock. Nine o'clock. Ten; thirty. She's walking to the bar.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5809","Barney","Her? Really? No, you're right. Ambition is the enemy of success. OK, hit it.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5810","Marshall (to the girl)","Hey four-eyes. You got astigmatism or something? I'm sorry, I was trying to be playful but I just got out of a lonf relationship. I have no idea what I'm doing! I'm Marshall.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5811","Girl","Hi Marshall. Amy. Don't worry, I've been there. Hold on.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5812","Barney","Nice recovery. I think it's working.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5813","Marshall","Um, Amy, this is my friend Barney. Barney, this is Amy.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5814","Amy","Hey Barney, nice to meet you.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5815","Barney","Hi. Amy, do you like... magic?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5816","Marshall","I hate you.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5817","Barney","I am so sorry. It's a sickness. I'm the real victim here.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5818","Marshall","Twice! Twice in a row you took my candy! That was my candy!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5819","Barney","I know but tonight...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5820","Marshall","No, forget it. You're such a jackass!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5821","Barney (with you're a jerk writing on his hand)","I though you were gonna call me a jerk. All right, I'm sorry. But I will make it up to you. Tonight, we'll go to a college bar near NYU. The Scorpion & The Toad. I figure in a younger crowd you'll seem more mature, more worldly. And, as a third-year law student, more smarter.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5822","Marshall","OK, but no magic. (He turns to Barney who disappeared). How did you do that?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5823","Barney","I'm taking a leak, dumb-ass.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5824","In a building.Ted from 2030","Robin and I went apartment hunting with Aunt Lily.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5825","Lily","But I need the freedom to really chase my passion, which was painting but now, I think it's music, or spoken words. Maybe both. God, isn't life amazing.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5826","Ted","Yeah.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5827","Lily","It is so great to see you Ted. Ah! I'm gonna get the key for the lockbox.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5828","Robin","What?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5829","Ted","She's miserable. She's realized she's made a huge mistake. Her and Marshall will be back together in a week, I love it!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5830","Robin","No, you just want Lily to be miserable. The truth is she's happy.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5831","Ted","Trust me. I've known Lily for nine years.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5832","Robin","Trust me, I'm a girl!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5833","Ted","Yeah. But you're Canadian.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5834","Robin","Why do you always have to bring that up?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5835","Ted","You're our weird neighbors!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5836","Robin","You bring it up every time...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5837","Ted","No, alright. Five bucks says she still wants Marshall.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5838","Robin","You're on.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5839","Ted","Five American bucks.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5840","Robin","Dammit! OK, so how do we get the truth out of her?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5841","Ted","Tequila. It's her weakness. Three shots, she tells you the truth about anything.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5842","Barney","Marshall Eriksen, suit up!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5843","Marshall","No way.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5844","Barney","Yeah you're good in that. Let's go.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5845","Marshall","Wait. Empty your pockets. Come on.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5846","Barney","Come on...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5847","Marshall","Sleeves.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5848","Barney","There is nothing in my sl...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5849","Marshall","Oh is that right?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5850","Barney","Huh? Huh? Let's go.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5851","Marshall","Behind my ear.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5852","Barney","Oh there is nothing behind your... Ohh!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5853","Marshall","Ohh!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5854","Girl","Yeah, I'm in pre-law. The workload's killing me though.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5855","Marshall","Oh, tell me about it. I'm a third year at Columbia Law, so... If the workload does kill you I can probably get a conviction. Yeah.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5856","In an other spot of the Scorpion & the Toad.Barney (to a girl)","You must be majoring in chemistry 'cause what I'm picking up between us is, uh... (The girl leaves / to the girl's friend) College lesbian phase.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5857","Girl","Listen, I gotta go. But it'd be great to see you again.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5858","Marshall","Yes, it would. It really would.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5859","Girl","Maybe I'll see you here sometimes.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5860","Marshall","Probably not. I'm never here, so...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5861","Girl","You know, I do have a phone number.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5862","Marshall","Great. Nice.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5863","Barney","Hi, I'm Barney.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5864","Marshall","Oh, no.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5865","Barney","Do you mind giving my friend your phone number?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5866","Girl","Sure.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5867","Marshall","Whoo! I did it! I got a girl's phone number! Oh, and her handwriting is so cute. Look. I'll take her out for Chinese food and then we'll walk through the park. It'll be so... What?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5868","Barney","Sorry buddy, I'm taking this one too.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5869","Marshall (choking Barney)","I'll kill you!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5870","Lily","And then I discovered this area, North beach. Best beach ever! Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer. How are you guys doing? And hey, how is Marshall?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5871","Marshall","Gimme the card! I swear I'm gonna...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5872","Barney","I'm not giving you...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5873","Ted","Terrific.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5874","Lily","That is so good to hear. (Lily's phone rings). Oh, hold on. This could be about he apartment. (She leaves the room).","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5875","Ted","OK, we're way past truth-telling Lily and about to hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998 Lily, and I'm not cleaning that up again. So, congratulations. You win, she's happy.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5876","Lily","I didn't get it. That first apartment. I... I waited too long and somebody else got it. (She starts crying).","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5877","Ted","Interesting. Wow Lily, you, uh, seem to be having a pretty strong reaction to losing this apartment. I wonder is it because it reminds you of something you lost because you couldn't commit?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5878","Robin","No, Lily you're crying over the crown moulding and the real hardwood floor. There's no deeper meaning, right Lily? Just quit crying and tell him.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5879","Lily","The apartment is a metaphor for Marshall! (Robin gives back Ted his five dollars)","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5880","Barney","Stop it!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5881","Marshall","You don't want to see me when I'm angry!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5882","Barney","Stop! If we can't settle this like gentlemen, then no one gets the number. (He sends the card across the window).","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5883","Marshall","Stop the cab! (Marshall gets out of the car)","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5884","Barney","No, wait. Come on. Wait. Marshall! 81st and 1st please. (He pulls the card out of his sleeve). Oh, she does have a cute handwriting.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5885","In a snack-bar.Ted from 2030","About hangovers - everyone has their own special remedy.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5886","Waiter","Morning guys, what can I get you?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5887","Lily","Shhh! Bring me the dirtiest, greasiest tuna melt you got. And a milkshake.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5888","Waiter","For you, sir?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5889","Ted","Gravy.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5890","Waiter","You want that gravy on something?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5891","Ted","Surprise me.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5892","Robin","I'd take you with gravy if my boyfriend wasn't sitting right here! Just kidding. I'm good.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5893","Lily","What are you charpy about?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5894","Ted","She's still drunk from last night.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5895","Robin","I don't think so! Whoo!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5896","Ted","Look, if you want Marshall back so bad, how come it took you two days to ask about him?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5897","Lily","I was dying to ask. I was just trying to play it cool. But really...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5898","Robin","But it's good, I mean work's great...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5899","Lily","Say something about Marshall. Where is Marshall? How's Marshall? What's Marshall doing right now? (They are now with Ted in an other building) Shut up and talk about Marshall. Shut up and talk about Marshall! Shut up and talk about Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Aaah I gotta ask! (Then, the three of them are in Robin's apartment) And, hey, how is Marshall?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5900","Lily","It was such an awful summer! I just wanted to get back here and see him.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5901","Ted","But I thought your summer was great?!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5902","Lily","Not exactly...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5903","Man","Oh my God! This is your best work?! In all my years teaching I've never seen something so... needless. To say this is art... I can't teach you anything.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5904","Ted","So all those interesting people you met on the bus...?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5905","Lily","Yeah, um...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5906","Man","I'm Mike. I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure writer travel.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5907","Lily","I never got in touch because I was too embarrassed. I screwed everything up. I have no job, no place to live. I lost the love of my life. Look, I know I have no right to ask this but do you think Marshall would take me back?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5908","Ted","In a heartbeat. If you called him up, yeah, he'd take you back with open arms.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5909","Lily","Wow. So, maybe I should call him?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5910","Ted","Maybe. No! This is... Ooww... Hold on. Look. If you're gonna go back to him, I don't wanna hear the word ""maybe"". ""Maybe"" cannot be in your vocabulary. This break-up almost killed him. And he cannot go through it again. So, unless you're absolutely certain, stay the hell away from him.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5911","Robin (laughing)","This guy like pennies!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5912","Barney","Hi Marshall.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5913","Marshall","No, go away, I don't want to talk to you.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5914","Barney","OK. I know what I did a couple nights back was is in a moral grey area. But the great news is she loved you. If things had gone your way, you'd gone out a couple time, I think she definitely would've had s*x with you.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5915","Marshall","There is no ""would"" in s*x. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5916","Barney","You can't give up now. What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes, only this time you get her and I don't.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5917","Marshall","That's not possible.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5918","Barney","Oh, but it is. She has... Wait for it. Here it comes. Almost there...an identical twin. Yes!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5919","Marshall","A twin isn't the same person.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5920","Barney","Of course, it is. What do you think ""identical"" means? ""Ident-"" - same. ""-ical"" - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5921","Marshall","Fine.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5922","Barney","Ah!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5923","Marshall","But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5924","Barney","Used-up? They're a human being Marshall.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5925","Ted from 2030","So Uncle Marshall and Uncle Barney went out on a double date with the twins.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5926","Barney","How are you doing?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5927","Marshall","Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5928","Barney","You are. You definitely are. Listen, you're gonna have to leave now. I just talked with the twins and, get this, I'm going home with both of them! Yeah. That's happening.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5929","Marshall","It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5930","Barney","But they're twins.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5931","Marshall","You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5932","Barney","Well, it's not like a candy store. It's a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. I may be your best friend...","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5933","Marshall","Ted's my best friend.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5934","Barney","...but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is. And after nine years of captivity, that is the single greatest lesson I can teach you about surviving in the wild. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have two unique breasts an two duplicates waiting for me. (Barney rejoins the twins, Marshall leaves the bar). Oh bad news. Marshall got food poisoning.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5935","Twin 1","What?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5936","Twin 2","That's so bad. I really liked him.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5937","Barney","Yeah. I guess we're just a threesome tonight.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5938","Marshall","Lily. What are you doing here?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5939","Lily","Oh, I-I was just walking by. I wasn't... Oh, you mean, New-York? My program ended. It was just great. Just lots of fun. It was awful. It was the worst mistake I ever made. I'm so sorry Marshall. And, hello.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5940","Marshall","Lily, this was the worst summer of my life.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5941","Lily","I know. It was the worst summer of my life.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5942","Marshall","It was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5943","Lily","Can we please get back together?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5944","Marshall","All that crap you said to me about ""we need to figure out who we are outside of us, and we need to learn to do things on our own."". It broke my heart. Three months ago, you broke my heart.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5945","Lily","Can we please get back together?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5946","Marshall","Lily, you were right. All that crap was right. So, no. No, we can't get back together. We shouldn't. At least, not right now.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5947","Lily","Wow. OK. Yeah. Wi... Will we still see each other?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5948","Marshall","Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I don't know. This is all really new to me. I just got out of a long relationship. I like your hair.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5949","Lily","Thanks. I, uh, figured, new city, new color - uh, old color. (Music 'It's gonna be different this time' / Later). And the pizza there. Worst pizza ever! I'm so glad to be back in New-York.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5950","Marshall","Yeah.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5951","Lily","Listen, if there is anything I can do to even begin to make things up to you.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5952","Marshall","Actually, there's maybe something you can do for me. But you can never ever ask me why.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5953","Barney","So then, I was promoted to assistant ménage-er. Manager. Why do I keep doing that? (Lily arrives.) Lily?","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5954","Lily","You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk! (She throws a drink at his face and leaves)","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5955","Barney","So, where was I? Ah yes. Assistant ménage-er. I did it again. I can't believe it!","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5956","Lily","You gave my twin sister Chlamydia! You slime! (She throws a second drink at his face and leaves, following by the twins).","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5957","Barney","Wait, wait, I know magic. Well played, Eriksen. Well played.","02","02","The Scorpion and the Toad"
"5958","Ted","Kids you know that photo in the den? It was taken back in 2006, when Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me and we all went out to brunch. We all look pretty happy, right? Wrong.","02","03","Brunch"
"5959","Lily","I wish your face would melt off.","02","03","Brunch"
"5960","Marshall","I wish your eyeballs would explode.","02","03","Brunch"
"5961","Lily","I hate you.","02","03","Brunch"
"5962","Marshall","I hate you more.","02","03","Brunch"
"5963","Ted","I'm going to kill him.","02","03","Brunch"
"5964","Barney","I can't say I blame you.","02","03","Brunch"
"5965","Ted","No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him.","02","03","Brunch"
"5966","Robin","I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.","02","03","Brunch"
"5967","Ted's mother","Not now.","02","03","Brunch"
"5968","Robin","Okay, if you don't, I will.","02","03","Brunch"
"5969","Ted's mother","Robin...! (She lifts her arm and hits the waitress who falls down.)","02","03","Brunch"
"5970","Ted from 2030","Okay, for any of this to make sense, you got to understand, there are three parts to this story. Let's start with the Marshall and Lily part.","02","03","Brunch"
"5971","The previous day, at the apartment.Ted from 2030","As a 30th anniversary gift, I had flown my parents to New York for the weekend.","02","03","Brunch"
"5972","Ted's mother","Oh, I forgot to tell you, your cousin Jimmy had a wonderful time at that spa he visited.","02","03","Brunch"
"5973","Ted","You mean the spa the judge ordered him to go to to quit cocaine?","02","03","Brunch"
"5974","Ted's mother","Coffee?","02","03","Brunch"
"5975","Ted from 2030","You know, Grandma and Grandpa didn't like to talk about things that were uncomfortable, emotional, or in any way... real.","02","03","Brunch"
"5976","Lily","Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.","02","03","Brunch"
"5977","Ted's father","Oh, Lily! Hi, Marshall.","02","03","Brunch"
"5978","Marshall","Good to see you.","02","03","Brunch"
"5979","Lily","I was just stopping by to pick up some of my things.","02","03","Brunch"
"5980","Ted's mother","Yes, we were so sorry to hear about your... You know, the, the... Well...","02","03","Brunch"
"5981","Marshall","Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?","02","03","Brunch"
"5982","Lily","Me begging Marshall to take me back and him rejecting me?","02","03","Brunch"
"5983","Ted's mother","I love your hair.","02","03","Brunch"
"5984","Ted from 2030","This was only the second time Marshall and Lily had seen each other since breaking up, but to their credit, it wasn't that awkward.","02","03","Brunch"
"5985","Marshall","Actually, we're cool. We just divided up CDs. It was all very civil. I'm proud of us. Wwe're, we're good.","02","03","Brunch"
"5986","Ted's mother","Well, we were all going to go to Casa a Pezzi at 8 00. Lily, would you like to join us?","02","03","Brunch"
"5987","Lily (looking at Marshall)","Um...","02","03","Brunch"
"5988","Marshall","What?","02","03","Brunch"
"5989","Lily","Well, I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable.","02","03","Brunch"
"5990","Marshall","Why would it?","02","03","Brunch"
"5991","Lily","Well, I mean, yeah, we're... We're good, but you got to admit there's that stuff between us.","02","03","Brunch"
"5992","Marshall","Um, not for me. Now it's just like we're friends. It's like we're brother and sister.","02","03","Brunch"
"5993","Lily","""Brother and sister""?! Okay. Fine, yeah, I'll see you at the restaurant, bro. (She leaves)","02","03","Brunch"
"5994","Ted from 2030","See? Not awkward at all.","02","03","Brunch"
"5995","Lily","Hello, everyone.","02","03","Brunch"
"5996","All","Hi.","02","03","Brunch"
"5997","Lily","Hello, Marshall.","02","03","Brunch"
"5998","Ted's mother","Lily, that is a stunning dress.","02","03","Brunch"
"5999","Lily","Oh, thanks. It's kind of revealing, but I thought, ""Hey, we're all family."" Right, bro? Ooh, ah...","02","03","Brunch"
"6000","Ted","What's wrong?","02","03","Brunch"
"6001","Lily","Oh, I, I hurt my ankle in yoga today. The instructor told me to just take deep breaths to get through the pain, just... (She breathes deeply while Marshall glances at her low neckline) Are you all right? You're kind of sweating.","02","03","Brunch"
"6002","Marshall","No, I'm fine. It's just... This roll is really spicy.","02","03","Brunch"
"6003","Marshall","Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to torture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too.","02","03","Brunch"
"6004","Barney","Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch.","02","03","Brunch"
"6005","Marshall","No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves.","02","03","Brunch"
"6006","Barney","That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.","02","03","Brunch"
"6007","Marshall","Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs.","02","03","Brunch"
"6008","Barney","I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.","02","03","Brunch"
"6009","Ted from 2030","So Marshall showed up at brunch with a plan.","02","03","Brunch"
"6010","Marshall","Hello.","02","03","Brunch"
"6011","Ted's father","Oh, hi.","02","03","Brunch"
"6012","Ted","Hey, Marshall.","02","03","Brunch"
"6013","Robin","Hey.","02","03","Brunch"
"6014","Lily","Hey. How are you feeling? You looked kind of feverish last night.","02","03","Brunch"
"6015","Marshall","Oh, no, I actually feel great. It is kind of warm in here, though, isn't it?","02","03","Brunch"
"6016","Lily","Oh, I don't know, if anything, it's kind of... (Marshall starts unzipping his knee zips) What are you doing?","02","03","Brunch"
"6017","Marshall","Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just making myself feel a little bit more... comfortable. (He starts massaging his calve) Oh. Oh, yes. I've been doing all these toe lifts lately, and so... My calves have really been cramping up.","02","03","Brunch"
"6018","Marshall","Take off your dress.","02","03","Brunch"
"6019","Lily","Take off the rest of your pants.","02","03","Brunch"
"6020","Lily","I really wasn't expecting that to happen.","02","03","Brunch"
"6021","Marshall","Yeah, me neither. It kind of complicates things, doesn't it?","02","03","Brunch"
"6022","Lily","Yeah, it does. Why did you have to throw your magnificent calves at me? You know you have a punter's leg.","02","03","Brunch"
"6023","Marshall","Well, why did you have to throw your beautiful boobs at me? You know you have... boobs.","02","03","Brunch"
"6024","Lily","Just admit it, you came here trying to seduce me.","02","03","Brunch"
"6025","Marshall","Seduce you? You seduced me.","02","03","Brunch"
"6026","Lily","You sat down next to me and took most of your pants off.","02","03","Brunch"
"6027","Marshall","You went to San Francisco for three months.","02","03","Brunch"
"6028","Lily","How is that seducing you?","02","03","Brunch"
"6029","Marshall","Well, it's not but I'm still mad about it.","02","03","Brunch"
"6030","Lily","All right, that's it - I want The Beatles Anthology.","02","03","Brunch"
"6031","Marshall","Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm keeping it! And you know the U2 box set I gave you? Look inside - all Dave Matthews.","02","03","Brunch"
"6032","Lily","You are evil.","02","03","Brunch"
"6033","The waitress (taking a photo)","Smile!","02","03","Brunch"
"6034","Ted","I'm going to kill him.","02","03","Brunch"
"6035","Barney","I can't say I blame you.","02","03","Brunch"
"6036","Ted","No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him.","02","03","Brunch"
"6037","Ted from 2030","Now let's talk about the Barney part of the story.","02","03","Brunch"
"6038","The previous day, at the apartment.Ted from 2030","This was going to be Robin's first time meeting my parents, so we were both a little nervous.","02","03","Brunch"
"6039","Ted","Barney, what are you doing here?","02","03","Brunch"
"6040","Barney","Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them.","02","03","Brunch"
"6041","Ted","I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories.","02","03","Brunch"
"6042","Barney","What?","02","03","Brunch"
"6043","Ted","Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about  baseball.","02","03","Brunch"
"6044","Barney","But I'm your best friend.","02","03","Brunch"
"6045","Ted","Well, actually Marshall's my...","02","03","Brunch"
"6046","Barney","I'm the most important person in your life.","02","03","Brunch"
"6047","Ted","Well, Robin's actually...","02","03","Brunch"
"6048","Barney","How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful.","02","03","Brunch"
"6049","Robin","To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have.","02","03","Brunch"
"6050","Barney","Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today.","02","03","Brunch"
"6051","Ted","Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.","02","03","Brunch"
"6052","Ted's father","Ted.","02","03","Brunch"
"6053","Ted","I know you've all been excited to meet...","02","03","Brunch"
"6054","Barney","Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you. That needlepoint ""Bless This Mess"" pillow you made for Ted - what a stitch. Stitch! Did that just happen? (Ted's parents and Barney laugh)","02","03","Brunch"
"6055","Ted","Uh, Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend, Robin.","02","03","Brunch"
"6056","Ted's father","Hello.","02","03","Brunch"
"6057","Robin","Hello.","02","03","Brunch"
"6058","Ted's mother","Oh, it's wonderful to meet you, Robin. Oh, you are so pretty. Isn't she pretty, Al?","02","03","Brunch"
"6059","Ted's father","A real looker.","02","03","Brunch"
"6060","Robin","That's funny, I didn't even ""look"" in the mirror today. That's not anything, is it? So, I made a reservation at San Marino tonight for 8 00.","02","03","Brunch"
"6061","Barney (laughing)","San Marino! Oh, you're serious? Yikes. No. We have to try Casa A Pezzi. Best salmon risotto I have ever had.","02","03","Brunch"
"6062","Ted's mother","I love salmon risotto.","02","03","Brunch"
"6063","Barney","I know.","02","03","Brunch"
"6064","Robin","How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.","02","03","Brunch"
"6065","Barney","Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because...","02","03","Brunch"
"6066","Ted","Stop it! Don't, don't!","02","03","Brunch"
"6067","Barney","Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin?","02","03","Brunch"
"6068","Robin","What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass.","02","03","Brunch"
"6069","Barney","Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five!","02","03","Brunch"
"6070","Ted's mother","Can I help?","02","03","Brunch"
"6071","Barney","Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it.","02","03","Brunch"
"6072","Ted's mother","Well, funny you should ask...","02","03","Brunch"
"6073","At ""Casa a pezzi"". Barney is playing the piano.Ted's father","Whoa! Bravo, Barney. Oh, oh oh!","02","03","Brunch"
"6074","Ted's mother","That is my all-time favorite sonata.Barney, you are just delightful.","02","03","Brunch"
"6075","Barney","No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening.","02","03","Brunch"
"6076","Lily","Whoops. I think I dropped an ice cube down here. Ow, it's so cold.","02","03","Brunch"
"6077","Marshall","All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute.","02","03","Brunch"
"6078","Barney","Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's?","02","03","Brunch"
"6079","Robin","No, I'm kind of tired.","02","03","Brunch"
"6080","Lily","Me, too.","02","03","Brunch"
"6081","Ted","Yeah, I'm sure my folks are gonna want...","02","03","Brunch"
"6082","Ted's father","I feel like I could knock back a few cervezas.","02","03","Brunch"
"6083","Ted","Cervezas? Did he fall?","02","03","Brunch"
"6084","Ted's mother","I'd join you, too, but I want to get up early for Mass tomorrow.","02","03","Brunch"
"6085","Barney","St. Peter's, 8 45 a.m., it's my favorite service.","02","03","Brunch"
"6086","Ted","Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?","02","03","Brunch"
"6087","Barney","I'll save you a seat.","02","03","Brunch"
"6088","Ted's mother","Oh, you are just terrific. Isn't he, Susan?","02","03","Brunch"
"6089","Robin","Robin.","02","03","Brunch"
"6090","Barney","Susan, her name is Virginia.","02","03","Brunch"
"6091","Barney","Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now.","02","03","Brunch"
"6092","Ted","Why?","02","03","Brunch"
"6093","Barney","Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?","02","03","Brunch"
"6094","Ted's father (talking to a girl)","So Barney darts back into the burning house, lifts up the refrigerator I'm pinned under and pulls me to safety.","02","03","Brunch"
"6095","Girl","Wow. You're like a hero.","02","03","Brunch"
"6096","Barney","Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry.","02","03","Brunch"
"6097","Girl","You poor, brave man.","02","03","Brunch"
"6098","Ted's father","Why don't you give the guy a hug?","02","03","Brunch"
"6099","Barney","I'm... oh. (They hug).","02","03","Brunch"
"6100","Ted","My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool?","02","03","Brunch"
"6101","Barney","I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom.","02","03","Brunch"
"6102","Ted","Sure.","02","03","Brunch"
"6103","Barney","Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back...","02","03","Brunch"
"6104","Ted","Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God!","02","03","Brunch"
"6105","Barney","I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?","02","03","Brunch"
"6106","Ted","My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible.","02","03","Brunch"
"6107","Barney","Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side.","02","03","Brunch"
"6108","Ted","Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use ""83%""?","02","03","Brunch"
"6109","Barney","You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people at www.swingers.open-marriage-is-natural-legalize-polygamy.org have, and they beg to differ.","02","03","Brunch"
"6110","Ted","That's not a real Web site.","02","03","Brunch"
"6111","Barney","Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real T-shirt for running in their 10K.","02","03","Brunch"
"6112","Ted","Hi, Dad.","02","03","Brunch"
"6113","Ted's father","Hey, Ted. Barney!","02","03","Brunch"
"6114","Ted","Enjoying your vacation so far?","02","03","Brunch"
"6115","Ted's father","Oh, yeah.","02","03","Brunch"
"6116","Ted","Uh, listen, can I speak to you outside for a sec?","02","03","Brunch"
"6117","Ted's father","Sure.","02","03","Brunch"
"6118","Ted","So you went out with Barney last night?","02","03","Brunch"
"6119","Ted's father","Yeah.","02","03","Brunch"
"6120","Ted","You have a good time?","02","03","Brunch"
"6121","Ted's father","Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry you couldn't join us.","02","03","Brunch"
"6122","Ted","Yeah. So...","02","03","Brunch"
"6123","Ted's father","What?","02","03","Brunch"
"6124","Ted","Well...","02","03","Brunch"
"6125","Ted's father","Well what?","02","03","Brunch"
"6126","Ted","You think Cerrano's got a shot at the RBI title?","02","03","Brunch"
"6127","Ted","I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't. I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about-anything-uncomfortable gene","02","03","Brunch"
"6128","Barney","Well, you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene, that's for sure.","02","03","Brunch"
"6129","The waitress (taking a photo)","Smile!","02","03","Brunch"
"6130","Robin","I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.","02","03","Brunch"
"6131","Ted's mother","Not now.","02","03","Brunch"
"6132","Robin","Okay, if you don't, I will.","02","03","Brunch"
"6133","Ted's mother","Robin...! (She lifts her arm and hits the waitress who falls down.)","02","03","Brunch"
"6134","Ted from 2030","Okay, now I got to back up all the way to the beginning to tell you the me and Robin part of the story.","02","03","Brunch"
"6135","Ted from 2030","We were expecting my parents at any minute.","02","03","Brunch"
"6136","Ted","One last thing about my mom. She grills every single one of my girlfriends about when we're gonna get married and have kids.","02","03","Brunch"
"6137","Robin","But this is the first time she's meeting me.","02","03","Brunch"
"6138","Ted","Doesn't matter. And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin Stacy  six kids in five years. The woman's basically a ride at a water park.","02","03","Brunch"
"6139","Robin","But I don't want to get married and have kids. What am I supposed to say?","02","03","Brunch"
"6140","Ted","You know what? You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions. You shouldn't have to apologize for them.","02","03","Brunch"
"6141","Robin","I'm gonna lie.","02","03","Brunch"
"6142","Ted","I would.","02","03","Brunch"
"6143","Lily","Thanks again for letting me have the U2 box set.","02","03","Brunch"
"6144","Marshall","I know how important it is to you.","02","03","Brunch"
"6145","Ted's mother","I talked to Aunt Caroline the other day. Stacy's pregnant again.","02","03","Brunch"
"6146","Ted","Oh, good for her.","02","03","Brunch"
"6147","Ted's mother (to Robin)","So, dear...","02","03","Brunch"
"6148","Robin","Oh, boy.","02","03","Brunch"
"6149","Ted's mother","Tell us what it's like being a journalist.","02","03","Brunch"
"6150","Robin","I'm just not ready.","02","03","Brunch"
"6151","Ted's mother","Okay. No pressure.","02","03","Brunch"
"6152","Robin","Oh. Uh, I thought you, um... It's great.","02","03","Brunch"
"6153","Ted's mother","Good. Focus on your job now, because your career clock is ticking. There's time for marriage and kids and all that other stuff later.","02","03","Brunch"
"6154","Barney","Ooh, a piano!","02","03","Brunch"
"6155","Ted","You lucked out with my mom last night, huh? What a relief, right?","02","03","Brunch"
"6156","Robin","Oh, absolutely. Whew, what a relief it is to know I'm the one girlfriend your mom doesn't want you to have kids with.","02","03","Brunch"
"6157","Ted","Hooray?","02","03","Brunch"
"6158","Robin","I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl would pop out attractive children? 'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry, that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman.","02","03","Brunch"
"6159","Ted","Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important.","02","03","Brunch"
"6160","Barney","What happened to Marshall and Lily?","02","03","Brunch"
"6161","Ted","They've been fighting lately. They're probably off somewhere going at it.","02","03","Brunch"
"6162","Waitress","More coffee?","02","03","Brunch"
"6163","Ted's mother","Oh, no, thank you. Isn't she sweet?","02","03","Brunch"
"6164","Robin","Well, if she's so sweet, maybe she should have Ted's babies.","02","03","Brunch"
"6165","Ted's mother","Excuse me?","02","03","Brunch"
"6166","Robin","Nothing. (She leaves the table to go to the bathroom, the door is locked, she knocks.)","02","03","Brunch"
"6167","Lily","Just a minute.","02","03","Brunch"
"6168","Marshall","Maybe less.","02","03","Brunch"
"6169","Ted's mother","Robin, dear, did I say something to upset you?","02","03","Brunch"
"6170","Robin","Why don't you want me to have your grandkids?","02","03","Brunch"
"6171","Ted's mother","Do you want to have my grandkids?","02","03","Brunch"
"6172","Robin","No! I mean, I don't know. I just... I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids. And you should. I'm a genetic gold mine. No family history of diabetes or heart disease. Everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight. I had one schizophrenic uncle but even he had perfect vision. Which was unfortunate for the people around the bell tower he was in, but still he was a very fine man, and...","02","03","Brunch"
"6173","Marshall","Excuse me. Sorry. Didn't know that there was a line.","02","03","Brunch"
"6174","Lily","Marshall, your zipper.","02","03","Brunch"
"6175","Ted's mother","Robin, it's not that I don't want grandkids. It's just I don't think anyone should make the mistake of getting married too young.","02","03","Brunch"
"6176","Robin","Why do you say that? I mean, you got married pretty young. That wasn't a mistake. Was it?","02","03","Brunch"
"6177","Ted's mother","Well... Okay, there's something you don't know...","02","03","Brunch"
"6178","Waitress","Smile!","02","03","Brunch"
"6179","Lily","I wish your face would melt off.","02","03","Brunch"
"6180","Marshall","I wish your eyeballs would explode.","02","03","Brunch"
"6181","Ted","I'm gonna kill him.","02","03","Brunch"
"6182","Robin","I don't care how unpleasant it is, you have to talk to him.","02","03","Brunch"
"6183","Ted's mother","Not now.","02","03","Brunch"
"6184","Robin","Okay, if you don't, I will.","02","03","Brunch"
"6185","Ted's mother","Robin...! (She lifts her arm and hits the waitress who falls down.)","02","03","Brunch"
"6186","Ted's father","Oh, gosh, let me help you pick those up, sweetheart.","02","03","Brunch"
"6187","Ted","Sweetheart? Sweetheart?! The only sweetheart in your life should be the woman you married 30 years ago, not the waitress at the bar last night and not this clumsy floozy! (To the waitress) I'm sorry, you're not a floozy. I'm upset, I don't know what I'm saying. But stay away from my dad.","02","03","Brunch"
"6188","Ted's mother","Ted, what are you talking about?","02","03","Brunch"
"6189","Ted","Dad? You, uh, want to tell Mom what happened at the bar last night?","02","03","Brunch"
"6190","Ted's father","Okay. I hooked up with a waitress.","02","03","Brunch"
"6191","Ted's mother","Oh.","02","03","Brunch"
"6192","Ted","Oh?","02","03","Brunch"
"6193","Ted's mother","I mean, oh! Oh! Ooh! We're going to have a serious talk about this when we get home, Al. Oh, ooh!","02","03","Brunch"
"6194","Ted","Serious talk? Mom, what...? He was kissing another woman. Don't you care?","02","03","Brunch"
"6195","Robin","Mrs. Mosby?","02","03","Brunch"
"6196","Ted's mother","Ted, we weren't quite sure how to tell you this...","02","03","Brunch"
"6197","Ted's father","Your mother and I are divorced.","02","03","Brunch"
"6198","Ted","What do you mean you're divorced? Since when?","02","03","Brunch"
"6199","Ted's mother","Oh, gosh, it's been about nine months now.","02","03","Brunch"
"6200","Ted's father","Closer to ten, I think.","02","03","Brunch"
"6201","Ted's mother","Time flies.","02","03","Brunch"
"6202","Ted","So ten months ago, you just up and decided to get divorced without telling me?","02","03","Brunch"
"6203","Ted's mother","No, it wasn't a snap decision.","02","03","Brunch"
"6204","Ted's father","We'd been separated almost two years.","02","03","Brunch"
"6205","Ted","How could you not tell me this?!","02","03","Brunch"
"6206","Ted's mother","We meant to, it just never seemed like the right time.","02","03","Brunch"
"6207","Ted","So last Christmas...?","02","03","Brunch"
"6208","Ted's father","We talked about telling you kids then, but it didn't seem very Christmasy.","02","03","Brunch"
"6209","Ted","I got you a tandem bike.","02","03","Brunch"
"6210","Ted's father","Oh, it didn't go to waste. Your mother and Frank ride it all the time.","02","03","Brunch"
"6211","Ted","Who the hell is Frank?!","02","03","Brunch"
"6212","Ted's father","Oh, great guy. I actually set them up. You remember Dr. Muchnik. He did your braces.","02","03","Brunch"
"6213","Ted","Okay, my head's about to explode, and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles, so I am leaving. (He leaves, following by his parents and Robin)","02","03","Brunch"
"6214","Ted's mother","Teddy bear, oh...","02","03","Brunch"
"6215","Barney","You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that. Ooh, no line at the omelet station.","02","03","Brunch"
"6216","Marshall","Lily... I'm sorry that I said all those things.","02","03","Brunch"
"6217","Lily","Me, too.","02","03","Brunch"
"6218","Marshall","I just find it really confusing to be around you right now.","02","03","Brunch"
"6219","Lily","It's the same for me. I think we're probably both better off trying to keep some distance for a while.","02","03","Brunch"
"6220","Marshall","Yeah, I think you're right. Are you wearing a push-up bra?","02","03","Brunch"
"6221","Lily","Did you Mystic Tan your calves?","02","03","Brunch"
"6222","Marshall","I withdraw the question.","02","03","Brunch"
"6223","Outside.Ted's father","We're sorry we didn't say anything about the divorce.","02","03","Brunch"
"6224","Ted's mother","It was wrong not to tell you.","02","03","Brunch"
"6225","Ted","Thank you.","02","03","Brunch"
"6226","Ted's father","But listen, don't tell your sister.","02","03","Brunch"
"6227","Ted's mother","It would just upset her.","02","03","Brunch"
"6228","Ted","No, this is ridiculous! We have to start talking about stuff, and not just baseball.","02","03","Brunch"
"6229","Ted's father","Indians won today on a walk-off double.","02","03","Brunch"
"6230","Ted","Against the Red Sox? Boy, that's a big win. No. No. No. We're not gonna blow past this. I mean, I don't even know who you people. I don't even know how you met.","02","03","Brunch"
"6231","Ted's father","I never told you how I met your mother?","02","03","Brunch"
"6232","Ted","No.","02","03","Brunch"
"6233","Ted's father","Oh, great story. At a bar.","02","03","Brunch"
"6234","Ted","That's it? That's what passes for communication in our family? Man, when I have kids, and I tell them how I met their mother, I'm gonna tell them everything, the whole damn story.","02","03","Brunch"
"6235","Ted's father","I think it was an Irish bar.","02","03","Brunch"
"6236","Ted","I just, I don't... I don't understand. You seemed so happy. When I was growing up, you seemed so... What happened?","02","03","Brunch"
"6237","Ted's father","We just realized we're very different people.","02","03","Brunch"
"6238","Ted's mother","Your father's kind of a head-in-the-clouds romantic, and I'm much more down to earth.","02","03","Brunch"
"6239","Ted","So? Robin and I are like that. That doesn't mean anything.","02","03","Brunch"
"6240","Ted's father","I wanted kids. And your mother... also wanted kids.","02","03","Brunch"
"6241","Ted","Robin and I have different views on families. We're not about to break up because of it.","02","03","Brunch"
"6242","Ted's mother","On some level, I always knew. I didn't even want to go out with him in the beginning. But he spent months badgering me until I finally gave in.","02","03","Brunch"
"6243","Ted's father","Well, when you don't connect on that many fundamental levels, it's only a matter of time before you realize you're not meant to be together.","02","03","Brunch"
"6244","Ted's mother","But we love Robin.","02","03","Brunch"
"6245","Ted's father","Absolutely. Meeting you was the highlight of my trip. Well, second highlight.","02","03","Brunch"
"6246","Ted's mother","We'll see you inside.","02","03","Brunch"
"6247","Ted's father","Sorry.","02","03","Brunch"
"6248","Robin","Wow.","02","03","Brunch"
"6249","Ted","I know.","02","03","Brunch"
"6250","Robin","They love me!","02","03","Brunch"
"6251","Back inside, later.Ted's mother","So we are definitely going to try and communicate more.","02","03","Brunch"
"6252","Ted's father","From now on, full disclosure.","02","03","Brunch"
"6253","Ted","Good. Good, I think it'll be really good for the family. By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't returned my last couple calls.","02","03","Brunch"
"6254","Ted's mother","I'm gonna get some juice.","02","03","Brunch"
"6255","Ted","No. No.","02","03","Brunch"
"6256","Ted's father","You missed a great game last night. Real squeaker.","02","03","Brunch"
"6257","Ted from 2030","Kids, sometimes your relationship goes so smoothly for so long that you think it will be that way forever. It never is.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6258","Ted","Well, we just had our first fight.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6259","Robin","We had our first fight.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6260","Barney","Oh, no, what'd you fight about? (He puts his headphones on).","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6261","Ted","A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building...","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6262","Robin","It's this big skyscraper in Spokane. It'd be a huge project for his firm.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6263","Ted","And if we don't get it, we could go under.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6264","Robin","So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6265","Both Marshall and Barney","No.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6266","Ted","Yes.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6267","Marshall","Well, all skyscrapers kind of look like a...","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6268","Ted","Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6269","Marshall","Wow, so it's the whole package.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6270","Barney","Yeah, you did.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6271","Marshall","Had to.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6272","Barney","Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6273","Marshall","Yeah, you did.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6274","Barney","Had to.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6275","Ted","It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6276","Marshall","Yeah, you did.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6277","Ted","That wasn't one.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6278","Lily","So you and Ted had your first fight. It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6279","Robin","Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6280","Lily","Ooh, two tragedies in one day.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6281","Robin","The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6282","Ted","Hey.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6283","Robin","Hey.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6284","Ted","How was your day?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6285","Robin","Good.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6286","Ted","Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6287","Robin","No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6288","Ted","You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6289","Robin","Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6290","Lily","Robin!","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6291","Robin","What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6292","Lily","You should work at a suicide hotline.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6293","Robin","And then it got ugly.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6294","Robin","What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like Die Hard. But Field of Dreams? Once is more than enough.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6295","Ted","So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is Field of Dreams?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6296","Robin","It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6297","Robin","So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6298","Lily","Robin, he's upset because you wouldn't listen to him, not because you didn't like some movie.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6299","Ted","How do you not like Field of Dreams?!","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6300","Lily","Listening is the foundation of a relationship. And if he's really droning on, you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards. You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6301","Robin","I guess I don't know how to do that.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6302","Lily","Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober. That's what I tried to explain to the cop.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6303","Robin","No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6304","Lily","What the hell comes before ""Q""?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6305","Ted","Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6306","Barney (brokenly)","Can we talk about something else?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6307","Marshall","You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6308","Barney","Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6309","Marshall","That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6310","Barney","Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6311","Ted","I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6312","Marshall","Your job's not boring.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6313","Ted","Robin thinks so.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6314","Barney","Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6315","Ted","I love it when you quote Scripture.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6316","Barney","I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6317","Ted","Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6318","Barney","That's 'cause you're always like... (Dully) ""Ted Mosby, architect"". If it were me, I'd be like... (Confidently) ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6319","Marshall (suavely)","Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off..","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6320","Barney","Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Trust me.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6321","Ted","Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6322","Girl","Are you kidding? Architects are hot. How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6323","Ted","Solid point. She did have hair of gold.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6324","Girl","Yes, she did.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6325","Ted","Mm-hmm.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6326","Robin","Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6327","Carl","No. Hey, Lily. You still single?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6328","Lily","Yes.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6329","Carl","You know... I've poured a lot of free drinks for you over the years. A lot.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6330","Lily","Carl, do you really want to be with a woman who would trade s*x for beer?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6331","Carl","Only if you're into it. It's on me.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6332","Lily","Thanks.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6333","Robin","I wonder where Ted went.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6334","A girl","Ted Mosby, the architect?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6335","Robin","Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6336","Girl 1","And what made you decide you wanted to become an architect?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6337","Ted","Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6338","Girl 1","I bet you can draw, can't you? You should draw me.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6339","Ted","Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to. Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6340","Girls","Yeah.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6341","Lily","He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6342","Robin","Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6343","Lily","What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6344","Robin","I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6345","Girl","She's a kickboxing instructor. Her ass looks better than my face.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6346","Robin","All right, we'll swing by the party.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6347","Ted from 2030","Now the party was for some of Marshall's classmates from Columbia Law School, who by day were some of the sharpest and most serious young legal minds in the country. By night, however...","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6348","Robin","Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6349","Guy 1","Okay! Seriously... Who wants to shave my ass?!","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6350","Ted from 2030","That guy went on to become a Supreme Court justice.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6351","Lily","Okay, where are the guys and the hooker?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6352","Guy 2","Yo, what's up, ladies? Welcome to the party. Yeah! Just need you to sign this release protecting the host from any and all responsibility should you harm yourself or a third party. Then freakin' rage! Yeah!","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6353","Robin","Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6354","Guy 2","You mean Ted Mosby, the architect? Man, what a visionary. Yeah, they were here.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6355","Ted","Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6356","Girl","Wow. I would love to watch the sun rise with you.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6357","Ted","I know you would. It's the job.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6358","Guy 2 (to guy 1)","Dude. You should let us shave your ass tonight.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6359","Guy 1","No way.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6360","Girl 2","Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6361","Marshall","I didn't want to ruin the party for everybody this early, but, uh... everyone take a seat. Um... Lily actually called off the wedding this summer to go to San Francisco. So... We're broken up.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6362","Guy 2","Her name wasn't on your lease, was it? 'Cause if not, New York state law, you're not obligated to give her half the deposit when you move.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6363","Marshall","Yeah, that's not really the part I was worried about, guys.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6364","Girl 2","And don't forget the precedent set by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74. Any personal effects she left in your house or dwelling become yours after 30 days.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6365","Marshall","Guys, can we cease and desist with the lawyer speak for a minute? Love died. The love that made you all believe in love, that's dead now.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6366","Girl 2","You should sue her.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6367","Marshall","Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6368","Kara","On the grounds of... shut up.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6369","Ted from 2030","That's our Attorney General.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6370","Lily","See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup. Why? Because I listened to him. It was a strong and nurturing relationship that I threw away like old gum.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6371","Robin","Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6372","Guy 2","The girl with the smackable ass.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6373","Robin","Yes, that's the young lady.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6374","Girl","So, I know the bouncer at this techno club, Posers. Do you feel like dancing?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6375","Robin","Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing. Ted hates clubs.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6376","Ted","Hell, yeah. I love clubs. I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight, kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum. But sure, let's go dancing.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6377","Girl","Yay!","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6378","Ted","Wait, let me just check with my friend.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6379","Girl","Okay.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6380","Ted","Hey, Marshall. You up for some super loud, repetitive music that hasn't changed since the mid-90s?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6381","Marshall","Um... only always.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6382","Ted","Let's go.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6383","Robin","Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to s*x.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6384","Lily","Did you grow up in that Footloose town?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6385","Robin","I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6386","Lily","Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6387","Robin","He's not answering. Calling Marshall.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6388","Marshall","Hello.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6389","Robin","Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6390","Marshall","Oh, Robin, hi. Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. He's, uh... he's working.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6391","Robin","Uh, okay. Bye. (She hangs up) Marshall just lied. Ted's cheating on me.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6392","Robin","Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier. One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair. And the other's a cheating b*st*rd.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6393","Bouncer","You're going to need to refresh my memory.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6394","Lily","Okay, fella. Baby knows how this game's played. How's a $20 help your memory?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6395","Bouncer","Thanks, but seriously, it was crazy tonight. You really do need to refresh my memory.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6396","Lily","Then can I have the...? That's cool. You keep that.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6397","Robin","So these guys... One of them's an architect.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6398","Bouncer","Ted Mosby, the architect?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6399","Robin","That's the one.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6400","Bouncer","Oh, yeah, he was here.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6401","Ted","And then I was all, ""No, Frank Gehry, you're on your own this time."" And that, my dear, was the end of that hack's career.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6402","Girl","I live across the street.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6403","Ted","That is one hell of a non sequitur.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6404","Girl","You want to come over?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6405","Ted","Well, I don't know. But I suppose I should at least give you a ride home. Hop on. (The girl jumps on Ted's back)","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6406","Girl (to the bouncer)","I'll see you at book club, Vinny.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6407","Bouncer","Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudités.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6408","Girl","Nice. Giddy up!","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6409","Marshall","Dude, dude, what are you doing?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6410","Ted","Galloping.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6411","Marshall","You proved it, all right? The whole ""Ted Mosby, architect"" things works.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6412","Girl","Architects rule! Whoo-hee!","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6413","Marshall","Aren't you a little worried that a certain somebody might find out that you're doing this? This isn't you, Ted.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6414","Ted","It is tonight. Whoo!","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6415","Robin","You know this girl. Where does she live?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6416","Bouncer","I'm not telling you that for less than 20 bucks.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6417","Lily","Well, I'm out of money.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6418","Robin","I'm cashed, too.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6419","Bouncer","I'll take your purse.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6420","Robin","My purse?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6421","Bouncer","Yeah, my girl likes clutches.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6422","Robin","Okay, fine.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6423","Lily","You should tell her that looks really good with a chocolate boot.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6424","Robin","Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse. No room for my gun. Here. Now where does the rodeo slut live?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6425","Bouncer","The building with the green light, apartment 3-C.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6426","Lily","Oh, my God, Robin, are you going to kick this girl's ass?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6427","Robin","Yeah... And steal her purse.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6428","Robin","I can't believe he's cheating on me. You know how many times I could have cheated? Six... no seven. And you know two of them, and they would surprise you.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6429","Lily","3-C, let's do this. You ready?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6430","Robin","Should I just kick the door in?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6431","Lily","Those are really nice heels and you already lost the purse. Let's see if it's unlocked. It's unlocked. Okay, get in there and kick some spankable ass. Robin?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6432","Robin","I'm the problem.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6433","Lily","What?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6434","Robin","You were right. I don't know how to be a girlfriend. I took the nicest guy in the world and I made him a cheater.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6435","Lily","Well, don't stand out here and beat yourself up. Get in there and beat Ted up. I'll handle the slutty kickboxer. Actually, I'll take Ted.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6436","Robin","Let's do this.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6437","Lily","Bring it. (They come in)","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6438","Robin","What do you think you're...? Barney?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6439","Barney (tied up to the bed)","Thank God you're here. Can you help with this? I need nails.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6440","Robin","Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6441","Barney","Ted? He's at work.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6442","Robin","How did you get here?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6443","Barney","Awesome story. As per usual.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6444","Girl","How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6445","Ted","Solid point. And she did have hair of gold.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6446","Girl","Yes, she did.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6447","Barney (coming back in the bar)","Sorry, I forgot my binocs for Foxy Boxing. Whoo, looks like things just got a little foxier right here.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6448","Ted","Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6449","Girl","Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6450","Barney","Yeah, stay (mouthing ""go"")","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6451","Ted","Excuse us for one second. (To Barney) Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6452","Barney","Yeah, you did.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6453","Ted","Yeah, had to. See ya. (He leaves)","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6454","Barney (to the girl)","Sorry, my, uh... intern had to leave.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6455","Girl","Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6456","Barney","Ted Mosby... Architect.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6457","Barney","But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6458","Anna","Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up!","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6459","Marshall","Dude, dude, what are you doing?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6460","Barney","Galloping.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6461","Marshall","All right, you proved it. The whole ""Ted Mosby, architect"" thing works.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6462","Anna","Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6463","Marshall","Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6464","Barney","It is tonight.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6465","Barney","And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6466","Robin","But why would you use Ted's name?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6467","Barney","I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole ""using my real name"" thing.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6468","Lily","Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6469","Robin","Everything isn't okay. Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6470","Lily","This is how people act in relationships.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6471","Robin","And that's why I avoid relationships.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6472","Lily","Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6473","Barney","And thus ended this chapter of, ""Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand."" Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6474","Robin","You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6475","Barney","I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a ""A."" A... A... I'll just put ""resident."" Go, go, go, go.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6476","Ted from 2030","Robin took a long walk that night. She thought about how opening yourself up to another person usually means opening yourself up to going a little crazy. She thought about how much easier it was just to be alone. And then she came to see me.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6477","Robin","Hey.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6478","Ted","Hey. What are you doing here?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6479","Robin","I brought donuts. And I don't want to brag, but they're filled with jelly.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6480","Ted","Thanks. So, uh... how was your night?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6481","Robin","It was... fine. Nothing exciting. How was yours?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6482","Ted","You really want to hear about boring architect stuff?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6483","Robin","Yes, I do. I'm sorry about earlier. To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of Field of Dreams. I fell asleep half way through.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6484","Ted","What? The best part's the last 20 minutes.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6485","Robin","Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause... You know what, um... What I'm trying to say is... I love being the person you bitch to. So how was your day, Mr. Architect?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6486","Ted","Oh, I like the way you say that. Hey, you want to see the building that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6487","Robin","Obviously. Wow.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6488","Ted","Yes.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6489","Robin","You know, you didn't mention all the foliage around the base. If you trim that back, the rest would look bigger.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6490","Ted","You don't have to tell me. And, um... just for fun, I've... I've sort of been working on my own idea of what I think the building should be. What do you think?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6491","Ted from 2030","You know that time we went to Spokane and I pointed out that skyscraper? That was the first building I ever designed. And that night was the first time I showed anyone my first drawing of it.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6492","Robin","Wow. Ted, this is amazing.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6493","Ted","Thanks. It's not like it will ever come to anything.","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6494","Robin","I don't know. It might come to something. You know, girls find architects very hot. (They kiss)","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6495","Ted","Okay, but I don't want you expecting 78 storeys or anything. (They kiss again)","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6496","Anna's apartment. Anna's reading the letter Barney left.Barney's voice","""Dear Resident... The time we spent together, however long it was, meant the world to me. I would love to see you again, but unfortunately, I cannot. You see, I am a ghost. I can't only materialize once every decade on the anniversary of my death. I chose to spend my one day among the living with you, sweet... Resident. Perhaps we will meet again in another decade, provided you keep your figure. Until then, all my love from the beyond. Barney.""","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6497","Anna","Barney? Who the hell is Barney?","02","04","Ted Mosby: Architect"
"6498","Ted (from 2030)","Your Uncle Barney was always a bit of an enigma. In all the years we lived in new york, none of us had ever set foot in his apartment. Until one day, one of us did.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6499","Barney","Aaaaaaah!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6500","Lily","Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6501","Ted (from 2030)","It's a pretty good story. And believe it or not, alcohol did not play a role. It all started two weeks earlier at Lily's housewarming.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6502","Lily","Welcome to my new home.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6503","Ted","Oh, wow, Lily, this is... Oh, this is all of it.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6504","Lily","Yeah,I know it's small, but it's got character. Thank you. And I am learning Lithuanian from my neighbors. They're great. They're always out there in the hall, you know, cooking and gambling and giving each other haircuts. It's nice.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6505","Ted","Hey,is that a toilet in your kitchen?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6506","Robin","Or a stove in your bathroom?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6507","Lily","Oh, that's not just a stove. That's a stovenkerator  a combination of a stove, oven and sink and refrigerator. Stovenkerator. Isn't that futuristic?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6508","Ted","God,I hope not. Hey, cool murphy bed.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6509","Lily","It's kind of a mess. I didn't make my bed this morning, so...","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6510","Robin","Oh! You know what? I bet sleeping at this angle is good for you. For some reason.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6511","Ted","Hold on, I got it.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6512","Lily","That was ""something, something, I am going to something you like a something donkey.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6513","Robin","Uh. Other cultures!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6514","Lily","Hey, let's break out the fruit basket. Hey, who ate all the...? (Mouse squeaking) Aaaaaah!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6515","Ted","Okay, we have to get Lily out of that apartment. Her roommate is a raccoon.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6516","Robin","I'd offer her my place, but I've got dogs and she's allergic.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6517","Ted","Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think she's a little more allergic to that.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6518","Robin","What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery, but it's gotta have a couch.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6519","Barney","The fortress of barnitude? No way.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6520","Robin","Come on. She's desperate.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6521","Barney","Hmm, normally a prerequisite for the women I bring home, but... pass.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6522","Marshall (arriving)","One of you guys is very, very lucky because I have... A boom! An extra ticket to the Alanis Morissette concert. Who's in?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6523","Robin","Absolutely not.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6524","Ted","No.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6525","Marshall","Damn! I got these tickets like months ago for me and Lily and now I can't find anyone to go with me. This is what I miss about being in a couple. I always had someone to go to concerts with, or farmer's market, or brunch. God, I miss brunch!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6526","Ted","Well, I guess you could - well, you could try going to brunch alone.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6527","Marshall","Oh, you don't think I've tried?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6528","Marshall","Table for one.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6529","Head waiter","One... Couple?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6530","Marshall","Um, no, just me.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6531","Head waiter","Really? For brunch?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6532","Marshall","You're right. Who am I kidding?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6533","Robin","Oh, the Popover Pantry! That place is great. Can we go get brunch tomorrow?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6534","Ted","Of course, sweetie.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6535","Marshall","Can I go with you guys?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6536","Ted","Really? For brunch?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6537","Marshall","God, I hate being single!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6538","At Barney's apartment.Barney (on the phone)","Okay,I'll take the over on the Pittsburgh game. Oh and P. to the S., I never got my payout from Seattle from two weeks ago. Yeah. Don't make me call the gaming commission on you. I'm sure they'd be very interested to know what's going on over there. All right? All right? Okay, I love you too Mom. Take care. (He hangs up) Hello Lily. You've somehow managed to circumvent my security. How did you do it?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6539","Lily","Ted gave me your spare key.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6540","Ted","Spare key! Brilliant!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6541","Lily","I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here if I had no other choice. But earlier today, I was getting ready to go to sleep and...","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6542","Barney","That's terrible. Well, see ya.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6543","Lily","Wait, can I stay here maybe?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6544","Barney","I'd let you, but I don't have any room.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6545","Lily","You live in a two-bedroom apartment. You have one room just for your suits.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6546","Barney","Hey I'm at a point in my life where my suits are my family. Look around you Lily. You are in the heart of bachelor country, and as a woman, you are an illegal immigrant here. Now,you can try to apply for a s*x visa, but that only lasts 12 hours. 14 if you qualify for multiple entry.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6547","Lily","Ewww!...Is something some lame, judgmental chick would say, but I say give me multiple high fives.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6548","Barney","Wow, you really are desperate.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6549","Lily","I really am.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6550","Barney","Oh okay, you can stay here for two days. But I only have one rule. You can't change anything.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6551","Lily","Why would I change anything? This place is... Perfect. Except for the fact that you don't have a TV.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6552","Barney","See that wall? 300-inch flat-screen. They only sell them in Japan, but I know a guy. Had to ship it over in a tugboat like freakin' King Kong.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6553","Lily","It hurts my eyes.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6554","Barney","Yeah. That doesn't go away.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6555","Ted","Hey, where have you been?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6556","Marshall","The Alanis Morissette concert.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6557","Ted","By yourself?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6558","Marshall","No,actually I went with a friend from law school.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6559","Robin","Oh,really? Who's this friend?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6560","Marshall","Brad.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6561","Brad","Bro, Alanis Morissette rocks!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6562","Marshall","Totally! I can't believe I almost didn't come tonight.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6563","Brad","Let me guess  you bought the tickets for you and Lily right before she dumped you.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6564","Marshall","Yeah, how'd you know?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6565","Brad","I just got dumped myself.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6566","Marshall","What? Kara broke up with you? I'm sorry,man. That sucks. Brad,do you like brunch?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6567","Ted","You invited him to brunch?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6568","Marshall","Yeah, I invited him to brunch. Why? Is that weird?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6569","Ted","Yes. That's why I was all ""you invited him to brunch?""","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6570","Marshall","Why can't two guys who are friends go to brunch?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6571","Ted","Because brunch is kind of...","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6572","Robin","Girly.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6573","Marshall","Girly? Breakfast isn't girly. Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6574","Ted","I don't know. There's nothing girly about a horse, nothing girly about a horn, but put them together and you get a unicorn.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6575","Marshall","I don't care what either of you say, I am going to the Popover Pantry with Brad. We're here. We're hungry. Get used to it, brunch.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6576","Barney","Uhm, smells delicious.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6577","Lily","Thank you. There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up... (Barney puts the breakfast in the trash) What are you doing?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6578","Barney","Lily, what was the first rule again?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6579","Lily","""Don't change anything""?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6580","Barney","And what was the second rule?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6581","Lily","There was no second rule.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6582","Barney","Exactly! There was only one rule and you broke it.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6583","Lily","I bought groceries. That counts as changing something?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6584","Barney","Lily, if I wanted a fridge full of groceries or fresh coffee in the morning, I'd be in a relationship. But I don't want to be in a relationship. That's why I make it crystal-clear to every girl that walks through that door that this is not a place to leave a toothbrush. This is not a place to leave a contact lens case. This is a place to leave. Come on, 'll give you a tour. Uh, no flash photography please. Bienvenido to the bedroom. Dig this  King-sized bed, full-sized blanket, one pillow. Everything about this bed says ""our work here is done."" Next we say bienvenue to the bathroom. What, only one towel? What, no hairdryer? You know where I keep that stuff? Your place. Beat it. And the coup de gr&acirc;ce... Yeah, that's right. Patent-pending. And wilkommen to the hallway. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p0rn...","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6585","Lily","Marshall doesn't have p0rn.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6586","Barney","Aww, that's sweet. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p0rn, I had mine professionally lit. Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6587","Lily","And if that doesn't drive them away, there's always your life-sized storm-trooper.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6588","Barney","No,that's just awesome. So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here, I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else. My apartment does it for me.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6589","Marshall","God, I love brunch.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6590","Brad","Oh, damn... The zucchini bread is ridonculous.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6591","Marshall","This isn't weird, right?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6592","Brad","I sort of thought it might be, but it totally isn't. Oh and btw, you totally did not oversell the eggs benny.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6593","Marshall","Right? Right?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6594","Brad","I mean, why can't two single bros go out and rock brunch Sunday morning-style?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6595","Marshall","Exactly. Thank you, that's exactly what I've been saying.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6596","Brad","This must be destiny.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6597","Marshall","What are you talking about?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6598","Brad","I have two tickets for Mamma Mia! friday night. You like Abba, right? What am I saying?Who doesn't? Anyway, I was gonna take Kara, but now it's all you and me. We're gonna do Broadway, bro style. What do you say?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6599","Marshall","Yeah!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6600","Barney","Hey. Did the cold wake you?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6601","Girl","No,I've just been watching you sleep.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6602","Barney","Oh,did you try and take a shower? I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6603","Girl","I don't buy into the myth that we need to shower every day.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6604","Barney","Okay. I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to...","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6605","Girl","I'm boycotting coffee. You may as well drink the tears of a colombian peasant farmer. God, I love this place. Good thing I don't have a job because I could stay here all day.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6606","Barney","I think I left something on the bookshelf. Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look (he shows her his p0rn) Oh, I'm disgusting.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6607","Girl","Wow, you're open about your sexuality and that's one of the reasons I love you. Did I just say that? Oh well. Cat's out of the bag. I love you.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6608","Barney","Whoa, uh, okay. Beep beep. Backing up, um...","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6609","Lily (walking in)","Barney... Oh!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6610","Girl","Oh my god! Are you married? Is this your wife?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6611","Barney","What? No. Yes!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6612","Girl","Yes?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6613","Barney","Yes.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6614","Girl","You son of a bitch! I can't believe I let you enter my sacred temple.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6615","Barney","Come on, baby. please, no. You don't understand. What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...? (The girl is gone. To Lily) You're not going anywhere. Live claritin clear. Wow, that was close. That hippie chick wouldn't leave. She was ready to squat here.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6616","Lily","Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6617","Barney","She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment... Except you. You're better than p0rn.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6618","Lily","Thank you.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6619","Barney","How would you like to extend your stay here? All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife, and scare off the occasional one-night stand. I know,I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles...","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6620","Lily","I'll do it.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6621","Barney","Really?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6622","Lily","Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6623","Barney","I'll take it.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6624","At MacLaren's","NA At MacLaren's","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6625","Ted","Mamma mia!?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6626","Marshall","Mamma mia!. You know what? It's supposed to be a great musical, okay? It won all sorts of Tonies and stuff.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6627","Ted","No, totally. It sounds like a really, really fun, exciting, third date.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6628","Robin","Ooh, third date. You know what that means.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6629","Marshall","It is not a date,okay. It's just two bros taking in a Broadway show.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6630","Ted","You bros going to get dinner beforehand?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6631","Marshall","We might grab a steak, yeah.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6632","Ted","Where at?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6633","Marshall","Café l'amour. (Ted and Robin laugh) Brad says the food is really good there, okay?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6634","Robin","Sounds like Brad's got quite the night planned out. You better bring your ""A"" game. That means no granny panties.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6635","Marshall","All right, you know what? You two are just threatened because I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' stuff. Well, guess what? It's my territory now. I'm peeing all over brunches, fancy dinners and musicals. That's right. Brad and I are taking back Broadway.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6636","Ted","What are you going to wear?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6637","Marshall","I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin... (Ted and Robin laugh) Oh, you know what? Shut up.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6638","Barney","Can you pass the arts and leisure? (The girl does it. More loudly) Can you pass the arts and leisure?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6639","Girl","I just did.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6640","Lily (walking in)","Honey, I'm... Barney, what the hell is going on here?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6641","Barney","Lily, I can explain...","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6642","Lily","How could you? In our own home? (She slaps him) You b*st*rd!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6643","Girl","I'm so sorry. I-i didn't know he had...","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6644","Lily","Just get out. This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years to put you through medical school? I got breast implants for you. I... (The girl is gone) I was just about to turn on the tears.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6645","Barney","Brava. That was incredible. And that slap was genius. You did not hold back.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6646","Lily","Yeah, that I just always wanted to do.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6647","Barney","Fair enough. I have to say, it's kind of nice having food around here for a change.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6648","Lily","You know... Oh nah, never mind.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6649","Barney","What? You're my wife. You can tell me anything.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6650","Lily","Well,if you really wanted to sell this ruse, we should try to make this place a little more... You know, homey. Like... Like a woman would actually live here.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6651","Barney","What did you have in mind?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6652","Ted","Hey,you're home. I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6653","Marshall","Ha,ha,ha,ha. It wasn't a date. Okay, it was a date and it got way weird.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6654","Marshall","Oh, you really don't have to do that.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6655","Brad","No, I insist. You're my guest.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6656","Marshall","Thanks, Brad.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6657","Brad","Bro. You got some chocolate on your chin. Still there. I'll get that bad boy. (He licks his serviette and cleans Marshall's chin)","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6658","Ted","Woah!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6659","Robin","Well, it could have been worse. It could have fallen in your lap.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6660","Marshall","It gets worse.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6661","Marshall","No, I can do it, Brad. Okay,thank you.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6662","Brad","So anyway,ah,it's this Saturday. Do you want to come?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6663","Marshall","You want me to go to a wedding with you?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6664","Ted","Okay, that's not too bad. Two single guys on the prowl. It'll be like ""Wedding crashers"".","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6665","Robin","Just keep Brad away from the bouquet.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6666","Marshall","It gets worse.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6667","Brad","It gets better.The foliage in Vermont this time of year is ridonc.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6668","Marshall","Vermont?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6669","Brad","Yeah,the wedding's at this awesome B&B. Kara and I used to go there. Anyway, there is one room left,and we got it. Walt Whitman Suite, bro.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6670","Ted","You said no, right?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6671","Marshall","Of course.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6672","Brad","I understand. It's cool. It's the first time I was going to see my college friends since Kara left me. I just... I just miss her so much. (Brad starts sobbing)","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6673","Marshall","I'll go to Vermont with you.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6674","Brad","That's great! You know, uh, they're registered at Pottery Barn. I figure we could go halfsies on a gravy boat.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6675","Ted","I'm sorry. It's not funny anymore.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6676","Marshall","Damn you,brunch! This guy's crazy, right?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6677","Ted","Look,I don't think he's crazy. I just think he's suffering from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal. And unfortunately, you're his nicotine patch.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6678","Robin","And now you have to do what every dysfunctional couple has to do  Break up.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6679","Marshall","You're right. You're right. I promised brad I would go to the wedding with him,and then that is it.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6680","Ted","Good man.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6681","Lily","Oh,I think we made the right decision going for the custom-made italian sheets.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6682","Barney","Hey, if my bed's going suit up, it's going to do it right. Want to give it a whirl?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6683","Lily (jumping on the bed)","Oh. Ooooh!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6684","Barney","All right, I'm going to head out, hit the bars. What are you going to do tonight?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6685","Lily","Oh, I was just going to watch ""Letterman"" but, God this bed is so comfy. I wish you had a TV in here. (Barney turns on a another wall-size TV) Okay, seriously, what do you do for a living?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6686","Barney","Please. (He settles himself on the bed)","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6687","Lily","I thought you were going out.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6688","Barney","Eh. After the monologue.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6689","Ted (from 2030)","The next morning, as the sun rose over Manhattan, your Uncle Marshall headed over to Brad's apartment to leave for the wedding in Vermont. But when he got there...","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"

"6691","Ted","Hold on. (To Robin) Brad got him flowers. (They laugh) I'm sorry. It just got funny again. (Marshall hangs up)","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6692","Brad","Oh, hey...","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6693","Marshall","No, Brad, uh, I don't want to hear it. I do like you. And calla lilies are my favorite flower. I don't know how you knew that. I guess you just get me, but this is not cool, man. I can't believe that you would...","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6694","Girl","Hey,sweetie.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6695","Brad","Hey. (They kiss and Brad give her the flowers)","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6696","Girl","Aww. Hey, Marshall.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6697","Marshall","Hi, Kara. So you guys,are like back together now?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"

"6706","Barney","I can't believe we just... You and I... What have we done?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6707","Lily","Nothing. Nothing happened. We... We just went to sleep.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6708","Barney","""Just went to sleep""? I don't sleep in the same bed as a woman and not make a move. How could... You! You spooned me against my will.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6709","Lily","Hey,it takes two to cuddle.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6710","Barney","We... We redecorated my place. We stayed in on a friday night to watch ""Letterman"", and then slept together and didn't have s*x? Oh my God! We're in a relationship!","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6711","Lily","That's what you think a relationship is?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6712","Barney","You were supposed to be the vaccine, but you gave me the disease. You gotta go.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6713","Lily","Barney. I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself. You let down your guard, and let someone into your life, and... And it actually felt okay. And that terrifies you.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6714","Barney","Uh-uh. You gotta go.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6715","Lily","Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place, and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6716","Barney","""A certain standard of living""? You didn't pay a single...","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6717","Ted (from 2030)","And so Mr. and Mrs. Stinson, after two weeks of marriage, decided to call it quits. Fortunately, they reached a settlement. And that's the story of how Aunt Lily furnished her apartment.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6718","Ted (from 2030)","Marshall ran into Brad again some time later.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6719","Marshall","Oh my God, it's Brad. Laugh like I said something really funny. (Ted laughs)","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6720","Ted","That was great.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6721","Marshall","Right? Right?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6722","Brad","Hey, Marshall.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6723","Marshall","Oh, hey, hey, how's it going?","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6724","Brad","It's good. (To ted) Hey, I'm uh...","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6725","Ted","Yeah, I know who you are.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6726","Brad","Well,I got to go. I got this thing.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6727","Marshall","Yeah, me too, but more important.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6728","Brad","So, I guess I'll see you around.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6729","Marshall","Sure. Sure. (Brad leaves) Even if you don't believe it, tell me he looks fat.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6730","Ted","Totally looks fat.","02","05","World's Greatest Couple"
"6731","Ted from 2030","Kids, when you reach your late twenty, you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out. Like with aunt Lily. Even though she was back from San Francisco, she was still on a quest to find herself.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6732","Lily","It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6733","Ted from 2030","And she did find it.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6734","Lily (coming in Robin's)","I'm going to be a life coach.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6735","Ted from 2030","In fact, she found it again and again.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6736","Lily","I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"

"6741","Robin","No.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6742","Marshall","Here she comes. Here she comes.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6743","Lily","Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6744","Robin","I'm sorry.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6745","Barney","Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. (Marshall takes a photo of her).","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6746","Lily","What do you want?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6747","Ted","I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6748","Lily","Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6749","Barney","I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6750","Ted","No.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6751","Lily","My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6752","Ted","Robin, nothing to add?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6753","Robin","No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6754","Lily","Thank you.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6755","Robin","Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6756","Marshall","I've never need the beer more than I do right now.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6757","Ted","I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this.""","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6758","Marshall","Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6759","Barney","Really? Laid, you say?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6760","Marshall","You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6761","Barney","She hot?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6762","Marshall","Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6763","Barney","And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6764","Robin","A what?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6765","Barney","A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6766","Ted","What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6767","Barney","Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6768","Marshall","I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6769","Barney","Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6770","Lily (arriving)","So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei...","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6771","Marshall","Classic.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6772","Robin","Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6773","Ted","Yeah. Somebody did just quit.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6774","Ted","So, where should we eat today? (looking at the assistant with a whole chicken in a container) Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? (the girl leaves, crying)","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6775","Marshall","Dude, that is cold-blooded.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6776","Ted","It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6777","Robin","Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6778","Ted","It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6779","Barney","Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6780","Ted","So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6781","Lily","What would I be doing?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6782","Ted","Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6783","Ted","You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6784","Lily","Oh, right, is that the...?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6785","Ted","Yeah. Here's the model.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6786","Lily","You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6787","Ted","I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6788","Lily","How can he not see it? I mean there's the...","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6789","Ted","I know.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6790","Lily","And the way it...","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6791","Ted","I know.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6792","Lily","And the two little...","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6793","Ted","I know.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6794","Lily","It is just...","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6795","Mr Druthers (arriving)","Spectacular? Why, thank you.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6796","Ted","Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6797","Mr Druthers","Ah.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6798","Lily","Nice to meet you.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6799","Mr Druthers","Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6800","Ted","I, uh... I am an architect.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6801","Mr Druthers","Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6802","Ted","Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6803","Mr Druthers","Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6804","Ted","Absolutely.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6805","Mr Druthers","So you're going to design the...","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6806","Ted","Styrofoam trees.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6807","Mr Druthers","Once again, with feeling.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6808","Ted","Styrofoam trees.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6809","Mr Druthers","Styrofoam trees!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6810","Ted","Styrofoam trees!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6811","Mr Druthers","That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? (He leaves)","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6812","Lily","Man, that guy is a total, well... (gestures to the building model)","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6813","Marshall","Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6814","Barney","Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6815","Marshall","Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6816","Barney","Who do you rather have grading your papers  a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6817","Marshall","Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6818","Barney (stepping into the office, speaking with an Italian accent)","Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa...","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6819","Pr Lewis","Tell me what you want or get out.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6820","Barney","Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6821","Pr Lewis","Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6822","Lily","I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6823","Ted","He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean  crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6824","Robin","Did you show lily your design?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6825","Ted","No.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6826","Lily","What design?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6827","Ted","It's nothing.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6828","Robin","It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6829","Lily","Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6830","Ted","Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6831","Barney","Oh, my god. Incredible.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6832","Pr Lewis","Hmm... C minus.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6833","Barney","C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6834","Pr Lewis","You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6835","Lily","Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6836","Ted","Okay, I'm done.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6837","Lily","Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6838","Ted","Great. Thanks.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6839","Mr Druthers","Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6840","Ted","Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6841","Mr Druthers","Too green.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6842","Ted","Too green?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6843","Mr Druthers","Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6844","Ted","I can't un-picture it.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6845","Mr Druthers","Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6846","Ted","What? What's gone?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6847","Mr Druthers","My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6848","Ted","Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6849","Mr Druthers","What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6850","Ted","Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6851","Mr Druthers","Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6852","Ted","Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6853","Lily","Hey.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6854","Ted","Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6855","Lily","That's easy. I took it.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6856","Ted","Why?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6857","Lily","It's simple.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6858","Mr Druthers","Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6859","Mr Druthers (to a kid)","What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6860","Lily","Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6861","Ted","What does his ball have to do with anything?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6862","Lily","Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6863","Robin","Hey, guys. What's going on?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6864","Ted","Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6865","Robin","Why? Was he being mean?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6866","Ted","You know about this?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6867","Robin","Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6868","Lily","Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6869","Robin","I gave them to you for your birthday.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6870","Ted","So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6871","Lily","I prefer to call them ""justice khakis.""","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6872","Ted","That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6873","Lily","So is being mean.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6874","Ted","Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6875","Lily","Well, that's why I left a note.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6876","Ted","A note?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6877","Lily","Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6878","Ted","Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6879","Lily","I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6880","Marshall","I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6881","Barney","I know, I know.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6882","Marshall","You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6883","Barney","Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6884","Marshall","Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6885","Barney","I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6886","Barney","I think I'm falling in love with you.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6887","Pr Lewis","Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6888","Barney","What? No.We had s*x yesterday.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6889","Pr Lewis","Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6890","Ted","When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6891","Lily","No.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6892","Ted","What do you mean, no?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6893","Lily","I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6894","Ted","Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6895","Mr Druthers","Everybody get in here now!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6896","Lily","""Who wants espresso?""","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6897","Mr Druthers","Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6898","Lily","Interesting.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6899","Mr Druthers","Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever ""allegedly"" did!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6900","Lily","Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6901","Ted","Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6902","Lily","No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6903","Ted","This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6904","Lily","All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6905","Ted","No. You'll give it back or you're fired.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6906","Lily","I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6907","Ted","Then you're fired.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6908","Lily","Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6909","Marshall","Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6910","Barney","Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6911","Marshall","So you're going back over there?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6912","Barney","Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6913","Barney","I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6914","Pr Lewis","Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6915","Barney","But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6916","Pr Lewis","Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6917","Mr Druthers","Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6918","Ted","Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6919","Mr Druthers","Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6920","Ted","Lily was mentally deranged.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6921","Mr Druthers","You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6922","Ted","Lily was mentally deranged!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6923","Mr Druthers","Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6924","Man","The clients are here.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6925","Mr Druthers","Excellent. Bring them in.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6926","Ted from 2030","Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6927","Mr Druthers","Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6928","Client","That's a pen1s!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6929","Mr Druthers","That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6930","Client","We're not building a pen1s. You got any other ideas?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6931","Mr Druthers","Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6932","Client","Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6933","Ted from 2030","The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6934","Ted","Wait! We have one more idea for you.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6935","Mr Druthers","Ted, what are you doing?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6936","Ted","I have another design.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6937","Mr Druthers","Sit down, shut up right now.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6938","Ted","No.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6939","Robin","To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6940","All","Probably!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6941","Lily","Congrats, ted.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6942","Ted","Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6943","Lily","Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6944","Ted","Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6945","Lily","No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6946","Lily","Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6947","Robin","Barney! Oh, my god!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6948","Ted","What happened?","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6949","Pr Lewis","He broke his hip.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6950","Barney","That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6951","Pr Lewis","No, he's not fine.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6952","Marshall","Professor Lewis, hi.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6953","Pr Lewis","Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6954","Barney","Yeah, she was.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6955","Pr Lewis","B plus.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6956","Barney","B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6957","Marshall","Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6958","Barney","It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!","02","06","Aldrin Justice"
"6959","Ted from 2030","Kids, when you reach your late twenty, you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out. Like with aunt Lily. Even though she was back from San Francisco, she was still on a quest to find herself.","02","07","Swarley"
"6960","Lily","It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.","02","07","Swarley"
"6961","Ted from 2030","And she did find it.","02","07","Swarley"
"6962","Lily (coming in Robin's)","I'm going to be a life coach.","02","07","Swarley"
"6963","Ted from 2030","In fact, she found it again and again.","02","07","Swarley"
"6964","Lily","I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.","02","07","Swarley"
"6965","Robin (on the phone)","Her newest lifelong dream? Singing in a punk rock band.","02","07","Swarley"
"6966","Ted","What is she doing for money through all this?","02","07","Swarley"
"6967","Robin","Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.","02","07","Swarley"
"6968","Ted","Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?","02","07","Swarley"
"6969","Robin","No.","02","07","Swarley"
"6970","Marshall","Here she comes. Here she comes.","02","07","Swarley"
"6971","Lily","Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.","02","07","Swarley"
"6972","Robin","I'm sorry.","02","07","Swarley"
"6973","Barney","Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. (Marshall takes a photo of her).","02","07","Swarley"
"6974","Lily","What do you want?","02","07","Swarley"
"6975","Ted","I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.","02","07","Swarley"
"6976","Lily","Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.","02","07","Swarley"
"6977","Barney","I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?","02","07","Swarley"
"6978","Ted","No.","02","07","Swarley"
"6979","Lily","My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.","02","07","Swarley"
"6980","Ted","Robin, nothing to add?","02","07","Swarley"
"6981","Robin","No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.","02","07","Swarley"
"6982","Lily","Thank you.","02","07","Swarley"
"6983","Robin","Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.","02","07","Swarley"
"6984","Marshall","I've never need the beer more than I do right now.","02","07","Swarley"
"6985","Ted","I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this.""","02","07","Swarley"
"6986","Marshall","Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.","02","07","Swarley"
"6987","Barney","Really? Laid, you say?","02","07","Swarley"
"6988","Marshall","You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.","02","07","Swarley"
"6989","Barney","She hot?","02","07","Swarley"
"6990","Marshall","Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.","02","07","Swarley"
"6991","Barney","And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.","02","07","Swarley"
"6992","Robin","A what?","02","07","Swarley"
"6993","Barney","A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.","02","07","Swarley"
"6994","Ted","What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?","02","07","Swarley"
"6995","Barney","Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.","02","07","Swarley"
"6996","Marshall","I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...","02","07","Swarley"
"6997","Barney","Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.","02","07","Swarley"
"6998","Lily (arriving)","So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei...","02","07","Swarley"
"6999","Marshall","Classic.","02","07","Swarley"
"7000","Robin","Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?","02","07","Swarley"
"7001","Ted","Yeah. Somebody did just quit.","02","07","Swarley"
"7002","Ted","So, where should we eat today? (looking at the assistant with a whole chicken in a container) Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? (the girl leaves, crying)","02","07","Swarley"
"7003","Marshall","Dude, that is cold-blooded.","02","07","Swarley"
"7004","Ted","It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.","02","07","Swarley"
"7005","Robin","Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.","02","07","Swarley"
"7006","Ted","It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?","02","07","Swarley"
"7007","Barney","Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.","02","07","Swarley"
"7008","Ted","So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?","02","07","Swarley"
"7009","Lily","What would I be doing?","02","07","Swarley"
"7010","Ted","Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.","02","07","Swarley"
"7011","Ted","You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.","02","07","Swarley"
"7012","Lily","Oh, right, is that the...?","02","07","Swarley"
"7013","Ted","Yeah. Here's the model.","02","07","Swarley"
"7014","Lily","You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.","02","07","Swarley"
"7015","Ted","I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.","02","07","Swarley"
"7016","Lily","How can he not see it? I mean there's the...","02","07","Swarley"
"7017","Ted","I know.","02","07","Swarley"
"7018","Lily","And the way it...","02","07","Swarley"
"7019","Ted","I know.","02","07","Swarley"
"7020","Lily","And the two little...","02","07","Swarley"
"7021","Ted","I know.","02","07","Swarley"
"7022","Lily","It is just...","02","07","Swarley"
"7023","Mr Druthers (arriving)","Spectacular? Why, thank you.","02","07","Swarley"
"7024","Ted","Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.","02","07","Swarley"
"7025","Mr Druthers","Ah.","02","07","Swarley"
"7026","Lily","Nice to meet you.","02","07","Swarley"
"7027","Mr Druthers","Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?","02","07","Swarley"
"7028","Ted","I, uh... I am an architect.","02","07","Swarley"
"7029","Mr Druthers","Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?","02","07","Swarley"
"7030","Ted","Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.","02","07","Swarley"
"7031","Mr Druthers","Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?","02","07","Swarley"
"7032","Ted","Absolutely.","02","07","Swarley"
"7033","Mr Druthers","So you're going to design the...","02","07","Swarley"
"7034","Ted","Styrofoam trees.","02","07","Swarley"
"7035","Mr Druthers","Once again, with feeling.","02","07","Swarley"
"7036","Ted","Styrofoam trees.","02","07","Swarley"
"7037","Mr Druthers","Styrofoam trees!","02","07","Swarley"
"7038","Ted","Styrofoam trees!","02","07","Swarley"
"7039","Mr Druthers","That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? (He leaves)","02","07","Swarley"
"7040","Lily","Man, that guy is a total, well... (gestures to the building model)","02","07","Swarley"
"7041","Marshall","Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.","02","07","Swarley"
"7042","Barney","Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.","02","07","Swarley"
"7043","Marshall","Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.","02","07","Swarley"
"7044","Barney","Who do you rather have grading your papers  a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?","02","07","Swarley"
"7045","Marshall","Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.","02","07","Swarley"
"7046","Barney (stepping into the office, speaking with an Italian accent)","Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa...","02","07","Swarley"
"7047","Pr Lewis","Tell me what you want or get out.","02","07","Swarley"
"7048","Barney","Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.","02","07","Swarley"
"7049","Pr Lewis","Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.","02","07","Swarley"
"7050","Lily","I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.","02","07","Swarley"
"7051","Ted","He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean  crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop.","02","07","Swarley"
"7052","Robin","Did you show lily your design?","02","07","Swarley"
"7053","Ted","No.","02","07","Swarley"
"7054","Lily","What design?","02","07","Swarley"
"7055","Ted","It's nothing.","02","07","Swarley"
"7056","Robin","It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.","02","07","Swarley"
"7057","Lily","Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.","02","07","Swarley"
"7058","Ted","Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough!","02","07","Swarley"
"7059","Barney","Oh, my god. Incredible.","02","07","Swarley"
"7060","Pr Lewis","Hmm... C minus.","02","07","Swarley"
"7061","Barney","C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!","02","07","Swarley"
"7062","Pr Lewis","You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.","02","07","Swarley"
"7063","Lily","Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.","02","07","Swarley"
"7064","Ted","Okay, I'm done.","02","07","Swarley"
"7065","Lily","Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.","02","07","Swarley"
"7066","Ted","Great. Thanks.","02","07","Swarley"
"7067","Mr Druthers","Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.","02","07","Swarley"
"7068","Ted","Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.","02","07","Swarley"
"7069","Mr Druthers","Too green.","02","07","Swarley"
"7070","Ted","Too green?","02","07","Swarley"
"7071","Mr Druthers","Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?","02","07","Swarley"
"7072","Ted","I can't un-picture it.","02","07","Swarley"
"7073","Mr Druthers","Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!","02","07","Swarley"
"7074","Ted","What? What's gone?","02","07","Swarley"
"7075","Mr Druthers","My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.","02","07","Swarley"
"7076","Ted","Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.","02","07","Swarley"
"7077","Mr Druthers","What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.","02","07","Swarley"
"7078","Ted","Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.","02","07","Swarley"
"7079","Mr Druthers","Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.","02","07","Swarley"
"7080","Ted","Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)","02","07","Swarley"
"7081","Lily","Hey.","02","07","Swarley"
"7082","Ted","Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?","02","07","Swarley"
"7083","Lily","That's easy. I took it.","02","07","Swarley"
"7084","Ted","Why?","02","07","Swarley"
"7085","Lily","It's simple.","02","07","Swarley"
"7086","Mr Druthers","Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.","02","07","Swarley"
"7087","Mr Druthers (to a kid)","What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!","02","07","Swarley"
"7088","Lily","Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.","02","07","Swarley"
"7089","Ted","What does his ball have to do with anything?","02","07","Swarley"
"7090","Lily","Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.","02","07","Swarley"
"7091","Robin","Hey, guys. What's going on?","02","07","Swarley"
"7092","Ted","Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.","02","07","Swarley"
"7093","Robin","Why? Was he being mean?","02","07","Swarley"
"7094","Ted","You know about this?","02","07","Swarley"
"7095","Robin","Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?","02","07","Swarley"
"7096","Lily","Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.","02","07","Swarley"
"7097","Robin","I gave them to you for your birthday.","02","07","Swarley"
"7098","Ted","So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?","02","07","Swarley"
"7099","Lily","I prefer to call them ""justice khakis.""","02","07","Swarley"
"7100","Ted","That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.","02","07","Swarley"
"7101","Lily","So is being mean.","02","07","Swarley"
"7102","Ted","Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.","02","07","Swarley"
"7103","Lily","Well, that's why I left a note.","02","07","Swarley"
"7104","Ted","A note?","02","07","Swarley"
"7105","Lily","Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.","02","07","Swarley"
"7106","Ted","Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.","02","07","Swarley"
"7107","Lily","I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.","02","07","Swarley"
"7108","Marshall","I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.","02","07","Swarley"
"7109","Barney","I know, I know.","02","07","Swarley"
"7110","Marshall","You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.","02","07","Swarley"
"7111","Barney","Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.","02","07","Swarley"
"7112","Marshall","Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.","02","07","Swarley"
"7113","Barney","I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.","02","07","Swarley"
"7114","Barney","I think I'm falling in love with you.","02","07","Swarley"
"7115","Pr Lewis","Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.","02","07","Swarley"
"7116","Barney","What? No.We had s*x yesterday.","02","07","Swarley"
"7117","Pr Lewis","Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.","02","07","Swarley"
"7118","Ted","When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.","02","07","Swarley"
"7119","Lily","No.","02","07","Swarley"
"7120","Ted","What do you mean, no?","02","07","Swarley"
"7121","Lily","I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.","02","07","Swarley"
"7122","Ted","Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.","02","07","Swarley"
"7123","Mr Druthers","Everybody get in here now!","02","07","Swarley"
"7124","Lily","""Who wants espresso?""","02","07","Swarley"
"7125","Mr Druthers","Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note.","02","07","Swarley"
"7126","Lily","Interesting.","02","07","Swarley"
"7127","Mr Druthers","Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever ""allegedly"" did!","02","07","Swarley"
"7128","Lily","Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.","02","07","Swarley"
"7129","Ted","Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.","02","07","Swarley"
"7130","Lily","No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.","02","07","Swarley"
"7131","Ted","This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.","02","07","Swarley"
"7132","Lily","All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.","02","07","Swarley"
"7133","Ted","No. You'll give it back or you're fired.","02","07","Swarley"
"7134","Lily","I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.","02","07","Swarley"
"7135","Ted","Then you're fired.","02","07","Swarley"
"7136","Lily","Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.","02","07","Swarley"
"7137","Marshall","Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.","02","07","Swarley"
"7138","Barney","Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.","02","07","Swarley"
"7139","Marshall","So you're going back over there?","02","07","Swarley"
"7140","Barney","Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.","02","07","Swarley"
"7141","Barney","I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.","02","07","Swarley"
"7142","Pr Lewis","Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.","02","07","Swarley"
"7143","Barney","But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.","02","07","Swarley"
"7144","Pr Lewis","Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.","02","07","Swarley"
"7145","Mr Druthers","Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.","02","07","Swarley"
"7146","Ted","Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.","02","07","Swarley"
"7147","Mr Druthers","Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.","02","07","Swarley"
"7148","Ted","Lily was mentally deranged.","02","07","Swarley"
"7149","Mr Druthers","You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.","02","07","Swarley"
"7150","Ted","Lily was mentally deranged!","02","07","Swarley"
"7151","Mr Druthers","Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?","02","07","Swarley"
"7152","Man","The clients are here.","02","07","Swarley"
"7153","Mr Druthers","Excellent. Bring them in.","02","07","Swarley"
"7154","Ted from 2030","Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.","02","07","Swarley"
"7155","Mr Druthers","Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.","02","07","Swarley"
"7156","Client","That's a pen1s!","02","07","Swarley"
"7157","Mr Druthers","That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.","02","07","Swarley"
"7158","Client","We're not building a pen1s. You got any other ideas?","02","07","Swarley"
"7159","Mr Druthers","Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.","02","07","Swarley"
"7160","Client","Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here.","02","07","Swarley"
"7161","Ted from 2030","The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.","02","07","Swarley"
"7162","Ted","Wait! We have one more idea for you.","02","07","Swarley"
"7163","Mr Druthers","Ted, what are you doing?","02","07","Swarley"
"7164","Ted","I have another design.","02","07","Swarley"
"7165","Mr Druthers","Sit down, shut up right now.","02","07","Swarley"
"7166","Ted","No.","02","07","Swarley"
"7167","Robin","To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!","02","07","Swarley"
"7168","All","Probably!","02","07","Swarley"
"7169","Lily","Congrats, ted.","02","07","Swarley"
"7170","Ted","Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.","02","07","Swarley"
"7171","Lily","Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.","02","07","Swarley"
"7172","Ted","Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...","02","07","Swarley"
"7173","Lily","No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.","02","07","Swarley"
"7174","Lily","Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.","02","07","Swarley"
"7175","Robin","Barney! Oh, my god!","02","07","Swarley"
"7176","Ted","What happened?","02","07","Swarley"
"7177","Pr Lewis","He broke his hip.","02","07","Swarley"
"7178","Barney","That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.","02","07","Swarley"
"7179","Pr Lewis","No, he's not fine.","02","07","Swarley"
"7180","Marshall","Professor Lewis, hi.","02","07","Swarley"
"7181","Pr Lewis","Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.","02","07","Swarley"
"7182","Barney","Yeah, she was.","02","07","Swarley"
"7183","Pr Lewis","B plus.","02","07","Swarley"
"7184","Barney","B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""!","02","07","Swarley"
"7185","Marshall","Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.","02","07","Swarley"
"7186","Barney","It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!","02","07","Swarley"
"7187","Ted from 2030","And so, after six months apart, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall were finally back together.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7188","Lily","Oh, my God. These pancakes are delicious!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7189","Marshall","Yes! Thank you. Uhm, I learned how to cook while you were gone this summer.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7190","Lily","Oh. Do you want to cook dinner tonight?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7191","Marshall","Yeah, sure. How about pancakes?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7192","Ted from 2030","And things were back to normal... Almost.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7193","Lily","You may not have much range, but at least I'm marrying a guy who knows how to make pancakes.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7194","Marshall","Oh, uhm...","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7195","Lily","I mean, uhm... Well, I... I realize that we haven't really discussed whether us getting back together means us getting married, but... I still wanna. Do you still wanna?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7196","Marshall","Really?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7197","Lily","Of course, I love you.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7198","Marshall","No, I mean, that's how you're gonna do it? ""Do you still wanna?"" That's like the lamest proposal ever. When I did it, I got down on my knees... I don't know, I'm just saying.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7199","Lily (getting down on one knee)","Marshall Eriksen, will you ma...","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7200","Marshall","No, no, no, no, no, no.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7201","Lily","What?!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7202","Marshall","You can't lead with that. You got to... build up to that. You got to have, like, a little speech.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7203","Lily","Do you remember your proposal to me? (She puts her hand on her eye)","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7204","Marshall","I had a speech prepared.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7205","Lily","What do you want to hear?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7206","Marshall","I don't know. I mean, you could tell me, like, about how good-looking and funny and smart I am and I've been working out lately. It might be nice for you to mention something about that.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7207","Lily","Marshall... You are good-looking...","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7208","Marshall","Thank you.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7209","Lily","Funny...","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7210","Marshall","Oh, thanks.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7211","Lily","Smart...","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7212","Marshall","And a few tears wouldn't hurt.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7213","Lily","Okay, would you freakin' marry me already?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7214","Marshall","I'll marry you. Of course. But, uhm, until you see a ring on this finger, don't expect me to put out.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7215","Lily","Yeah, right. (They kiss)","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7216","Marshall","I'll give you this. That was a very creative use of syrup.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7217","Lily","I can't even look Mrs. Butterworth in the eye. Oh, my God. We're getting married!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7218","Marshall","I know, I know.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7219","Ted from 2030","It was a moment of happiness, followed of course by a moment of total panic. See, when they called off their first wedding, Aunt Lily took off for San Francisco leaving Uncle Marshall with the unfortunate task of telling his entire family.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7220","Lily","Man, I made a big mess by canceling this wedding, didn't I?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7221","Marshall","It's okay, baby. You're not just realizing that now, are you?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7222","Lily","God, the idea of standing up there in front of all those people who hate my guts... Just makes me want to run off to Atlantic City and get married today.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7223","Marshall","Yeah...","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7224","Robin","Coming up at 11 00  Are there piranhas in the East River? What you don't know... could eat you.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7225","Marshall","Robin! Stop the news!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7226","Woman","What the hell?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7227","Robin","It's okay. They're my friends.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7228","Lily","We're going to Atlantic City to elope. You got to come with us.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7229","Robin","Oh, my God, that is so fantastic! I don't know if I can just leave work.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7230","Woman","It's okay, Mike can read the news tonight. (To the cameraman) Hey, Mike... You can read, right?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7231","Mike","Yeah, I'm the best at reading.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7232","Robin","Let's go to Atlantic City!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7233","All","Yeah!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7234","Ted","You guys are eloping! Oh, that's fantastic. Wait, is this because there's a time crunch Uncle Ted should know about?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7235","Lily","I hope not because I plan on getting hammered.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7236","Ted","Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work. I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7237","Lily","Ted, for the rest of our lives, we are going to be telling the amazing story of how we went to Atlantic City and got married. Don't you want to be in that story?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7238","Ted","Of course I do. Let's go to Atlantic City!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7239","Marshall","Yeah!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7240","Ted","Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7241","Marshall","You got it.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7242","Barney","Hey, guys.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7243","Ted","Wow. A pedicure.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7244","Barney","Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7245","Lily","We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7246","Barney","Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7247","Marshall","So are you in or not?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7248","Barney","Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7249","Marshall","No, we got to get going to the...","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7250","Lily","Well, actually, I mean... It is my wedding day, and since we're here...","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7251","Ted from 2030","So we all got a pedicure and then headed down... to Atlantic City.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7252","Lily","Wow. Look at this place. I guess I'll have my pick of something old.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7253","Marshall","And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7254","Barney","Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7255","Ted","You been here before?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7256","Barney","Oh, uh, once or twice.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7257","Chinese 1","Barney!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7258","Barney","Ah, good to see you, too. Three times, maybe.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7259","Lily","The wedding chapel... This is it. Are you ready to do this?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7260","Marshall","I'm ready. Let's get married.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7261","Barney, Ted and Robin","Yeah.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7262","Lily","Oh, crap. I don't have a veil. I'm a bride, I can't get married without a veil. And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet. Oh, my God, we're getting married.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7263","Robin","Don't worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7264","Lily","Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7265","Robin","Oh, really? Thanks.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7266","Lily","Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride, you can't look better than me.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7267","Robin","Done. (She leaves)","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7268","Lily","I'm going to get the bouquet. You guys get the veil. We'll meet in the chapel in 20 minutes. Ready? Break. (She leaves)","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7269","Ted","You guys want to go gamble?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7270","Marshall","No, we got to go get the veil.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7271","Ted","Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7272","Marshall","Yeah, okay.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7273","Barney","No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil. (He leaves)","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7274","Ted","So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life. I'm proud of you, buddy.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7275","Marshall","Thanks.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7276","Ted","How are you feeling?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7277","Marshall","Great, a little nervous.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7278","Ted","Yeah? Craps?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7279","Marshall","Not that nervous.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7280","Ted","No, I mean do you want to play craps.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7281","Marshall","Oh, yeah, definitely.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7282","Barney","Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7283","Ted","What did you just say?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7284","Marshall","Barney, no.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7285","Barney","Marshall, I'm your best man.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7286","Marshall","You're not my best man.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7287","Ted","Right here.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7288","Barney","And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7289","Marshall","You're not my best friend.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7290","Ted","Right here.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7291","Marshall","Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party. I've got, like, 18 minutes.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7292","Ted","18 minutes...","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7293","Lily","Oh, good. Did you get the veil?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7294","Barney","Of course.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7295","Marshall","And it took us exactly 18 minutes. We went to a strip club.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7296","Ted","Dude!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7297","Barney","Unbelievable!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7298","Marshall","We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7299","Lily","Your last lap dance ever.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7300","Marshall","Right. What?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7301","Robin (arriving, wearing a ""shirt boobs"")","Okay, I'm here. Right?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7302","Ted","Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7303","Robin","Does it smell like strippers in here?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7304","Ted","That's weird, right? Marshall and Lily are getting married!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7305","Lily","Hell, yeah, look at this. (She turns on her musical bouquet, playing the Wedding March)","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7306","Marshall","Oh, baby, this is it. Let's do this thing.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7307","Lily","Hi. We're here to get married.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7308","Woman","Congratulations. We offer a variety of packages to give you the special day you've always dreamed about.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7309","Marshall","We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7310","Woman","Yeah. You know this isn't Vegas, right?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7311","Robin","Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen. Here, it looks like everyone brought their own.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7312","Ted (looking at Robin's shirt)","What?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7313","Woman","It also takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey. The earliest I could book you for is Monday.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7314","Lily","No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7315","Woman","Look, I don't know what to say, but if you guys don't want to book a wedding for Monday or play a round of keno, I can't help you. Thirty-five.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7316","Ted","Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7317","Woman","Yes, they do, but they don't elope. They choose Atlantic City for its white sand beaches, world-class amenities, and exotic Riviera feel.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7318","Lily","Have you been outside?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7319","Ted","There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7320","Marshall","You guys, take it easy, guys. Are you sure about this?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7321","Woman","About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7322","Barney","Bright side  the bachelor party continues!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7323","Ted","Yes! Continues? You mean ""start."" He means ""start."" We went to a strip club.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7324","Woman","Twenty-seven.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7325","Lily","Is there any way that we could get a license today?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7326","Woman","You could go to the courthouse. In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be waived, but you have to have a good reason.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7327","Lily","Well, we're in love.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7328","Marshall","What better reason could there be?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7329","Woman","The last one I heard was, ""I'm going to Iraq tomorrow to defend my country,"" but, you know, give yours a whirl.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7330","Ted from 2030","So we went to the courthouse.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7331","Marshall","God, this is taking forever.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7332","Robin (to Ted)","Can't believe they're getting married.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7333","Ted","I know. I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through. In fact, that crazy road has led them all the way here to Atlantic City...","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7334","Robin","Ted, up here.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7335","Ted","Uhm?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7336","Robin","You were just staring at my shirt boobs.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7337","Ted","No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7338","Chinese 2","Hey, it's Barney! Barney!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7339","Barney","Hi.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7340","Chinese 2","(speaks Chinese language)...suit up! (both speak Chinese language) Legen-...-dary!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7341","Barney","See you.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7342","Ted","What the hell was that?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7343","Barney","A... Chinese guy?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7344","Marshall","Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license, but we need to skip the waiting period because... We're in love.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7345","Woman 2","Aw. I'm gonna waive this waiting period right now.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7346","Lily","Oh, really?!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7347","Woman 2","Is what I would say if I could waive the waiting period, but unfortunately, only a judge can do that.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7348","Lily","Oh. Well, so can we see a judge?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7349","Woman 2","Absolutely.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7350","Lily","Really?!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7351","Woman 2","Is what I would say if there was any chance of you seeing a judge today, which there isn't.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7352","Marshall","Why are you doing this to us?!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7353","Woman 2","'Cause you're on Candid Camera!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7354","Robin","Really?!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7355","Woman 2","Is what I would say...","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7356","Marshall","You know what? We get it.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7357","Lily","Okay, this is a good plan B. Judges are people. People go to the bathroom. A judge is bound to come by eventually, and we'll get married. I'm sure we won't be waiting long.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7358","Marshall","Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7359","Barney","Vultures.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7360","Ted (to Robin)","Psst. (They move away)","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7361","Robin","What? Here?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7362","Ted","Yeah. Got a little time to kill.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7363","Robin","Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7364","Ted","No. A little.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7365","Robin","Something is seriously wrong with you.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7366","Ted","So what, is that a no?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7367","Robin","All right, let's do it.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7368","Ted","All right. Um, also...?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7369","Robin","Yes, I'll leave it on.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7370","Ted","Sweet.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7371","Barney","Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7372","Lily","Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7373","Barney","You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that bullet.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7374","Lily","Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7375","Judge","Turn it off.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7376","Lily","Okay. May we please get married today?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7377","Judge","Now, normally I would say no to a request like that, but you two impress me. Just the fact that you've been together for ten years, standing by each other's side through thick and thin, never wavering. What was that?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7378","Lily","What was what?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7379","Judge","That little look. What was that?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7380","Marshall","A look of love.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7381","Judge","You two have stood together through thick and thin, right?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7382","Marshall","You know, what's thick? what's thin?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7383","Lily","Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7384","Marshall","I have.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7385","Judge","All right, what was that look? What's going on?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7386","Barney","They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had s*x in the closet. What? We're under oath.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7387","Ted","No, we're not.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7388","Barney","Yeah, we are. He's a judge.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7389","Ted","Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7390","Barney","Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7391","Marshall","Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7392","Lily","No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7393","Marshall","Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7394","Lily","Except international waters. So let's find a ship captain. A ship captain can marry us. There's boats all over this place.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7395","Ted","Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7396","Lily","This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go. (To a woman) Excuse me. Are you a ship captain?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7397","Woman","This is my machine.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7398","Marshall","I should go talk to her.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7399","Robin","No, let me.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7400","Ted","Blackjack?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7401","Marshall","Yeah.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7402","Lily","Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip, so we're getting closer.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7403","Robin","Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7404","Lily","Because... If we don't do it today, I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people looking all disapproving and judging me while sipping little cups of mayonnaise and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7405","Robin","Nobody's gonna do that.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7406","Lily","No, they're not because I'm not gonna give them the chance. I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7407","Robin","Sweetie, this is crazy. You're never gonna find a ship capt...","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7408","Marshall","Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7409","Lily","What?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7410","Ted","Yeah. First guy we talked to. Ship captain. How great is that?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7411","Lily","See? See, this is destiny. So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7412","Captain","I sure can. If there's two things I love, it's bringing people together in marriage and making $5,000.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7413","Marshall","What?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7414","Lily","Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7415","Barney","I can get us that money.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7416","Ted","How?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7417","Barney","Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7418","Ted","Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7419","Barney","Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called ""Shing Hasabu Shing"". Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7420","Robin","No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7421","Barney","Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7422","Ted from 2030","Now, I had been to a lot of casinos before that night, and I've been to a lot of casinos since, but in all that time I've never seen a game quite like this one. To this day, I have no idea how it was played. But luckily, Barney did.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7423","Lily","Do you understand what's happening?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7424","Ted","Not a clue.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7425","Robin","Do you think he's winning?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7426","Ted","I don't even know if he's playing.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7427","Marshall","Wait, I get it. I understand this game.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7428","Ted","No, you don't.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7429","Marshall","I totally understand the game, Theodore. Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7430","Barney","Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm... My God, you're right.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7431","Lily","Wow. It's beautiful.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7432","Marshall","Thanks, Barney.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7433","Barney","Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7434","Ted","When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7435","Barney","Why can't I do it just a little?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7436","Lily","Okay. Let's get this started.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7437","Captain","Okay, uh... You guys want the serious one or the funny one?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7438","Captain","You sure? I got a lot of great nautical jokes in there. Like how you two float each other's boat, stuff like that.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7439","Marshall","Yeah, serious is probably good.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7440","Captain","""We stand witness today to celebrate the union of Lily and Marshall. Today, you two will become one, sharing your lives, the happiness, the sadness, the frustrations and the joy...""","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7441","Ted","This is pretty cool. I can't believe you never want to get married.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7442","Robin","I never said ""never.""","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7443","Captain","""...to declare your love and devotion to each other in front of friends and family, all the people who matter most to you."" What was that?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7444","Marshall","What was what?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7445","Captain","That little look. You two just shared a look.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7446","Lily","We don't want to do this.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7447","Marshall","We don't.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7448","Ted","Are you kidding me? You guys are calling off another wedding?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7449","Robin","After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7450","Barney","Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7451","Ted","You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7452","Lily","Yes. Because it's gonna be amazing. Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family and I didn't want to do all that work, but... Now that we're here... I realize that I have to face Marshall's family and I really want to do all that work.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7453","Marshall","So do I. And yeah... My family might still be upset with you. But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other and none of that other stuff is gonna matter.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7454","Lily","I love you, Marshmallow.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7455","Marshall","I love you, too, Lilypad.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7456","Captain","I now pronounce you man and wife.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7457","Lily","What?!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7458","Captain","Is that not right?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7459","Marshall","Are... we married? Did you just marry us? Weren't you listening? We don't want to be married.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7460","Captain","Uh... I-I suppose I could unpronounce you.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7461","Both Marshall and Lily","Unpronounce us! Unpronounce us!","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7462","Captain","All right, I unpronounce you man and wife.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7463","Lily","Oh, whew... That was close.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7464","Ted from 2030","And that's the story of how Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily got married for 12 seconds somewhere off the coast of Atlantic City.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7465","Ted (wearing Robin's shirt boobs)","Hey, guys.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7466","Marshall","Hey... Ted.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7467","Lily","Is Robin here?","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7468","Marshall","Man, I hope so.","02","08","Atlantic City"
"7469","Future Ted VO","...learn about relationships is that you're never done getting to know someone.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7470","Ted","You know how to make crepes? That is so cool.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7471","Future Ted VO","Some aren't as nice.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7472","Robin","And then there was Derek and counting you, that puts the total up to...","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7473","Ted","Oh, I got your total...counting along...","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7474","Future Ted VO","And some are just weird.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7475","Ted","You're scared of the Seven Dwarfs?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7476","Robin","Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7477","Barney","Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7478","Robin","Why?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7479","Barney","Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7480","Robin","No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7481","Barney","Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7482","Barney","Come on, let's go.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7483","Robin","All right, I'm in.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7484","Barney","To the Willowbrook Mall!","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7485","Ted, Marshall","To the Willowbrook Mall!","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7486","Robin","Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7487","Ted","What? Why not?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7488","Robin","I just don't feel like going to a mall.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7489","Lily","We can split a cinnabun.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7490","Robin","No, I'm really not gonna go.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7491","Ted","Come on, it'll be fun.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7492","Robin","No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7493","Barney","Why not?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7494","Robin","I'd rather not say.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7495","Ted","Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls. If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to. I think we should all just respect her privacy.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7496","Robin","Thanks Ted.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7497","Ted","So, what's the deal with you and malls?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7498","Robin","You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7499","Ted","Yeah, with those people. I'm your boyfriend. Come on, what is it? Did you get arrested in a mall?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7500","Robin","No.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7501","Ted","Dumped in a mall?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7502","Robin","Ted.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7503","Ted","Found out you were Canadian at a mall?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7504","Robin","Let it go.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7505","Ted","Trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Robin  Let it go.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7506","Ted","Mauled at the mall?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7507","Robin","Let it go. And who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Ted  Not me in Ohio when I was nine, that's for sure.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7508","Ted","What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7509","Barney","Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7510","Marshall","The 'oh' moment?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7511","Barney","Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7512","Girl #1","It's a promise ring. I made a pact with God to stay a virgin till I'm married.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7513","Barney","Oh.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7514","Girl #2","I don't have an eating disorder. It's just when I put food in my mouth, I chew it and then I spit it out.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7515","Barney","Oh.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7516","Girl #3","I just turned 30.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7517","Barney","Oh.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7518","Barney","So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7519","Ted","I disagree. If there's some potential 'oh' moment, I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7520","Priest","I now pronounce you man and wife.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7521","Ted","I love you.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7522","Robin","I used to be a dude.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7523","Lily","Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7524","Barney","You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7525","Ted","It's true. They tell each other everything.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7526","Barney","I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7527","Lily","Try me.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7528","Barney","Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7529","Lily","Doggie ate his pants. Yep.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7530","Barney","Bill's bachelor party in Memphis.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7531","Lily","Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7532","Barney","OK, Seattle.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7533","Lily","Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7534","Barney","Damn.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7535","Marshall","I'm not afraid of Sasquatch. I just think we should all be on alert.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7536","Ted","Trust me, not only do they tell each other everything. They want to know everything.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7537","Marshall","So, after the shower, I was brushing my teeth, and I was like, oh man, I wanted to have some orange juice, I should have done that first, but I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush so I just went ahead and brushed them anyway.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7538","Lily","What happened next?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7539","Barney","Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7540","Ted","You know?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7541","Barney","Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p0rn, wait for it, ography.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7542","Ted","Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7543","Lily","I don't know, he could be right. She does have the fake orgasm noises down.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7544","Ted","Hey.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7545","Lily","What? The walls are thin.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7546","Ted","That's not what I'm hey-ing you about.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7547","Marshall","You know what it might be. This is gonna sound a little crazy but what if robin's married?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7548","Ted","Married? What does have to do with the mall?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7549","Marshall","Well, maybe she got married at the mall. Back home in Minnesota a ton of people would get married at the Mall of America, it's great. It's a gorgeous indoor golf course for pictures. Numerous fine dining options, and talk about a reasonable price...","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7550","Lily","We're not getting married at the mall.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7551","Marshall","Just meet with the guy.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7552","Ted","She's not married. Robin hates marriage.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7553","Marshall","Because she already got married, at the mall.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7554","Lily","No, because before Robin moved to New York, she...What was she doing?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7555","Ted","Well, I don't know, whenever I ask her about Canada, she kinda clams up.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7556","Marshall","She's a pretty private person.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7557","Lily","Except when she's talking about...","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7558","Robin","A friend of mine in Canada got married way too young and it really turned her off to marriage.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7559","Lily","What do you think of this wedding cake?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7560","Robin","Oh, I like it. Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada who got married too young? Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Field's giant cookie.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7561","Lily","No.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7562","Robin","My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7563","Barney","They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7564","Ted","So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7565","Marshall","Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7566","Barney","Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7567","Ted","Thank you Barney.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7568","Barney","'Cause it's p0rn.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7569","Ted","I need another beer.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7570","Marshall","Robin is not in p0rn. I'll bet you anything that she's married.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7571","Barney","20,000 says it's p0rn.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7572","Marshall","I don't have 20,000.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7573","Barney","Well then, what do you have?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7574","Marshall","Well.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7575","Lily","No.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7576","Barney","I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7577","Ted","Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7578","Lily","What the hell's a slap bet?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7579","Marshall","Whoever's right gets to slap the other person in the face as hard as they possibly can, but no rings.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7580","Lily","Are you really gonna do that? That's so immature. Marshall  You can be Slap Bet Commissioner.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7581","Lily","Oh, I love it. What are my powers?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7582","Marshall","Um, if a problem arises and we need a ruling, that's your job. Barney  But you have to be unbiased and put the integrity of slap bet above all else. This is an honor you will take with you to your grave. On your tombstone, it will read ""Lily Aldrin, caring wife, loving friend, Slap Bet Commissioner.""","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7583","Marshall","And your tombstone will read, ""got slapped by Marshall so hard, he died.""","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7584","Ted","All right, what if I ask Robin point-blank if she has a husband?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7585","Lily","You said you would respect her privacy so maybe you should just drop it.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7586","Ted","Yeah, you're right.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7587","Ted","Husband.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7588","Robin","There's no 'p' in husband.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7589","Ted","Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7590","Ted","Fine, I'll take it back.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7591","Ted","Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7592","Robin","Huh.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7593","Ted","I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7594","Robin","Are you asking me if I'm married? Ted  You can ask me. Nope, I'm not married. Your turn.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7595","Robin","What happened to respecting my privacy? Ted  Just say, ""no, I'm not married.""","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7596","Robin","Ted, I don't understand why you can't...","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7597","Ted","Just say, ""no, I'm not married.""","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7598","Robin","I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7599","Ted","Oh.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7600","Ted","You have a husband? Robin  I was young and stupid and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall and I haven't been to a mall since.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7601","Ted","Why didn't you get divorced?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7602","Robin","He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7603","Ted","Good... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7604","Robin","I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7605","Ted","OK.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7606","Barney","Your hand is monstrous.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7607","Marshall","Well, what did you expect? You've seen my pen1s.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7608","Lily","I can't believe you told us Robin's secret.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7609","Ted","How can I keep something like that to myself? And you begged me to tell you.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7610","Lily","No I didn't.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7611","Lily","Please tell us, just tell us. I'm begging you. Tell us, tell us, tell us, please, please, please, please, please.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7612","Ted","Fine, Robin's married.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7613","Marshall","Ha ha ha.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7614","Lily","Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us. I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7615","Ted","See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7616","Barney","I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7617","Ted","What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7618","Lily","Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage. It's like their money or their army. Nobody takes it seriously.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7619","Ted","It's serious to me.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7620","Marshall","You know what, in some countries, if you've been separated for longer than five years, technicall, you're no longer married. I can check it out at the law library at school.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7621","Marshall","I can see my hand print on your face.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7622","Barney","Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of p0rn from Canada I have to go through.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7623","Marshall","I won the bet. Why are you still searching?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7624","Barney","Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7625","Lily","Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch p0rn.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7626","Barney","Canadian p0rn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go ""oat"" of my mind.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7627","Ted","Hey.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7628","Marshall","Hey. Listen, dude, I gotta talk to you, but you gotta promise me that you won't tell Barney.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7629","Ted","Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7630","Marshall","Robin's not married.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7631","Ted","What? Then, why would she tell me she was?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7632","Marshall","I don't know but I cross-checked every record in Canada. There's no record of her ever being married.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7633","Ted","There must be some mistake.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7634","Marshall","I promise you, she's not married. She's not great at parking legally either.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7635","Ted","So, she lied to me? What, what am I gonna do? I can't confront her 'cause then she'll know I told you.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7636","Marshall","You gotta lawyer her. You gotta ask her a bunch of questions, try to trip her up, maybe make her feel guilty, whatever it takes to get a confession out of her.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7637","Ted","Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7638","Robin","Thanks Ted.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7639","Ted","Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7640","Robin","I say we just move on.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7641","Ted","In order for me to get total closure on this whole my-girlfriend-has-a-husband thing, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more information. Like, what month did you get married? Robin  June. We had a June wedding.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7642","Ted","Ah, Canada in June. That's great.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7643","Ted","Sit down or buffet.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7644","Robin","Um...","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7645","Ted","Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7646","Robin","No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7647","Ted","Hm. Band of DJ?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7648","Robin","String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7649","Ted","How many bridesmaids? Robin  Seven.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7650","Ted","Flowers? Robin  Azaleas.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7651","Ted","Color scheme?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7652","Robin","Dusty rose and sienna.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7653","Ted","Husband's name?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7654","Robin","Um.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7655","Ted","You were never married.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7656","Robin","Yes I was.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7657","Ted","No you weren't.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7658","Robin","How do you know?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7659","Ted","I looked it up at the library.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7660","Robin","What library?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7661","Ted","The one on 5th.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7662","Robin","When did you go?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7663","Ted","Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad....","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7664","Robin","I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7665","Ted","I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7666","Robin","You told Marshall?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7667","Ted","You lied to me!","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7668","Robin","See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7669","Ted","But it was a fake secret.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7670","Robin","Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7671","Ted","Testing me, that's insane.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7672","Robin","Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7673","Ted","That wasn't a real secret.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7674","Robin","Yeah, but it could have been.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7675","Ted","You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7676","Robin","He moved there for business.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7677","Barney","You, you got something to say to me?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7678","Marshall","What are you talking about? Barney  I know Robin was never really married.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7679","Marshall","How could you possibly know that?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7680","Marshall","Uh, let's see. Uh, first, I took the subway to school, and I got a bagel. Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married. Crazy. And then I was hungry again so I went down to the vending machine...","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7681","Marshall","You told him? Lily  I had to. I'm Slap Bet Commissioner. Baby, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7682","Barney","Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7683","Lily","Barney gets three slaps.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7684","Marshall","Three?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7685","Lily","One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7686","Barney","Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall  No. You're gonna cry.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7687","Ted","I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7688","Robin","I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7689","Barney","So I just got a very interesting phone call.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7690","Ted","What are you talking about?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7691","Barney","I know Robin's secret.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7692","Robin","What?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7693","Barney","That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin  How do you know that name? Barney  'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7694","Barney","Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7695","Ted","Yeah. No I don't.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7696","Barney","What?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7697","Ted","Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7698","Barney","Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7699","Barney","Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7700","Robin","Barney, don't, okay.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7701","Barney","Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7702","Ted","No, Barney, I said we're not watching this.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7703","Robin","No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7704","Lily","Are you as terrified as I am?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7705","Marshall","I don't wanna get slapped again.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7706","Robin","I wanna stress that I was young.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7707","Barney","Yeah you were.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7708","Robin","And I didn't know any better.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7709","Barney","They never do.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7710","Robin","And it started out as an innocent modeling job.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7711","Barney","It always does.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7712","Robin Sparkles","Please, Mr. Johnson, I'm sorry I was a bad girl. Please don't give me detention. Isn't there something I can do to make it up to you?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7713","Ted","Oh my God.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7714","Barney","Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7715","Robin","What the hell was that?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7716","Ted","I slap bet Marshall that you did p0rn, so I win.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7717","Robin","p0rn? I wish it was p0rn, it would be less embarrassing.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7718","Robin Sparkles","I know, how about I sing you a song!","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7719","Robin Sparkles","Let's go the mall everybody! Come on, Jessica. Come on, Tori.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7720","Robin","I was a teenage pop star in Canada.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7721","Robin Sparkles","Put on your jelly bracelets and your cool graffiti coat. At the mall, having fun is what it's all about.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7722","Lily","This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7723","Marshall","That's you?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7724","Robin","Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7725","Robin Sparkles","Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7726","Marshall","This is the 90's. Why does it look like 1986?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7727","Robin","The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7728","Marshall","Taking a break from the first of many viewings, I can't help but notice that this isn't p0rn.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7729","Lily","And yet a slap occurred without the permission of the Slap Bet Commissioner.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7730","Marshall","Looks like someone suffered from premature slapulation","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7731","Ted","Oh my God, Robin's rapping. Guys, Robin's rapping.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7732","Robin Sparkles","Went to the mall with a couple of friends. Had a whole week's allowance to spend.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7733","Lily","OK, I'm going to give you a choice. Either ten slaps right now in a row or five slaps that can be doled at any point from here to eternity.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7734","Marshall, Ted","Cool.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7735","Ted","Go with the 10 now.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7736","Robin","No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7737","Ted","Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7738","Barney","I'm gonna go with the five for eternity.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7739","Robin","Good call.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7740","Ted","Horrible call.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7741","Marshall","Relax, dude, I'm just going for my soda, man. Take it easy. This is gonna be fun.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7742","Robin Sparkles","Let's go to the mall today! Everybody loves the mall","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7743","Lily","So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7744","Barney","Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin  I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7745","Ted","Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7746","Robin","You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7747","Lily, Marshall, Barney","Aw.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7748","Marshall","That's one.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7749","Robin Sparkles","Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today!","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7750","Barney","Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin  Yes.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7751","Robin Sparkles","There's this boy I like. Met him at the food court. He's got hair like Gretzky and he does jumps on his skateboard. I hope he asks me out. Take me to my favorite spot. It'll be just him and me.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7752","Robot","But don't forget the robot.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7753","Marshall","The robot! Hey!","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7754","Robin Sparkles","But, baby, I don't wanna wait.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7755","Ted","No, she doesn't wanna wait.","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7756","Robin Sparkles","I'm gonna rock your body anyway. I'm going to rock your body 'til Canada Day. Everybody, come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today! Today, today, today, today. Let's go to the mall (today). Let's go to the mall (today)...","02","09","Slap Bet"
"7757","Ted (V.O.)","Kids, there's nothing more wonderful than New York City in the winter... except the view of New York City in the winter through your apartment window.In the winter of 2006, Marshall, Lily, Robin and I were all deep in couple hibernation mode. Sadly, this left Uncle Barney out in the cold.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7758","Barney","Okay. All-night rave, abandoned tire factory in Newark. We're on the list. Who's in?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7759","Ted","- Nope.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7760","Robin","- No.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7761","Barney","Private jet. Teeterboro Airport, skinny-skydiving. Who's in?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7762","Ted","- Nope.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7763","Marshall, lily, Robin","- No, thanks.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7764","Barney","One beer. Bar, downstairs, 15 second walk. Who's in?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7765","Marshall","Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7766","Ted (voix off)","It got so bad, Barney tried to be his own wingman.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7767","Barney","Hi. Have you met me?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7768","Ted (voix off)","Finally, he decided to bring in reinforcements.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7769","Tous","- No.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7770","Barney","Yes. And do you know why? Hang on to your bedsores, grandparents from Willy Wonka, because guess who's on his way up to this apartment right now? My... wait for it... brother, James. React.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7771","Tous","- Hey!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7772","Robin","- You have a brother?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7773","Barney","- Yeah. He's the awesome-est, most best looking-est, greatest guy ever.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7774","Lily","He's exactly like Barney.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7775","Barney","That's what I just said.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7776","Ted","Well, Barney and his brother aren't exactly alike. James is gay.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7777","Robin","Really? I never in a million years would I picture you with a gay brother, that's awesome.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7778","Ted","Yeah. I just wanted you to have a heads up, so you don't act all surprised when he gets here.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7779","James","What up, New York.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7780","Robin","Thanks for the heads up.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7781","Robin","How in God's name did it never come up that Barney has a gay, black brother?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7782","Ted","Is he black? I guess I'm the kind of person that focuses on who people are on the inside rather than the color of their skin. I'm kidding, I just wanted to see your face.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7783","Marshall","Yeah, so now the wedding's back on.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7784","Lily","Anyway, James, how have you been?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7785","James","Awesome, as per ""yoozh."" I just went skinny-skydiving. Legendary. And my laser tag team, just made it to regional finals.""Legendarier."" And by now you've noticed the suit. go 'head, touch it. Handcrafted by Pietro Dellacamera, Milan's famous 101-year-old tailor who upon completing the very last stitch in this suit dropped dead, which is ironic because that is how gorgeous I look in it. C'mon. Gimme five.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7786","Barney","Is ""gimme five"" back?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7787","James","Oh, yeah. I put it in my blog this morning.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7788","Barney","Guys, ""gimme five"" is back!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7789","Ted","Oh, James, this is my girlfriend, Robin.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7790","Robin","- Hey. It's so nice to meet you.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7791","James","- You, too.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7792","Robin","So, I have to ask, there's a story here.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7793","Barney and James","Please.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7794","Ted (voix off)","The truth is, Barney and James got a lot of... different explanations from their mom over the years.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7795","Mere","Well, boys, you look different because when I was pregnant with you, I only ate vanilla ice cream. And when I was pregnant with you, can you guess what kind of ice cream I ate?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7796","James","- Coffee?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7797","Mere","- No, James, I ate chocolate ice cream. But I did drink tons of coffee when I was pregnant with both of you. Can't smoke without my coffee.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7798","Mere","I don't know, boys, I guess it's just one of those things.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7799","Mere","Stop asking me! You know what you two are? You're little racists!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7800","Ted","So what are you guys gonna do tonight?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7801","Barney","I'll tell you what James is gonna do. He's gonna do the job you've been neglecting. And, as always, he'll do it a lot better than you ever did. Ted... James is my wingman now.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7802","Ted","Okay.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7803","Marshall","Last time James was in town, Barney got slapped once, lucky twice, and... whose penthouse hot tub did you end up in?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7804","James","Ah, public figure, confidentiality agreement. But I will say this  way more back hair than any guy who can afford laser hair removal should have.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7805","Lily","And then there was the time they scored the brother/sister combo.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7806","Barney","It was everything we ever dreamed of when watching Donnie and Marie. She was a little bit country.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7807","James","He was a little bit way into black guys.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7808","Tes (voix off)","Yeah, Barney and James together was a lethal combination. Since there was never any crossover in targets, James was always there for Barney with the assist.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7809","James","Whoa. Your scarf... it is fierce!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7810","Women","Thanks. H & M.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7811","James","What? I would never know, 'cause it is so hot that my eyes are melting. Oh, I can't see. Hey! You know, speaking of things that would look good wrapped around you, have you met my straight brother, Barney? Oh, he is fab--don't you go nowhere-- ""ulous."" Okay?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7812","Ted (voix off)","And Barney always returned the favor.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7813","Barney","Help, I don't think he's breathing. Does anyone know mouth-to-mouth?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7814","Man","Oh, my God, I do!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7815","Barney","Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7816","Barney","Oh, man, I am so excited that you're here! It has been forever since I have been around anyone even remotely fun. Uh, yes offense.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7817","James","You guys are still going out with us tonight, right?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7818","Ted","- No.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7819","Lily","- Jammies.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7820","Marshall","Tonight? It's after 9 00 and...I have warm soup belly.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7821","James","Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys... you are young, attractive people here in the greatest city on earth. There are boys and girls in Nobody Cares, Wyoming, wishing they could be here. But instead, they are in someone's basement drinking bad malt liquor, debating whether or not they're going to spend their Saturday night in the parking lot of the feed store or in some other dude's basement. You owe it to them to rise up and shimmy your lazy asses into something hot, and you go out there and you live their dream!- Can I get a ""hell, yeah""?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7822","Tous","- Hell, yeah!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7823","James","Can I get a ""hell, yeah""?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7824","Tous","- Hell, yeah!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7825","James","Can I get a ""woo-woo""?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7826","Tous","- Woo-woo!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7827","James","Go do it for Wyoming!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7828","Tous","Yes!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7829","James","Testify!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7830","Ted (voix off)","So that night, Barney got his wish. We all went out.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7831","Barney","Daddy's home! Yeah. All right, bro. What do you like? Guy in super tight black T? Super tight black guy? Guy who looks like Mr. T?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7832","James","Mmm, yes, yes, and... talk to me after two martinis. Let's focus on you, my man.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7833","Barney","I'm feeling lazy. How 'bout girl with the chocolatini?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7834","James","Oh... boom, back tattoo. Hero and the pig?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7835","Barney","- Let's ride.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7836","James","- Fo' 'sho. Damn baby, nice tramp stamp!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7837","Women","- Get off me, you pig!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7838","Barney","- Hey! Hey! Her body art is not an invitation to grope her, it's an expression of her inner self. I'm sure, in many ways, she is the dolphin encircled by flowers.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7839","James","- What? What?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7840","Barney","- What? What?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7841","James","Cool.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7842","Barney","Let me know if he bothers you again.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7843","Women","Thanks. You should stay close... just in case.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7844","Barney","Sure. If it'll make you feel safer. I'm Barney.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7845","Ted (voix off)","Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy, crowded bar, you can always tell the difference between the singles and the couples. You just have to look for the signs.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7846","James","- Break.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7847","Barney","- Boiling hot.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7848","Ted (voix off)","Singles stay on their feet for maneuverability.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7849","James","- Hey! - Hi, how are ya?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7850","James and Barney","Have you met my brother?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7851","Barney","Oh, hello. Have a drink.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7852","James","Nice to meet ya.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7853","Ted (voix off)","Couples, exhausted by the sheer act of leaving the house, are obsessed with finding a place to sit down. There are a lot of other indicators, too. From choice of social lubricant...to basic body language. But the point is, there are many ways to tell whether someone has Single Stamina or Couples Coma.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7854","James","I wish I would've worn sneakers. I just got finished running from some fat, hairy guy who was periscoping out of his pleather pants. Permission to come aboard denied.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7855","Lily","I miss my jammies. I can't believe I wore a bra for this.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7856","Robin","Bras suck. They're so confining and unnatural.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7857","Lily","Yeah, they're like a boobie zoo.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7858","Man","Well, why don't you take it off then and let those puppies breathe?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7859","Lily","Oh, please go sweat on someone else.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7860","Marshall","Poor guy.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7861","Lily","Poor guy? Poor my boobs.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7862","Marshall","Well, it takes a lot of guts to approach a girl and you just crushed him.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7863","Lily","Oh, yeah, yeah. He looks all broken up inside.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7864","Robin","Whatever, you guys have no idea what it's like to be on the receiving end.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7865","Ted","""Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl and everybody everywhere wants to buy me drinks and have s*x with me."" Waa.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7866","Marshall","""Oh, poor me. I get to order yummy, pink drinks with chunks of real fruit that guys secretly like, but can't order because they'll be made fun of.""","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7867","Ted","- Dude.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7868","Marshall","- They're delicious!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7869","Man","Excuse me. Join me in a shot?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7870","James","Oh, no thanks. I've had enough. He's too in shape, we'd spend all night talking about his body fat content. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go have a yummy, pink drink with fruit in it... because I can.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7871","Lily","You know, that was, like, the third hot guy that James blew off tonight.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7872","Marshall","Yeah, he's turning down shots, he's yawning, he's whining about his feet. He's as bad as we are.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7873","Ted","He is. Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are. You guys don't think that James is... in a relationship?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7874","Robin","No. There's no way. He's Barney's brother.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7875","Marshall","Look at that. He's texting!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7876","Ted","Oh, my God! He is in a couple.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7877","Lily","This is gonna kill Barney.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7878","Barney","What's gonna kill me? What's going on?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7879","Marshall","B-Barney? Have you noticed anything...different about James?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7880","Barney","No. I mean, he's glowing from his peel, if that's what you mean.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7881","Ted","We have reason to believe that James is, uh, maybe hiding something from you. I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but... Barney... your brother is...monogamous.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7882","Barney","That's ridiculous! Just because he's a little sleepy, and he hasn't had s*x with anyone in a bathroom stall... He hasn't had s*x with anyone in a bathroom stall.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7883","Robin","And, Barney... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... he's texting.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7884","Barney","No, he... No! That... is impossible. Excuse... Excuse... Ex...","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7885","James","Hey, bro.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7886","Barney","Don't change the subject. Let me see your phone.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7887","James","Why?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7888","Barney","I just want to see your phone. Let me see your phone.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7889","James","No, it's just a phone. It's just a phone! And it's got Internet access, and it's got a camera on it, and you can surf the Web and do the whole thing. It's so amazing how far technology has come. What kind of phone do you have?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7890","Barney","I got... Who is this? And the answer better be  ""I don't remember his name.""","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7891","James","That is Tom. And he's my fiancé.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7892","James","Hey.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7893","Barney","I don't support this.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7894","James","Gay marriage?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7895","Barney","Not gay marriage-- marriage! How can you do this?We were raised in the same house, with the same values!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7896","James","Believe me, I fought this for a long time. Come on, it's embarrassing. Look, this felt unnatural to me, too, at first. But I fell in love. And Tom and I realized you can't fight love.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7897","Barney","Oh, God. Is that what you two do together? You sit around the house and talk about love? I think... I'm gonna be sick.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7898","James","Okay, okay, look,I need you to wrap your head around this, okay? Because it is happening. And I want you to be my best man.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7899","Barney","What? No way.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7900","James","Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. I hope you change your mind.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7901","Woman","Two beers, one shot.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7902","Barney","Oh, it's a freaking epidemic.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7903","Lily","Oh, sweetie! Did you make that for me?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7904","Marshall","Yes.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7905","Barney","Clam Bake. Staten Island. Who's in? Okay, I didn't have high hopes for that one. Okay, here's my thing. If gay guys start getting married, then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it. That's how it works. They start something, then six months later, everyone follows. Like now everyone gets manicures.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7906","Ted","I don't get manicures.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7907","Barney","Okay, then like how... Like getting your chest waxed.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7908","Lily","You get your chest waxed?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7909","Barney","You know what I mean! Gay marriage is going to cause single life, as we know it, to die out. Think of how the American family will be strengthened.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7910","Marshall","Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up and be a man about this.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7911","Barney","No. It's always been me and him together, being awesome, while the rest of you walked two-by-two onto your ark of sexless boredom.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7912","Marshall","Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7913","Barney","Yeah. Like things haven't changed with you people.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7914","Ted","Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like. Sandals and socks--come on, buddy. But I took her out, we celebrated. It was the right thing to do. You got to support him.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7915","Barney","You're right, Ted. This is a cause for celebration. We need to take him out and celebrate the commitment he and Tom are about to make.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7916","James","Yeah. This is where we're celebrating the commitment that Tom and I are about to make?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7917","Barney","What? Yeah! See, that cage represents your commitment.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7918","Marshall","Oh, my God. Freedom has never tasted so delicious.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7919","Man","Hey. You work out?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7920","Marshall","I do. And thank you for noticing. You're obviously in very good shape yourself.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7921","Man","Well, I try. So you want to dance?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7922","Marshall","You know what? I'm very flattered, and, objectively, you're a very attractive man, but this is actually my fiancée.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7923","Man","I'm sorry. You know, I saw your drink and I...","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7924","Marshall","No, no, this isn't my drink. This is hers.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7925","Lily","No, it isn't.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7926","Man","Whatever. How 'bout you?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7927","Ted","Oh, I'm straight, too. But I thank you for your time, and I appreciate your interest in my body.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7928","Marshall","You see that? Being hit on doesn't have to be terrible. I feel flattered, and everyone left with their dignity.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7929","Man","Hey, I really like your sweater.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7930","Robin","Wow. You actually do, don't you? You're not checking out my boobs or anything.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7931","Man","My name's Gay Ken, what do you think?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7932","Robin","I love this place! Let's dance!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7933","Lily","- And not be groped!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7934","Robin","- Whoo! Thank you.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7935","Ted","- Thank you!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7936","Marshall","- We're hot.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7937","Ted","- Totally.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7938","James","And then Tom says to the dealer that the handmade Georgian clock has a chip on the corner. Blam, we get that puppy half price. What up?! Bam!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7939","Barney","Sounds like you really rocked that arts and crafts fair.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7940","James","Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Hey, oh, my God. This is so liberating, being able to talk about this to you. I cannot wait for you to meet Tom.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7941","Barney","And I cannot wait for you to meet my good friend... this guy. Excuse me, do you know anyone who would like to buy my incredibly muscular, fun, large-handed brother a drink?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7942","James","Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you, Barnaby. Okay. All right. I spy a group of women who have let their defenses down because they are in a gay club. You see that chick right there? She looks like she'd fall for sports agent and football player.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7943","Barney","Okay, I'm in. Which one am I?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7944","James","Please.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7945","Barney","He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil, and drops his pants after three dirty martinis. Now go, man, go!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7946","Marshall","I just never thought I'd see Barney so vulnerable.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7947","Ted","Well, I guess no one wants to feel like they're going through the world alone.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7948","Man","Look at me, in a yummy sandwich!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7949","Marshall","Okay, we're actually right in the middle of something right now, so...","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7950","Man","Ooh, I know what I want to be in the middle of. Thoughts?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7951","Ted","God, can't two straight guys come to a gay dance club, enjoy some techno and good conversation without being bothered?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7952","Robin","How's it going, guys? Still enjoying the attentions of men?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7953","Marshall","That's like the eighth guy who's hit on us in ten minutes. It's like, hello,","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7954","Ted","And it's never the hot ones. It's always the losers. Bums me out!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7955","Lily","Looks like the boys learned their lesson. Do you totally miss being hit on?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7956","Robin","Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7957","Barney","James, James, since you like arts and crafts, look at what Charles here made with cherry stems. He did it with his tongue. Yeah.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7958","James","Barney.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7959","Barney","So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone, and once he's in a funner mood...","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7960","James","Barney, Barney, I don't want his number. I don't want anyone's number, okay? I'm getting married.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7961","Charles","Wow.- Best of luck to you both.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7962","James","- Thank you.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7963","Charles","My number's in here. I'm very discreet.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7964","James","Okay, okay, excuse me. Barney, family talk. Okay, dude, you have got to stop this, okay? I know that my getting married is threatening to your way of life...","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7965","Barney","Oh, so now it's my way of life? I thought it was our way of life. You've completely turned your back on it. Look at you, not even suited up. Do you remember why we suit up, James?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7966","James","To get laid.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7967","Barney","To show people that we are different from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there. The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with, a two-person army that plays by its own rules. But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines, and you've abandoned me. Well, I'm not gonna let you do that. It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing! You don't have to do this, bro!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7968","James","- Yes, I do.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7969","Barney","- Why?!","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7970","James","Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7971","Barney","What? There's gonna be a baby?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7972","James","Yes. We're adopting.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7973","Barney","Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7974","James","For the rest of your life.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7975","Barney","To James and Tom. May you have a long and happy life together. And may I always have the skin and libido of a much younger man.- Cheers.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7976","Tous","- Cheers.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7977","Barney","Thanks. I decided to leave out the hetero college phase. No one wants to","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7978","Lily","It was perfect. You even made Tom's dad cry. Might have been doing that because he's a Republican.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7979","Marshall","Whoa. It's 9 00. We should be getting back. You guys want to split a cab?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7980","Ted","Uh, no, I think I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7981","Robin","Yeah, me, too. I'm not tired at all.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7982","Marshall","All right, well, it's getting late. Got to get the wife home.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7983","Lily","Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7984","Barney","Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7985","Barney","- May I?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7986","James","- Yeah.","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7987","Barney","Hey, buddy. Your parents are married. Now, listen, you. Just because you're being raised by married people doesn't mean you have to choose that lifestyle. High-five. Luckily, you got me. In 20 and a half years, you'll be 21, and I will be... Well, I haven't decided how old I'll be yet. But we are gonna bro out, uncle and nephew style. Stick with me, kid. I am gonna teach you how to live. Great suit, by the way. Who is the cutest?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7988","Rosa","I don't get it. Tom liked my breasts in tenth grade. Why doesn't he like them now? Why?","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7989","Barney","Rosa, why always be attracted to the unavailable ones? Why not accept the fact that you're a beautiful woman who is worthy of love? Are you brave enough to hear that? You...","02","10","Single Stamina"
"7990","Ted (V.O.)","Kids, as you know, Christmas is a time you spend with your family. So in December of 2006, I had three options. Spend it with my mom and her new boyfriend Clint, spend it with my dad and his new girlfriend micro-brewing, or head down to Staten Island to spend it with my super religious cousin Stacy and her family. So I opted for none of the above and decided to spend Christmas 2006 in Manhattan... celebrating with my other family.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"7991","Marshall","Okay, I have one last paper due at 5 00 p.m. today, so until then, I will be at the law library at school, but I'm not to be disturbed for any reason.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"7992","Ted","Dude, open your eyes. You're going to hurt yourself.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"7993","Marshall","No, no. Christmas Eve winter wonderland is my reward for finishing my paper. Baby, do I smell your Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"7994","Lily","Yes.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"7995","Marshall","Damn me and my heightened other senses. Must be strong. Okay, I'll be back here at 5 00. Save me at least 20 cookies and do not clean the bowl. Was that a reindeer? I don't want to know!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"7996","Lily","Hey, look. Our old answering machine.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"7997","Ted","Oh, yeah. After you left, we, uh, we unplugged it because it reminded Marshall of how you used to, you know, leave messages. But hey, you guys are back together. I say we're plugging it back in. It's good to have you back.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"7998","Lily","Thanks. Oh, hey, look, there's still some messages on here.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"7999","Ted's father","Hey Ted, it's Dad calling to check in. I'm going fishing this","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8000","Ted","Yes, same Clint.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8001","Ted (voix dans le répondeur)","Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the couch right now moping about Lily? You are, aren't you? Well, stop it. She's not worth it. You gotta get over that Grinch.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8002","Ted (voix off)","But I didn't say ""Grinch."" I said a bad word. A very, very bad word.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8003","Ted","Oh, fudge.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8004","Ted (voix off)","But I didn't say fudge.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8005","Lily","I'm... a what?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8006","Ted","I-- That was Barney, that was Barney.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8007","Lily","That was you, Ted.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8008","Ted","That was Marshall.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8009","Lily","Marshall left a message for Marshall?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8010","Ted","You know, it may have been me, but it was so long ago. Man, that machine, it really garbles your voice.You know, it almost made it sound like I said...","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8011","Lily","Why would you call me that?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8012","Ted (voix off)","It was a fair question. Marshall's breakup with Lily had sent him into a deep depression and nothing could get him out of it. Until one day...","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8013","Marshall","She was perfect. I lost the perfect woman. I should have knocked her up when I had the chance.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8014","Ted","Okay. That's it. You're never going to get over her until you stop putting her on a pedestal. So no more ice cream until you tell me one thing that's wrong with Lily.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8015","Marshall","There's only one of her?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8016","Ted","Okay. She called off your wedding and dumped you to be a painter in San Francisco. What do you call that?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8017","Marshall","Fiercely independent? Brave? I guess it was a little selfish.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8018","Ted","There you go.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8019","Ted (voix off)","And in almost no time, that spark turned into a roaring fire.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8020","Marshall","Yeah. No, you're right. Lily would laugh at anything.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8021","Barney","She'd give it up for a bad pun. I'm telling you, she's a laugh slut.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8022","Ted","Remember that time we heard her laughing and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's, but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8023","Barney","And her art? ""I'm Lily, I'm an artist."" She doesn't even own a beret.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8024","Marshall","Yeah, and if she's such a great ""artist,"" why does she suck at Pictionary? Who draws a ninja star like a Star of David? Right, right?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8025","Ted","Yeah!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8026","Marshall","Another round!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8027","Ted","I was trying to help him. I'm his best friend. That's the best friend's job.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8028","Lily","The best friend's job is to call me that word?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8029","Ted","Yeah.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8030","Robin","Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy boy.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8031","Ted","Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8032","Barney","Then why don't you say it now?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8033","Ted","Grinch. You timed that didn't you?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8034","Barney","Perfectly.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8035","Robin","Well, at least you apologized. You apologized, didn't you?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8036","Ted","Oh, yeah. ""I'm sorry"" were the first words out of my mouth.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8037","Ted","I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing. I was just trying to put the guy back together. You smashed him to pieces.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8038","Lily","Are you seriously not going to apologize for leaving that message?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8039","Ted","No!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8040","Lily","Why not?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8041","Ted","Because, Lily, this summer, you were kind of a Grinch.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8042","Lily","Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8043","Barney","Ted Vivian Mosby!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8044","Ted","That's not my middle name.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8045","Barney","Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8046","Ted","Like you've never said that word.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8047","Barney","I don't kiss your mother with my mouth. Yet. (Barney sneezes)","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8048","Ted","Are you sick?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8049","Barney","Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8050","Ted","No, I meant do you have a cold?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8051","Barney","I'm fine. I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome and I had to get some of it out. Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time when people are lonely and desperate. It's the most wonderful time of the year.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8052","Ted","I should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8053","Robin","Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses? If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8054","Barney","I don't see any mistletoe, but... (He sneezes on her)","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8055","Woman","Oh! Oh, God!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8056","Barney","Uh... ""Bless you"" would have been nice.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8057","Robin","You're sick.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8058","Barney","I'm not sick.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8059","Robin","You're sick.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8060","Barney","You know what? I am sick. Sick of you telling me I'm sick. What up?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8061","Ted","Ahh... Three flights of stairs, not a drop spilled. Hey, buddy.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8062","Robin","You sure this is gonna work?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8063","Ted","Yeah, this is our thing. In college, whenever I wanted to make up with her, I'd buy her a beer. Cute, right?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8064","Robin","Totally. Plus free mug.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8065","Ted (voix off)","Usually that would've done the trick, but it turned out this was a problem not even alcohol could solve. Actually the beer helped a little.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8066","Ted","She took the decorations. She took the decorations! What a Grinch!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8067","Ted (voix off)","That time I did say ""Grinch.""","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8068","Ted","All right. I guess I have to call her, right? Lily's cell phone. She'll listen to reason-- right? Oh, hey, Billy. Actually, funny thing--the voice dial got you. I was trying to call... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. (20 minutes later) Yeah, the holidays are a rough time for everyone, Billy. Okay, yeah, dinner next Wednesday. Okay. Damn voice dial.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8069","Robin","Barney! What the hell are you doing? Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8070","Barney","Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive ""no cigars in the apartment rule."" God, it's like Marshall's marrying the Taliban. (he sneezes on his hand). High five.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8071","Robin","Eww. No. You have to go home and get to bed.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8072","Barney","Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north, let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body. You see, whenever I start feeling sick, I just stop being sick and be awesome instead. True story. Yeah, in two minutes, I'm going to pound a sixer of Red Bull, hop in a cab, play a couple of hours of laser tag, maybe get a spray-on tan. It's gonna be legen... Wait for it... (Barney falls asleep)","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8073","Ted","Lily!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8074","Lily","Merry Christmas, assface.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8075","Ted","Um, Lily? Where are the Christmas decorations?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8076","Lily","At my apartment.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8077","Ted","You want to bring them back so we can celebrate Christmas together-- please?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8078","Lily","Ted, do you know what I would do if one of my kindergartners used that kind of language? I would be on the phone with their parents.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8079","Ted","Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8080","Lily","Exactly. You know what that word means. You know that calling people names is mean and hurtful... assface.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8081","Ted","Lily, if you don't bring that stuff back right now, we...","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8082","Ted to Robin","She hung up.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8083","Robin","She's just mad. She'll cool down.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8084","Ted","Lily...","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8085","Lily","Don't forget to take the cookies out of the oven... assface!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8086","Ted","Damn it! I could be in Cleveland right now making peppermint lager with my dad.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8087","Robin","Where are you going?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8088","Ted","Marshall gets home in three hours. He's gonna show up--no Lily, no winter wonderland.I gotta get up to the Bronx.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8089","Barney","...dary.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8090","Ted","Hey, dude, how's the paper going?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8091","Marshall","Screw the paper, how's the winter wonderland? Is it magical?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8092","Ted","Oh... so magical.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8093","Marshall","When you walk through the door, does it feel like you've been slapped in the face by Christmas?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8094","Ted","Sure does. Look, I gotta go.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8095","Marshall","Come on, man, describe it! Tell me about the decorations. Is Rudolph there? He is, isn't he? Hi, Rudolph!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8096","Ted","Ah, yeah, but, you know... decorations, is that really what Christmas is about?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8097","Marshall","Hell, yeah! What else would it be about?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8098","Ted","Uh, try the birth of Christ. You know, Christmas-- Christ Mas, which means ""More Christ"" to our Spanish friends.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8099","Marshall","Yeah, well, all I know is walking in that door and seeing the winter wonderland and seeing Lily and all you guys, just... I can't wait.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8100","Ted","Right. I gotta go.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8101","Marshall","Right. Okay.Oh, wait. Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted. One more thing. How about the cookies? Are they delicious?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8102","Ted","You know, honestly, they taste a little store-bought. Oh! I got another call.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8103","Marshall","Well, tell Lily I love her.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"

"8105","His mother","Ted Evelyn Mosby!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8106","Ted","Oh. Uh, hey, Mom. Merry Christmas.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8107","His mother","I just got the most disturbing call from Lily. How could you use such a horrible word?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8108","Ted","Oh, God, she called you?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8109","His mother","Are you acting out because of the divorce? Is-is this all about Clint?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8110","Ted","No, Mom, why would it be about Clint?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8111","Clint","Hey, buddy, it's Clint. How you doing, champ?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8112","Ted","Hey, Clint. Listen, um, I don't really have time to...","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8113","Clint","Hey, hey, no, no, no. Ted, Ted. You don't know this yet, but you and I are going to be great friends. Now, the Native Americans have this ritual...","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8114","Barney","This is a low moment for the Barnacle. I should be off playing laser tag right now, but instead... Don't look at me. I'm hideous.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8115","Robin","You just look like a regular guy.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8116","Barney","Exactly. I'm a Ted. I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8117","Robin","And isn't it more comfy?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8118","Barney","Yes.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8119","Robin","Come on, you need eat something.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8120","Barney","Too weak... to hold... bowl.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8121","Robin","Fine, I'll feed you.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8122","Barney","Ouchie in my mouth! I don't want it. I want ice cream.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8123","Robin","No, you're not having ice cream for dinner just 'cause you're sick.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8124","Barney","But my throat hurts.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"

"8130","Lily","Hey, you tricked me.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8131","Ted","You really thought I was the pizza delivery guy?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8132","Lily","No, I knew it was you. I just thought you'd at least bring a pizza.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8133","Ted","Yeah, well, I brought a beer, but I gave it to a homeless guy. All right, he took it from me. Now, will you please come home?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8134","Lily","No, I'm not spending Christmas with you.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8135","Ted","Okay, I'm sorry for calling you a... that word, over the summer, and for saying it again today. And for thinking it a lot on the subway ride over. I had no right to say that. It was hurtful and immature and I'm sorry.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8136","Lily","Oh, shut up. You think I don't know your fake apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh? You're clearly still mad at me.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8137","Ted","I'm not mad at you.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8138","Lily","Yes, you are.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"

"8140","Lily","I've apologized to Marshall and he's forgiven me and we've moved passed it. Why can't you?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8141","Ted","Because you never apologized to me. Marshall's not the only one you walked out on. You leave for three months, you don't even call. Come on, Lily, we're supposed to be friends!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8142","Lily","Yeah, some friend, you called me a Grinch.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8143","Ted","You were a Grinch!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8144","Lily","How can you...","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"

"8148","Voice","You use that language again and I'll turn off your water!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8149","Lily","That's my super. He lives above me. Great. Thanks to your filthy mouth, now I'm going to have Christmas alone in the dark.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8150","Ted","Fine. I don't want to ruin Christmas. You can have the apartment. Don't worry about seeing me there I'll be in Staten Island with my cousin Stacy. Just.... Merry Christmas.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8151","Robin (on the phone)","You're spending Christmas Eve with your family? Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8152","Ted","Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird. You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees. And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name when he wants to trick us.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8153","Robin","Well, do you want me to go with you?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8154","Ted","Was that a sincere offer?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8155","Robin","First tell me your answer.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8156","Ted","Stay there. Save yourself. We'll spend all day together tomorrow. Okay. Oh, how's Barney feeling?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8157","Robin","You mean the whiney bottomless pit of neediness? He was bugging me, so I spiked his echinacea tea with codeine.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8158","Ted","You're gonna be a great mom.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8159","Marshall","Holy crap, the magical Christmas season is upon us. And thank God we don't pay for utilities.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8160","Lily","Merry Christmas! What's in the box?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8161","Marshall","Only the best present for the best girl ever. It took me all day to track it down.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8162","Lily","I thought you were writing a paper.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8163","Marshall","Ah, naw, I blew that off. I'll get an extension. School's not important. What is that pitter patter on the roof? Could it be the sound of an awesome Christmas story about to come down the chimney? Why, yes, it is. 'Twas the day before Christmas...","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8164","Marshall","It was supposed to arrive, like, five days ago, but then it got lost and rerouted. I checked two other branches, finally they told me it was here.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8165","Women","Yeah, all I needed to know was the tracking number. Looks like it's headed out to our regional branch in Poughkeepsie.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8166","Marshall","What?No, no, no, no,I need that package today.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8167","Women","Listen, the truck already left five minutes ago so unless you want to run after it...","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8168","Marshall","Stop! Stop! Stop, please, stop. Stop. Stop the truck. I need a package on your truck. Can I please take a look in back?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8169","Truck driver","Sure. But I gotta keep driving my route. I'm running behind.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8170","Truck driver","My bad.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8171","Marshall","I'm okay. (out of the truck) Hey, man, thanks for helping me make my fiancee's Christmas.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8172","Truck driver","No problem. Too bad I can't deliver all these packages by the end of the day.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8173","Marshall","Wait, so some people aren't going to get their gifts in time for Christmas?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8174","Truck driver","Sadly, no.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8175","Marshall","We delivered every single package on that truck. But I still have one package left to give. Yeah, I did. Merry Christmas. Open it, Baby.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8176","Lily","Okay. Oh, my God. An Easy Bake Oven! I've wanted one of these ever since I was a little girl. In this exact model. I never told you that. How did you know?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8177","Marshall","It's our first Christmas since we got back together. I want to get her something really special. So I'm getting her a jukebox.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8178","Ted","Wow, that's a great gift.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8179","Marshall","Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8180","Ted","Oh, man, I know something you could get her that would blow her mind. Ready? Eight years ago...","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8181","Lily","When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven. I begged and I begged, but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8182","Ted","Easy Bake Oven--that's what I'm going to call my van.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8183","Ted","Dude... how was the concert?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8184","Marshall","I couldn't find the outside.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8185","Lily","I can't believe Ted remembered after all these years.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8186","Marshall","Yeah, and after all that weed. Where is he anyway?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8187","Lily","Staten Island.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8188","Marshall","Why?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8189","Ted","Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8190","A kid","Like the gift of God's love?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8191","Ted","No, dude, real presents.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8192","Kid","Uncle Ted got us presents!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8193","Stacy","That's okay, Ted, we'll just give them to charity.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8194","Charity","Yay!","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8195","Stacy","Uh, not you, Charity. I meant the less fortunate. Ted, how would you like to say grace tonight?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8196","Ted","Uh, you know what, why don't you say it. I really wouldn't know what to say.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8197","Charity","Why don't you recite your favorite passage of scripture.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8198","Ted","That's a great idea, Charity. But, really, I don't know. I mean how do you choose your favorite passage? It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones... That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool. Doorbell rings. Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8199","Charity","Dear, Father, thank you for this day, and thank you for bringing this family together. Amen.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8200","Stacy","Who is it, Ted?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8201","Ted","Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers. Marshall starts singing. Robin and Barney follow.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8202","Lily","I came here to apologize. I'm so sorry, Ted.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8203","Ted","I accept. Give me the beer. it is so good to see you guys.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8204","Lily","Are you coming home?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8205","Ted","Totally. But first, Lily, I owe you an apology.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8206","Lily","Oh, for the love of God, are you as sick of apologies as I am?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8207","Ted","Yes","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8208","Lily","Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8209","Ted","Yes. And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8210","Lily","That's okay. I was kind of a Grinch.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8211","Ted","Nothing. It's something you shouldn't say.","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"
"8212","Kid","Mom, what's a Grinch?","02","11","How Lily Stole Christmas"

"8219","Ted (voix off)","Well, here's the thing, normal people, you know, people who aren't your dad, usually take longer to say ""I love you."" Robin went through the usual stages.","02","12","First Time in New York"

"8221","Barney","I left something in the hallway.","02","12","First Time in New York"

"8231","Ted (voix off)","There's the moment where you know you know it, but you can't yet say it.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8232","Ted","All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8233","Robin","Good night.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8234","Ted","Good night.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8235","Robin","Wait, Ted?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8236","Ted","Yeah?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8237","Robin","Good night.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8238","Robin","Well, great, I'll see you then. Bye, sweetie. (To Ted) Hey. Guess what? My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend. She gets in on Thursday.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8239","Ted","That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8240","Robin","Really? You'd do that?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8241","Ted","Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8242","Ted (voix off)","And then there's the moment where you know you know it, and you can't keep it in any longer.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8243","Robin","Ted.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8244","Ted","Yeah?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8245","Robin","Falafel.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8246","Lily","Falafel?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8247","Robin","Falafel.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8248","Lily","Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said ""falafel""?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8249","Robin","I totally choked.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8250","Lily","I just don't get it. Why can't you tell Ted you love him?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8251","Robin","Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8252","Lily","Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before. No.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8253","Robin","Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8254","Lily","Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8255","Barney","Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8256","Marshall","Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8257","Barney","No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have s*x, you exit when she's in the shower.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8258","Robin","So every girl you have s*x with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8259","Barney","The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8260","Ted","What?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8261","Barney","Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, ""Are we there yet?""","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8262","Robin","So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8263","Lily","Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8264","Robin","It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8265","Lily","Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8266","Robin","Oh, here comes Katie.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8267","Lily","Aw, your sister's so cute.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8268","Robin","Yeah. This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school, with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8269","Lily","Hello, Kitty.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8270","Robin","Oh, no. No. No. No.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8271","Katie","Hey, Robin. How are you?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8272","Robin","Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8273","Katie","Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8274","Kyle","Looks like hotness runs in the family.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8275","Robin","Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8276","Katie","Two whole months.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8277","Kyle","Yeah.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8278","Katie","He's actually coming to visit family in New York, too. Isn't that great?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8279","Kyle","My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad, but he buys me beer, so...","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8280","Robin","That's cool. This is my friend Lily.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8281","Kyle","Hot.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8282","Robin","You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8283","Katie","Um, actually, I'm going to stay with Kyle tonight.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8284","Robin","Uh, no, you're not.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8285","Katie","Oh, come on. It's kind of a special night. If you know what I mean.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8286","Robin","What? Oh. Oh...","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8287","Robin ","I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a......douche with a faux hawk. This can't happen. You guys have to help me talk her out of it.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8288","Marshall","Speech to talk a girl out of having s*x.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8289","Ted","Yeah, I don't have any of those.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8290","Barney","Discouraging premarital s*x is against my religion.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8291","Robin","Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8292","Lily","It's 2 00 and you've already had three scotch and sodas.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8293","Robin","That's why I need your help.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8294","Ted (voix off)","Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night. And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8295","Ted","You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8296","fact number one","When construction began on March 17, 1930, the framework rose at a rate of four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. There it is. There it is. Come on. These are fun facts, guys, let's have fun with them.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8297","Robin","You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8298","Katie","Oh, here we go.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8299","Lily","Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either. But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancee.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8300","Marshall","Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school. It's totally cool to wait. And stay away from drugs... other than pot.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8301","Katie","You told them?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8302","Robin","Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8303","All","Totally. You should wait.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8304","Barney","s*x is fun.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8305","Robin","See?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8306","Katie","You are such a hypocrite. You were only 16 when you lost yours.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8307","Robin","Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8308","Barney","I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8309","Katie","Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now. It's like forever. I mean, we've already done everything else. I mean, we've even...","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8310","Robin","Oh. La, la, la, la, la.La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la, la, la, la.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8311","Marshall","Even Kyle gets to do that.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8312","Katie","You have no right to tell me not to do it.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8313","Robin","But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8314","Katie","Robin, this is happening. Look, I already put it up on my Myspace page. I need a clove.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8315","Robin","You smoke now, too?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8316","Lily","Oh, remember cloves?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8317","Marshall","No!","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8318","Robin","No ""Aw, remember cloves?"" This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having s*x.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8319","Ted","Come on, you were only 16 when you had s*x. I was 17.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8320","Marshall","We were 18.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8321","Ted","Barney was probably 12.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8322","Barney","Good one, Ted. I was, uh, six... fourt... How old were you again?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8323","Ted","17.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8324","Barney","Dude, me, too.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8325","Lily","Barney, you okay?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8326","Barney","Yeah, of course. What, you don't believe me? - It was at camp, so I'm...","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8327","Marshall","What camp?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8328","Barney","This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8329","Robin","What did you teach?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8330","Barney","Uh, dance.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8331","Ted","Dance?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8332","Barney","Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8333","Barney","Sylvia","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8334","Sylvia","Yes, Mickey?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8335","Barney","How you call your loverboy?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8336","Sylvia","Come here, loverboy","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8337","Barney","And if he doesn't answer","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8338","Sylvia","Oh, loverboy","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8339","Barney","And if he still doesn't answer?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8340","Sylvia","I simply say, baby... Oh, baby. My sweet baby","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8341","Lily","That's Dirty Dancing.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8342","Ted","It was on last night.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8343","Marshall","No, it was two nights ago. ""She's Like the Wind"" has been stuck in my brain for about 40 hours. I just got it out. Now it's back in. Damn you, Swayze!","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8344","Lily","Do you remember our first time?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8345","Marshall","Yeah. It was back in college.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8346","Lily","Oh, wait, wait. Look... I really want to do this, but... we should make it special, you know? Do this right.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8347","Marshall","Okay. You're right. Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8348","Lily","Yeah, New Year's Eve.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8349","Marshall","Okay.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8350","Lily","Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8351","Marshall","That's not a good idea.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8352","Lily","Why not?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8353","Marshall","Long story. But maybe we could put on some Al Green and take a bubble bath together.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8354","Lily","Oh, yeah, that sounds so good. Oh, I love you, Marshall. I'm so glad we're waiting. (12 minutes later)  Oops. End of flashback.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8355","Robin","Oh, that's adorable.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8356","Ted","Yeah, tell her what happened next.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8357","Marshall","That was amazing.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8358","Lily","Yeah. Want to do it again?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8359","Ted (on the bed of the top)","Please don't. End of flashback.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8360","Marshall","We said we were sorry.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8361","Ted","Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8362","Marshall","You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8363","Lily","The point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8364","Robin","Well, mine was terrible.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8365","Lily","Wait, I've never heard your story.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8366","Robin","Well, as you know, I was 16. And it was with my boyfriend Brian.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8367","Brian","Ready?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8368","Robin","Yeah.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8369","Brian","This feels so right.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8370","Robin","Oh, I know.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8371","Brian","Oh, Robin.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8372","Robin","Oh, Brian.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8373","Brian","Yeah, I'm gay. End of flashback.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8374","Lily","I'm so sorry.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8375","Robin","Eh, I should've known. There were signs.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8376","Brian","Oh, my God! My mom's home. Quick! Get under my bed.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8377","Robin","What?! Oh, my God!","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8378","Robin","You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had s*x, it counts.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8379","Lily","What do you mean just barely?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8380","Robin","Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8381","Lily","Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8382","Robin","Yes, it does.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8383","Lily","No, it doesn't.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8384","Marshall","Yes, it does.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8385","Lily","No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8386","Barney","Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot. Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8387","Marshall","No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8388","Barney","Who's Scooter?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8389","Lily","My high school boyfriend, who I did not have s*x with.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8390","Marshall","I... I can't believe this. We're Marshall and Lily, when people see us, they say, ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other.""","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8391","Barney","No, Marshall, they say, (with a sad voice) ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other.""","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8392","Marshall","But now that's not true anymore, now you've had s*x with twice as many people as I have. I knew that you were too good at it.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8393","Katie","Know what? I don't want to see the stupid Empire State Building anymore.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8394","Ted","It's not stupid.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8395","Katie","I'm going to see Kyle.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8396","Robin","Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once. You should only be having s*x with someone who's special.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8397","Katie","Oh, please, you've had s*x with, like, a hundred guys.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8398","Robin","It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8399","Katie","I'm sure you were madly in love with all of them.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8400","Robin","I had different levels of feeling for each of the... very reasonable number of guys.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8401","Katie","Really. Well, do you love Ted? Do you love Ted?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8402","Robin","I, um...","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8403","Ted","Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 22  The Empire State Building has tons of places where people can have private conversations. ( goes away with Robin) You're off the hook, okay?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8404","Robin","Just let me explain.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8405","Ted","You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8406","Robin","Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying... ""hm hm hm"" is like... getting into the carpool lane. And I don't want to take an exit, but... at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane. Because what's in the carpool lane? Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get...","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8407","Ted","Okay, Robin, Robin, stop. It's no big deal, you don't have to say it.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8408","Robin","It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8409","Ted","What, you mean like I did?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8410","Robin","No. I didn't... Yeah, like you did. I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8411","Ted","Weird... or courageous?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8412","Robin","Pretty sure weird. I mean, who gives it up on the first date?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8413","Ted","Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8414","Robin","No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8415","Ted","Well, then you're an I-love-you prude. You know what? I take mine back.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8416","Robin","You... What?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8417","Ted","I take my ""I love you"" back.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8418","Robin","You can't take it back.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8419","Ted","Nah. Just did. Got it right here. But, you know, I'm such a slut. I'm just gonna give it away. Hey, you, sir. I love you.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8420","Man","Thank you, man. I was going up there to jump. (the man hugs Ted)","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8421","Lily","Marshall, why is this such a big deal?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8422","Marshall","Why is this such a big deal? Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus, guess who actually discovered the New World. Some dude named Scooter. Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong, it actually goes like this  ""One small step for man, one giant leap for Scooter."" Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve before you did...","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8423","Lily","Okay, Marshall, I get it.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8424","Marshall","It's a big deal because it rewrites our history.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8425","Lily","No, it doesn't. Look, have you been to the Empire State Building? No. You've only been in the lobby. People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby. They buy tickets to get to the top. Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8426","Marshall","Really. Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8427","Marshall","Thank you, sir. You're a very wise and brilliant man.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8428","Man","You're right. Why would I throw that all away? I'm having the best day!","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8429","Robin","Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place to lecture you on romantic relationships, but... but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8430","Katie","Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8431","Robin","That's not what I meant. I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up. Please don't do this.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8432","Ted (V.O.) ","But, kids, later that night, Katie did it, and she got pregnant... with quintuplets... and she lived out her days in a trailer park... where she died an alcoholic. So the moral here, kids, don't have s*x until you're married. Maybe even, like, a year or two into marriage.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8433","His kids","Dad!","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8434","The girl","Come on, what really happened?","02","12","First Time in New York"

"8442","Katie","Hey. Got another Empire State Building fun fact for me?","02","12","First Time in New York"

"8444","Katie","I don't know what everyone is freaking out about. Kyle, he's a really nice guy. He could've cheated on me with my lab partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't. 'Cause he said he knew I'd find out.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8445","Ted","That's very gallant. Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either. - I was your age my first time.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8446","Katie","Oh, really?","02","12","First Time in New York"

"8452","Molly","Where are you going?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8453","Ted","My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome.","02","12","First Time in New York"

"8457","Ted","Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.(Voix off) But I didn't.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8458","Ted","And I never saw her again. I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have s*x. I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and... that's exactly what I did. Look, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like. Even the nice ones.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8459","Katie","So I told Kyle I wanted to wait... and he dumped me.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8460","Robin","Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Aw, honey. I promise everything is gonna be okay. You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8461","Katie","Only if you put a buttload of Kahlua in it.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8462","Robin","Don't tell Mom.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8463","Robin","Thanks for doing that.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8464","Ted","You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8465","Robin","But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8466","Ted","Yeah, well...","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8467","Ted","I love you, Molly.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8468","Molly","Oh, I love you, too, Ted.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8469","Ted","Wow. That was amazing.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8470","Molly","Look, I got to go.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8471","Ted","Wh-Where are you going?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8472","Molly","Uh, my cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going into the woods to light them. It's gonna be awesome.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8473","Ted","Will you call me?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8474","Molly","Yeah. I'll totally call you. Oh, Ted?","02","12","First Time in New York"

"8480","Robin","Yeah. I guess I was just waiting for the right guy.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8481","Ted (voix off)","Katie ended up having a great first time in New York. And the last thing we did before she left was go to the Empire State Building.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8482","Ted","I am so glad we're finally doing this.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8483","Barney","What are you talking about? We were here yesterday.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8484","Marshall","Yeah, but that didn't really count. Oh, crap.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8485","Lily","Exactly! So yesterday doesn't count as having gone to the Empire State Building. So I lost it to you, Marshall. And I rode that elevator to the top, and I saw that view, and I basked in the awesomeness. And that's our story.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8486","Marshall","Yeah. Yeah, that's our story. We've only had s*x with each other.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8487","Lily","We've only had s*x with each other.","02","12","First Time in New York"

"8490","Ted","So, now you guys can finally say you've been to the Empire State Building. How have you lived here so long and never been to the top?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8491","Marshall","Well, we're usually busy... drinking.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8492","Lily","Speaking of first times, we never got to hear your virginity story.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8493","Marshall","That's right, I almost forgot.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8494","Barney","Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout...","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8495","Marshall","Fast Times at Ridgemont High.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8496","Barney","I mean, I was in a subway with a high-priced call girl...","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8497","Ted","Risky Business.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8498","Barney","I was accidentally hacking into NORAD'S computer...","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8499","Ted","That's War Games, and there's not even a s*x scene in it.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8500","Barney","All right! I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda. She called me ""Barry"" the whole time, and for two weeks, my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8501","Marshall","Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8502","Barney","Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's. Her dad did not approve of our love.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8503","Ted","Did anyone put Baby in a corner?","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8504","Barney","Oh, God, no. What can I say, I... had... the time of my life. True story.","02","12","First Time in New York"
"8505","Ted (voix off)","Some kids dream of being astronauts. Some kids dream of playing baseball. When I was a kid, I had only one dream. To build a skyscraper.","02","13","Columns"
"8506","Boy","That's stupid. (he destroys Ted's tower.)","02","13","Columns"
"8507","Ted (voix off)","There were some obstacles along the way. But eventually my dream came true. I became an architect.","02","13","Columns"
"8508","Ted","Morning, everyone! So, I had an idea for the atrium. Ready? Columns.","02","13","Columns"
"8509","Mr. Druthers","That's stupid. (he destroys his model)","02","13","Columns"
"8510","Ted","I... I can't believe you knocked over my model.","02","13","Columns"
"8511","Mr Druthers","Well, it's just... it's not exactly new, is it-- columns? I mean, what's your next groundbreaking idea-- ceilings? Floors? Windows?","02","13","Columns"
"8512","Ted (voix off)","I know what you're thinking  Who's this jerk? Well, this jerk was Hammond Druthers, a legend in the architecture community. Very big in the '80s. He was also far and away the worst boss I ever had. Then I designed the Spokane National Bank Building. And suddenly... I was his boss. - And he didn't like it.","02","13","Columns"
"8513","Mr Druthers","Stairs?","02","13","Columns"
"8514","Ted (voix off)","And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either. See, before, when I was just another employee, I was happy, carefree. The guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss.","02","13","Columns"
"8515","Ted","Did you see what he was wearing today? It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples.","02","13","Columns"
"8516","Co-worker","Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers, I get hay fever just looking at it.","02","13","Columns"
"8517","Ted (voix off)","But suddenly I was a different guy.","02","13","Columns"
"8518","Ted","Hey, guys. What's so funny?","02","13","Columns"
"8519","Co-worker","Nothing. Um... nice shirt.","02","13","Columns"
"8520","Ted","Thanks.","02","13","Columns"
"8521","Ted (voix off)","The hours were insane. I was always working even when I wasn't at work.","02","13","Columns"
"8522","Ted","Oh, Robin... I just had a great idea.","02","13","Columns"
"8523","Robin","Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up.","02","13","Columns"
"8524","Ted (voix off)","Before, I used to be this guy.","02","13","Columns"
"8525","Ted","Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert. Just say you're sick.","02","13","Columns"
"8526","Ted (voix off)","But now...I was this guy.","02","13","Columns"
"8527","Ted","Sick, huh? Unbutton your shirt. Hmm... ""Foo Fighters."" Get back to work.","02","13","Columns"
"8528","Ted (voix off)","But still, the worst part was Druthers.","02","13","Columns"
"8529","Ted","Well, I was thinking...","02","13","Columns"
"8530","Mr Druthers","Ceilings? Oops. Said that already. Then again, you seem to like rehashing old ideas. I'm kidding, of course. Another hole in one, boss.","02","13","Columns"
"8531","Robin","Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking.","02","13","Columns"
"8532","Ted","Why would you say that?","02","13","Columns"
"8533","Robin","Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that.","02","13","Columns"
"8534","Barney","I have found that to be true.","02","13","Columns"
"8535","Marshall","It's a blessing and a curse really.","02","13","Columns"
"8536","Lily","Ted, you can't let him treat you like that.","02","13","Columns"
"8537","Marshall","Yeah, you gotta ask yourself, who's the boss?","02","13","Columns"
"8538","Ted","Tony.","02","13","Columns"
"8539","Robin","Angela.","02","13","Columns"
"8540","Barney","Mona.","02","13","Columns"
"8541","Robin","Mona?","02","13","Columns"
"8542","Barney","Watch it more closely. Rock your world.","02","13","Columns"
"8543","Robin","So, what are you gonna do?","02","13","Columns"
"8544","Ted","Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss. So, I went to talk to the managing partner.","02","13","Columns"
"8545","MP","Fire him.","02","13","Columns"
"8546","Ted","Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project.","02","13","Columns"
"8547","MP","Fire him! He's an arrogant, washed-up, pain in the ass. In fact, fire everyone on that project. Druthers, Mosby, the whole lot of them.","02","13","Columns"
"8548","Ted","Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear Mosby's doing some great work.","02","13","Columns"
"8549","MP","Fine, Mosby can stay. But tell him he's on thin ice. Come here. I like you, Crosby.","02","13","Columns"
"8550","Barney","You mind if I charge my phone?","02","13","Columns"
"8551","Ted","Knock yourself out.","02","13","Columns"
"8552","Robin","Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing. Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?","02","13","Columns"
"8553","Robin","Vicki, um... I'm so sorry about this, but there's been some budget cuts and, um, we have to let you go. I mean, after tonight. I still need my makeup for the broadcast. So... (Robin on TV wearing a lot of make-up.)  Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims.","02","13","Columns"

"8559","Robin","What is that?","02","13","Columns"
"8560","Barney","Only the greatest thing ever. Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup. If they were to cure cancer tomorrow, this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week. Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall.","02","13","Columns"
"8561","Ted","Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared.","02","13","Columns"
"8562","Barney","I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time.","02","13","Columns"
"8563","Robin","Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it.","02","13","Columns"
"8564","Barney","Oh, come on, Robin.","02","13","Columns"
"8565","Robin","No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun.","02","13","Columns"

"8569","Mr Druthers","Well, excuse me, for spending the last four hours drawing designs for your building.","02","13","Columns"
"8570","Ted","This is a cocktail napkin. Covered in profanity. Look, Hammond, um, there's no easy way to say this, so... why don't we just, um, step into your office.","02","13","Columns"
"8571","Employees","Happy birthday to you.","02","13","Columns"
"8572","Mr Druthers","Oh, you had me. You so had me.","02","13","Columns"
"8573","Robin","So, you didn't fire him?","02","13","Columns"
"8574","Ted","I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised.","02","13","Columns"
"8575","Barney","Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat. I know how much you love stools.","02","13","Columns"
"8576","Marshall","Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture.","02","13","Columns"

"8587","Lily","I knew this day would come.","02","13","Columns"
"8588","Marshall","How did you know that?","02","13","Columns"
"8589","Lily","Because I didn't hide it very well.","02","13","Columns"
"8590","Ted (voix off)","So the story on the painting is that,back in college, Lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class. Marshall wasn't so into the idea.","02","13","Columns"
"8591","Marshall","Well, I just... don't think that some dude should drop trou just to pose for you.","02","13","Columns"
"8592","Lily","It's for class, and it's just that weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.","02","13","Columns"

"8594","Lily","No, he's actually a little husky...","02","13","Columns"

"8656","Mr Druthers","If you were lost in the wilderness, she can provide for me.","02","13","Columns"
"8657","Ted","Well, that's the dream.","02","13","Columns"
"8658","Mr Druthers","I'm glad you came here tonight, Ted.","02","13","Columns"
"8659","Ted","Me too, Hammond.","02","13","Columns"
"8660","Mr Druthers","Call me Ham.","02","13","Columns"
"8661","Ted","No, thanks.","02","13","Columns"
"8662","Mr Druthers","Hammy D?","02","13","Columns"
"8663","Ted","No, I think just Hammond.","02","13","Columns"
"8664","Robin","So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him.","02","13","Columns"
"8665","Ted","I was this close.","02","13","Columns"
"8666","Ted (voix off)","Meanwhile, Lily had been up all night in the grips of a dilemma.","02","13","Columns"
"8667","Lily","Oh honey, you're awake?","02","13","Columns"
"8668","Marshall","I'm awake. Is everything okay?","02","13","Columns"
"8669","Lily","Yeah. I've kind of been wrestling with something. What if I told you I had a way to pay for our honeymoon?","02","13","Columns"
"8670","Marshall","Baby, our honeymoon's already paid for. We're going to Howe Caverns.","02","13","Columns"
"8671","Lily","Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?","02","13","Columns"
"8672","Marshall","It's not just a cave, it's a whole labyrinth of caves. It's an underground adventure. There's a cave that's so dark that you don't even know you're in there. I mean, we're going to experience a whole new kind of dark.","02","13","Columns"
"8673","Lily","Well, what if I found a way to make a little extra money so that we spend our honeymoon not in Howe Caverns, but in Scotland?","02","13","Columns"
"8674","Marshall","Loch Ness?","02","13","Columns"
"8675","Lily","Yeah. And you know, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Glasgow...","02","13","Columns"
"8676","Marshall","Loch Ness. Nessy. Baby, I would love to search for the enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch, but... we can't afford that.","02","13","Columns"
"8677","Lily","Maybe we can.","02","13","Columns"
"8678","Barney","Paint me.","02","13","Columns"
"8679","Lily","Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you?","02","13","Columns"
"8680","Barney","We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame. I do not. In my body, where the shame gland should be, there's a second awesome gland. True story.","02","13","Columns"
"8681","Lily","Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting.","02","13","Columns"
"8682","Barney","Yeah. A nude Barney is a challenge. But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this. Now is the time-- I'm 31. I'm at the peak of my physical beauty. If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago. Long ago.","02","13","Columns"
"8683","Lily","Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked.","02","13","Columns"
"8684","Barney","I'll give you $5,000.","02","13","Columns"
"8685","Marshall","We're going to Loch Ness!","02","13","Columns"
"8686","Lily","Yeah!","02","13","Columns"
"8687","Ted","That cabby would not shut up.","02","13","Columns"
"8688","Mr Druthers","Yeah, we should call him a gabby.","02","13","Columns"
"8689","Ted","I think it, you say it.","02","13","Columns"
"8690","Mr Druthers","Hey, uh... thanks for putting me up last night, buddy. Give 'em hell.","02","13","Columns"
"8691","Ted","Morning, team. So, I have given it some thought, and I say we revisit columns.","02","13","Columns"
"8692","Mr Druthers","Oh, God, not this again. Ted, a man in a toga just arrived and delivered a parchment. Let me read it  Oh! It's from ancient Greece. They want their basic architectural elements back. Geez.","02","13","Columns"
"8693","Ted","What?","02","13","Columns"
"8694","Mr Druthers","You didn't hear me? Toga, parchment...","02","13","Columns"
"8695","Ted","Can I see you for one second?","02","13","Columns"
"8696","Mr Druthers","Ooh, I'm in trouble now.","02","13","Columns"
"8697","Ted","What are you doing? I thought we were friends. You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal. I tossed you more toilet paper.","02","13","Columns"
"8698","Mr Druthers","We are friends. But that doesn't magically make your bad ideas good.","02","13","Columns"
"8699","Ted","What? I don't believe this! You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes! And my","02","13","Columns"
"8700","Mr Druthers","Ted, I hope that you're not going to let our professional woes interfere with our friendship, because I really kind of need you right now.","02","13","Columns"
"8701","Lily","Okay, let's get this over with.","02","13","Columns"
"8702","Barney","Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in. This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art. I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift.","02","13","Columns"
"8703","Lily","Thank you.","02","13","Columns"
"8704","Barney","I meant me. Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence. Goofy and unburdened, with wit. But me, I want something more regal. Something my progeny could look at and say, ""There's stands Barnabus Stinson."" He was wise... and strong.","02","13","Columns"
"8705","Lily","I don't think your sword will fit.","02","13","Columns"
"8706","Barney","I get that a lot.","02","13","Columns"
"8707","Ted (voix off)","And so, as Lily began painting, Marshall thought about the $5,000 and what his fiancee was doing to earn it.","02","13","Columns"
"8708","Marshall","This isn't right. This isn't right at all.","02","13","Columns"
"8709","Ted (voix off)","Finally, he could take it no more.","02","13","Columns"
"8710","Lily","Hold still. Hold still. Hold still!","02","13","Columns"
"8711","Barney","Paint faster!","02","13","Columns"
"8712","Lily","Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts.","02","13","Columns"
"8713","Barney","Yeah. Wait, wait! That wasn't enough buildup. I need... In a world without justice, one man...","02","13","Columns"
"8714","Lily","Oh, just drop them!","02","13","Columns"
"8715","Barney","All right.","02","13","Columns"
"8716","Marshall","No! No, this is not right!","02","13","Columns"
"8717","Barney","We had a deal!","02","13","Columns"
"8718","Marshall","Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out!","02","13","Columns"
"8719","Barney","You...!","02","13","Columns"
"8720","Marshall","It's over! (he closes the door at Barney's face). (Yelling) Lily, I can't let you go through with this! (whispering) I found a castle we can stay in, but it's an extra two grand. (Yelling) It's just not right! (whispering). It's beautiful and they say it's haunted.","02","13","Columns"
"8721","Barney","Before you say anything, I'll give you an extra five grand.","02","13","Columns"
"8722","Marshall","We accept.","02","13","Columns"
"8723","Barney","You people are so easy to control. Dance for me, puppets, dance.","02","13","Columns"
"8724","Ted (voix off)","And that's how Uncle Barney paid for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.","02","13","Columns"
"8725","Mr Druthers","Come on, Ted, listen, why don't we get back and finish drawing the plans for a building which, in my opinion, is never going to get built, so you and I can get out of here and grab a couple of beers.","02","13","Columns"
"8726","Ted","No. Look, Hammond, there's no easy way to say this but...","02","13","Columns"
"8727","Man","Looking for Hammond Druthers.","02","13","Columns"
"8728","Mr Druthers","Oh, that's me. I'm Hammond Druthers.","02","13","Columns"
"8729","Man","These are divorce papers. You've been served.","02","13","Columns"

"8731","Mr Druthers","She's really going through with this. So that's it. It's over.","02","13","Columns"
"8732","Ted","There is no easy way to say this, but...","02","13","Columns"
"8733","Mr Druthers","She's giving me the remains of Wolfie? My dog is dead? Oh, my God. I can't believe this. She always played too rough with him.","02","13","Columns"

"8738","Ted","Wait, his birthday was yesterday!","02","13","Columns"
"8739","Man","Yeah, but a bunch of us were up at the conference in Montreal, so we thought...","02","13","Columns"
"8740","Ted","No! No birthday! No! I got something to say and I'm gonna get it out. Hammond, listen to me. I am sorry that your dog died, and that your wife is divorcing you and that... your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday. And there is no easy way to say... What are you doing? What's going on?","02","13","Columns"
"8741","Mr Druthers","Oh, God...","02","13","Columns"
"8742","Ted","Oh, come on, you're not going to pull that, are you? Oh! Look, yeah, right. Now we're falling onto the ground. Well, nice try, but guess what? You're fired! You're fired, you get it? You hear me? You're gone! You're fired! (Mr Druthers is taken on a stretcher with an oxygen mask on his face.) In my defense, I think we all suspected Hammond might have been faking. On the plus side, the EMTs seem to think he's going to be just fine and, as you saw, they did admit that I did not cause the heart attack, even if they said it a bit begrudgingly.","02","13","Columns"
"8743","Ted (voix off)","And there it was, rock bottom  They all hated me. But just when all seemed lost, I had the greatest idea of my entire career.","02","13","Columns"
"8744","Man","Margarita Fridays--great idea, boss.","02","13","Columns"
"8745","Lily","Okay, it's done. I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it.","02","13","Columns"
"8746","Barney","Thank you very much, Lily.","02","13","Columns"
"8747","Lily","Marshall, do you have the money?","02","13","Columns"

"8749","Lily","Let's get out of here!","02","13","Columns"
"8750","Barney","A smooth area?! You gave me the Ken doll?! Marshall and Lily get out of the apartment. She left out Little Barney. Barnacle Junior. My Barnana is... Barnito Supreme.","02","13","Columns"
"8751","Ted (voix off)","Kids, I told you stories about all the big holidays - Christmas... Halloween... Thanksgiving... but one holiday was always my favorite-- Super Bowl Sunday. And there was one Super Bowl back in 2007 that I will never forget.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8752","Ted","Marshall, you're on beer detail. Lily, you're making the bean dip. Uh, Robin, you're on chips and pretzels, and Barney, I'm giving you nothing to do so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8753","Barney","""Problem."" Oh, poor Superman, he should really do something about his flying problem. It's not a problem if you're awesome at it.","02","14","Monday Night Football"

"8763","Ted","Who was Mark?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8764","Marshall","No idea.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8765","Barney","Not a clue.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8766","Lily","Well, I guess we should go, right?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8767","Marshall","Wait... tomorrow night at 6 00, that's the Super Bowl.","02","14","Monday Night Football"

"8770","Ted","Mark, and as long as we send flowers, I can't think of any reason we'd have to Carl (at the bar)  Get out of here! I never want to see your face in this bar again! This soulless b*st*rd just told me he can't come to Mark's funeral because he wants to watch the Super Bowl. Could you believe that? You guys are coming, right?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8771","All","Yes... Wouldn't miss for the world.","02","14","Monday Night Football"

"8774","Ted","Mark, and start watching only an hour late.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8775","Marshall","Okay, that's great, but just to make sure it records, maybe we should bow our heads and say a quiet prayer to the TiVo gods.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8776","Ted","Almighty TiVo, we thank you for all the gifts you have given us  the power to freeze live TV to go take a leak is nothing short of Godlike. Let's not forget fast-forwarding through commercials. It seems greedy to ask anything more from you, O magic box, but if you malfunction and miss the Super Bowl, we will destroy you in the","02","14","Monday Night Football"

"8778","Ted","Amen.","02","14","Monday Night Football"

"8780","Robin","Yeah, they're the best part.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8781","Ted","Oh, come on. Remember last year? Who wants to watch a monkey in a coconut bra order a pizza?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8782","Robin","Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8783","Barney","Seriously, that's the last time I'm gonna call you today. Okay. Good-bye. You didn't hang up either! I know! You hang up! You hang up! My bookie. Great guy.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8784","Ted","So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8785","Barney","Have I taught you nothing, Ted?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8786","Ted","Virtually.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8787","Barney","Suits are full of joy. They're the sartorial equivalent of a baby's smile.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8788","Ted","Sartorial""?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8789","Barney","""Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade."" Suits are for the living. That's why when it's my time to R.I.P. I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it buck naked. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies. What up?!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8790","Barney","Such a waste.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8791","Lily","I know. He was so young.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8792","Barney","A hand-stitched, cashmere, double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana. It must be so frightened.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8793","Robin","This is going faster than I thought. We'll make an appearance at the bar for the wake, we'll be watching the game by 8 00.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8794","Carl","And even though we didn't see any whales, Mark and I both said it was the best day of our lives. Okay, I'm getting us another round. And when I come back, everyone else is telling their favorite Mark story.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8795","Marshall","Dibs on the one Carl just told.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8796","Robin","Okay, I have to be at work exactly one Super Bowl from now.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8797","Lily","Oh, let's face it, we're not going to get to watch it. We should just find out the score.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8798","Barney","Oh, thank God! I'll find out.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8799","Ted","No, no, no, we can't! We have to watch the game together. It's tradition. Think of all the great times we've had watching this game.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8800","Ted","Second down, everyone drink.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8801","Barney","Ted, it's not a drinking game if you drink anytime anything happens.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8802","Marshall","Are these chicken wings or angel wings? God, I love these things.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8803","Ted","I love you guys. This is so great, all of us watching the Super Bowl together. This is special. We need to do this every year, promise me!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8804","Marshall","Calm down, buddy.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8805","Lily","Oh, commercials!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8806","Ted","Everyone drink!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8807","Ted","God, this is such a great tradition, all of us watching the game together. How did this start?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8808","Marshall","Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks that Casey misses this field goal.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8809","Barney","I don't bet. Betting's for suckers.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8810","Marshall","Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8811","Barney","Fine.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8812","Marshall","See, there you go, he made it. You win.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8813","Barney","Wait. This is mine, just like that? God, that feels good. No, that feels really... good. What else can we bet on?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8814","Marshall","Nothing, it's the halftime show.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8815","Lily","Oh, so lame. Nobody even pays attention. I mean, Janet Jackson, who cares?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8816","Ted","God, how cool is Robin?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8817","Marshall","I can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months to our sacred day. Now she's gonna be in all the pictures.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8818","Barney","Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks plus six points for 500 bucks.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8819","Marshall","Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8820","Barney","$50?! What fun is $50?! Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall! Okay, $50.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8821","Robin","Hey, I'll take that action. Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand. Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings? Oh, commercials! Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8822","Ted","Look, we always watch the Super Bowl together. So we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 6 00 and go the next 18 hours without finding out who won.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8823","Barney","That's impossible.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8824","Ted","I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy. That means no TV, no Internet, no newspapers, nothing. Media blackout. But our tradition lives on. Who's in?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8825","Lily","I'm in.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8826","Robin","I'm in.","02","14","Monday Night Football"

"8828","Barney","What the hell, I'm in. High five!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8829","Ted","Dude, we're at a wake.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8830","Barney","Sorry. Solemn low five.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8831","Ted (voix off)","As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8832","Barney","Hey, take this key and swallow it.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8833","Ted","What? No.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8834","Barney","Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8835","Ted","Lots more, no.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8836","Barney","I'm not messing around, Theodore. I've got a lot of money riding on this game. If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator, I'll check the score. Please take the key.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8837","Ted","Fine. But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan and I think that's funny.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8838","Ted (voix off)","The media blackout was particularly hard on Robin because, well, she was the media.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8839","Robin","But unfortunately, the City won't be fixing the unusually large pothole any time soon, so buckle up if you're on the BQE. It's gonna be a bumpy one.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8840","Kevin","Like morning commutes needed to get any harder.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8841","Man","You're right, Kevin.","02","14","Monday Night Football"

"8844","Kevin","What?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8845","Robin","No.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8846","Kevin","But it's, uh, time for Sports.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8847","Robin","No, it's not. It's time for Weather.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8848","Kevin","We, we just did Weather.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8849","Robin","Well, weather's pretty fickle, it may have changed. What's it doing out there, Lou?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8850","Lou","Pretty much the same thing it was two minutes ago. Back to you, Robin.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8851","Kevin","Okay, now it's time for Sports.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8852","Robin","No! Let's go to Traffic Todd in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8853","Kevin","Robin, it's time for Sports! Over to you, Sid.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8854","Sid","Thank you, Kevin and Robin. Let's talk about the Super Bowl.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8855","Ted (voix off)","Weeks earlier, Marshall had promised Lily he'd come into her kindergarten class for show-and-tell day.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8856","Lily","And he's a little bit double-jointed... And his favorite animal is the Loch Ness monster.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8857","Marshall","Lily, how many times...? Nessie is a gentle creature. We're trying to stay away from terms like ""Monster.""","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8858","Lily","Well, I think we can all agree, he is much more interesting than Sally's one-eyed goldfish. Three weeks in a row? Come on, Sally. Okay, well, that's all the time we have. Arts and crafts, everybody.","02","14","Monday Night Football"

"8862","Marshall","Yeah, I'm actually trying to hide out 'cause I don't want to know who won the Super Bowl.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8863","Doug","I know who won.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8864","Marshall","Oh, um, that's great, but I really don't want to know, so if you could just keep that to yourself.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8865","Doug","How badly do you not want to know?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8866","Marshall","Excuse me?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8867","Doug","Ten bucks.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8868","Marshall","Are you serious?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8869","Doug","Just went up to eight.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8870","Barney","Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8871","Ted","Not until game time.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8872","Barney","Where are you going?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8873","Ted","Pick up the hot wings.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8874","Barney","What? How the hell are you planning on getting in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score? There's TVs everywhere.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8875","Ted","Ah, don't worry. I got it all planned out. First of all  I placed duct tape on a pair of sunglasses so I can only see out of two tiny holes. Next, I constructed blinders out of an old cereal box. Top it all off  high-tech noise-reducing headphones I bought when Marshall and Lily first got back together and were doing it a lot. I call it the Sensory Deprivator 5000.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8876","Ted","Hello! Uh, my name is Ted Mosby. I'm here to pick up my hot wings. In my hand, you'll find the exact total for the wings plus a generous tip. Please take the cash. Put the wings in my hand and I'll be on my way. Thank you!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8877","Sid","And that closes the book on one heck of a Super Bowl. Back to you, Kevin and Robin.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8878","Kevin","We'll be right back.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8879","Man","And we're clear.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8880","Robin","I'm sorry.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8881","Woman","Um, Robin, is it just me, or were you doing something different there?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8882","Robin","I haven't watched the game yet. I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl. I mean, change the teleprompter. No team names, nothing specific.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8883","Woman","That is crazy. I can't do that.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8884","Robin","My friend Mark passed away this week.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8885","Woman","Okay, sweety okay. Okay, I'm so sorry.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8886","Man","Back in five... four... three...","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8887","Robin","It's just so hard.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8888","Ted","Ha! Who's the idiot now?! You said the Sensory Deprivator 5000 was stupid. But it totally worked! (barney leaves and Ted doesn't notice.) I couldn't see or hear anything happening around me. Right?! Right?! (He takes his glasses off) No...!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8889","Ted (voix off)","And if that weren't bad enough, I was about to have a horrible realization.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8890","Ted","Where's the dipping sauce?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8891","Doug","The team that won, want to know what their name rhymes with?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8892","Marshall","Come on, dude. You promised you'd stop if I ate all those crayons. Why are you doing this?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8893","Doug","I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8894","Marshall","Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin, she's mine.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8895","Lily","Okay, now who did this?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8896","Marshall","I did.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8897","Doug","Does that mean Marshall gets a time-out?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8898","Lily","Well, Marshall's a grownup, so...","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8899","Doug","When one of us breaks something, we get a time-out.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8900","Lily","Sorry. Marshall gets a time-out.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8901","Robin","And after the Super Bowl, the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up, sending the mayor of the winning team's city 15 pounds of a delicacy his of her city is famous for. Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8902","Doug","Hey. Hey.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8903","Marshall","I'm not talking to you.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8904","Doug","Yes, you are. You'll do whatever I say. Hold your breath.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8905","Marshall","I'm not holding my breath.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8906","Doug","The winning team was the... (Marshall holds his breath) Now here's how this is going to work  you're going to take me to three R-rated movies a week...","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8907","Ted (voix off)","And then Uncle Marshall got an idea. It was not one he was proud of in retrospect, but desperate times...","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8908","Marshall","Oh, no. Somebody wet their pants.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8909","Doug","No, I didn't.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8910","Marshall","Oh, really? Who's everyone gonna believe? I'm a grownup third-year law student at Columbia and you're just a little pants wetter. So now I ask you a question  You want to be able to quietly sneak off to the restroom and dry off or am I gonna have something for show and tell today? Hey, everyone...","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8911","Doug","Okay, okay. You win.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8912","Marshall","I want my money back. And your pudding snack pack.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8913","Barney","Sir, who won the Super Bowl?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8914","Man","Sorry. I missed the game.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8915","Barney","You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8916","Man 2","I... don't really follow sports.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8917","Barney","Oh, my...! Emmitt Smith! Oh, thank God.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8918","Emmitt Smith","Yeah, I get that a lot.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8919","Barney","You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8920","Emmitt Smith","The game was last night? You know, once you win two or three of those things, it's kind of like, eh.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8921","Barney","But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8922","Emmitt Smith","Dance, my friend. Dance.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8923","Barney","No...!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8924","Ted","Hello! It's me again.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8925","Barman","Oh! I didn't recognize you.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8926","Ted","Yeah, you forgot to give me the dipping sauce! Ah. Yes. This is the one.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8927","Ted (voix off)","It was 4 00, and so far, all of us had done the impossible. But then, almost simultaneously, things started to go wrong.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8928","Robin","And let's end the day on a happy note. There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo. Trish Sanchez has the story.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8929","Man 1","Hey, buddy.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8930","Man 2","Hey, dude, look out.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8931","Trish Sanchez","And in honor of yesterday's big win...","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8932","Man 1","Hey, buddy, look out.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8933","Man 2","Dude, watch out!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8934","Trish Sanchez","...the zoo decided to name the baby panda after Super Bowl champions...","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8935","Robin","No...!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8936","Marshall (at school)","No...!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8937","Barney (tearing the newspaper)","No...!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8938","Ted","Yes...!","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8939","Ted","Awesome. Just in time for kick-off. None of you guys found out the score, right?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8940","Robin","Mission accomplished.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8941","Lily","Didn't find out.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8942","Ted","Great. Let's do it. I already fast-forwarded through the four hours of pre-game coverage. So we are ready. (Barney comes in) Barney, I can't even look at you. I don't want any sign of who won.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8943","Ted","Don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away. Feel free to start without me. Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! So much money! You screwed it up, Barney! You screwed everything up! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Okay, let's watch the game.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8944","Ted","Barney, what the hell was that? We know who you bet on. Now you've ruined the game for everyone.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8945","Lily","Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8946","Robin","Way to blow it.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8947","Marshall","Yeah, I didn't know and now I do know.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8948","Ted","There's no point in even watching the game.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8949","Lily","Well, at least the commercials aren't ruined.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8950","Marshall","Wings are still good.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8951","Robin","Beer still works.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8952","Ted","Ah, what the hell. Let's watch Barney lose some money.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8953","Marshall","Hey, so check this out  I got extorted by a five-year-old today.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8954","Robin","I almost got fired today.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8955","Barney","I met Emmitt Smith today.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8956","Lily","Ooh, you go first.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8957","Ted","I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8958","Lily","Yeah, go ahead, Barney.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8959","Barney","Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game...","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8960","Ted (voix off)","And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8961","Barney","I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss?","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8962","Ted","50-50, give or take.","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8963","Barney","Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks, whether or not there'd be a safety, first...","02","14","Monday Night Football"
"8964","Ted (voix off)","Kids, never underestimate the power of destiny. Because when you least expect it, the littlest thing can cause a ripple effect that changes your life. Take for instance my trip to Chicago.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8965","Robin","That security guard was a little bit handsy.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8966","Ted","That's funny. She barely touched me. Uh, Gate 23. Come on. If we miss this flight, I will never forgive myself.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8967","Ted (voix off)","Why was this flight so important? Let's back up a few months to the fall of 2006. I had just sold my first building design and become the youngest project manager in my firm's history. Suddenly I was being headhunted. One firm was even considering me to run their entire New York office. They were flying me in for a final interview at their corporate headquarters in Chicago. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. It was my destiny. There was just one problem.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8968","Ted","Hi, wait, two more.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8969","Woman","Sorry, you're too late, I already shut the doors.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8970","Ted","Well, I'm sure if we pull real hard we can open them.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8971","Woman","Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but see, once I close those doors, that's it. Nobody else is allowed down that jet-way. Except for that guy.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8972","Ted","Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss the chance to interview for my dream job.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8973","Woman","I'm sorry, sir.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8974","Robin","His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job? Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do? I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night dreaming about being a... I mean, uh... This is a cool job.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8975","Ted","Please, I have to be on this flight.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8976","Woman","I'll see what I can do. But it doesn't look good.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8977","Ted","Thanks.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8978","Robin","Your uniforms are pretty.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8979","Woman","Okay. They haven't armed the doors yet, so you still have a chance. It's up to the captain now and they're calling us back.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8980","Ted","Great, please let us know as soon as you hear anything.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8981","Woman","Sure, and for the future, we recommend you arrive at the airport an hour and a half before your flight, not, you know, one minute after.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8982","Ted","Normally, I'm incredibly responsible. I just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced. Not that I'm a criminal or anything.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8983","Rubin","Yeah, he just jumped a subway turnstile.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8984","Woman","You seem to have a lot of problems with the rules of travel. (The phone rings) Hello? Oh, that is great news. It's my mom-- she found her missing earring. Have a seat. I'll call you when I hear something. Where was it?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8985","Ted","That thing better have call waiting.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8986","Robin","Could you just call the firm and explain what happened?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8987","Ted","It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today. I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage. I'm so stupid. Why did I have to jump that turnstile?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8988","Robin","Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8989","Ted (voix off)","She had a point. It was kind of Barney's fault. Let's back up a few months.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8990","Robin","Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8991","Marshall","Oh, man, it kills.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8992","Lily","You want some aspirin, baby?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8993","Marshall","You know I don't believe in pain killers.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8994","Ted","Wow, your first broken bone. Kind of kills your whole ""Unbreakable"" theory.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8995","Lily","Marshall used to think he was indestructible.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8996","Marshall","Well, it added up. I've never broken anything. I've never been sick, and when I need to, I can summon incredible strength. Ted, tell her the story of the really heavy door.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8997","Ted","There was a really heavy door. He opened it.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8998","Marshall","On one pull.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"8999","Robin","Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9000","Marshall","Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9001","Barney","Training for a marathon.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9002","Marshall","What?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9003","Barney","You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9004","Marshall","You're kidding, right?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9005","Barney","Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9006","Marshall","So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9007","Barney","Absolutely.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9008","Robin","Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9009","Ted","Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9010","Barney","Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9011","Marshall","NA Marshall","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9012","Barney","50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it $10,000.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9013","Marshall","You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9014","Barney","Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9015","Ted (voix off)","The next morning, as the marathon began, we were focused on Marshall's computer.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9016","Marshall","Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online, see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9017","Robin","Ooh, he's starting!","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9018","Marshall","This ought to be good. Wow. (48 minutes later) He's already passing the second checkpoint.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9019","Lily","This tracking thing is amazing. When we get married, you're getting one of these.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9020","Robin","Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9021","Marshall","He's gotta be cheating, okay. He knew we'd check.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9022","Ted","Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet. Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang ""Hungry Like the Wolf,"" and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9023","Marshall","Well, it looks like, ""Barney"" should be coming over the Queensboro Bridge and up First Avenue within the next hour or so. But... there is no way that that's really him.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9024","Marshall","It's really him.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9025","Lily","Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run!","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9026","Barney","What up, non-finishers?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9027","Ted","Wow. Very impressive, Barney.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9028","Barney","Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9029","Lily","I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9030","Barney","So where's my 50 bucks?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9031","Marshall","All right. I got to admit, you earned this.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9032","Barney","Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9033","Marshall","Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9034","Barney","Wow. You know I really should check out this ""subway."" Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9035","Ted","You're dating a girl from New Jersey?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9036","Barney","No.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9037","Ted (voix off)","So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon. But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9038","Ted","Hello?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9039","Barney","Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9040","Ted","What, what are you talking about?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9041","Barney","I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9042","Barney","Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9043","Voice","86th street.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9044","Barney","My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9045","Ted","(to Marshall) Barney's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9046","Marshall","Best 50 bucks I ever spent.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9047","Barney","Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9048","Ted","All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9049","Barney","Ted, Ted.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9050","Woman","Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9051","Barney","I'm sorry. I can't.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9052","Old lady","Douche.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9053","Ted","Barney?!","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9054","Barney","Ted!","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9055","Policeman","Hey!","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9056","Barney","No...!","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9057","Robin","See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9058","Ted","You're right. Everything can be traced back to him. Like that rash we all got at Christmas. I have to see what's going on.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9059","Woman","So I was able to get you two seats.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9060","Ted","Really? That's great!","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9061","Woman","No, no, not you. I'm talking to my mom about Blue Man Group. Ma, can I call you back?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9062","Ted","Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9063","Woman","I'm still waiting for... Huh. Looks like your flight left already.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9064","Ted","What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9065","Robin","Well, he never even called you back?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9066","Woman","Well, it's typical pilot.They don't call you back at work and they don't call you back after you spend two nights with them at a Radisson in Orlando.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9067","Ted (voix off)","It turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me to Chicago on time for my job interview, but it was all the way on the other side of the airport.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9068","Robin","What was the name of the airline again?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9069","Ted","I think it was something like Flights R' Us.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9070","Robin","Was the ""R"" backwards?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9071","Ted","God, I hope not.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9072","Robin","Geez.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9073","Ted","Stupid smart carts. More like dumb carts.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9074","Robin","If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9075","Ted","You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9076","Robin","Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9077","Ted (voix off)","For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9078","Marshall","My pants are starting to feel a little tight.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9079","Lily","Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9080","Marshall","I cannot allow this.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9081","Lily","What?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9082","Marshall","I am going to run the New York City Marathon.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9083","Lily","""It is important to load up on carbohydrates two to four hours before a big run. Try a breakfast of a bagel, a banana, oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice."" Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9084","Marshall","Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style. Liquids are digested faster. That way, no energy is wasted, and it's all about the run.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9085","Lily","""Don't forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement.""","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9086","Marshall","This is gonna be your best run yet. You're going to accomplish all of your goals. You are a robot sent from the future to win the marathon! You are... Marshall. You are... Marshall. You are Marshall! Yeah!","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9087","Lily","""Chafing or blisters can occur in a number of areas, including the feet, armpits, or even the nipples. Try using some petroleum jelly on the affected areas.""","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9088","Marshall","Oh, gosh! Dude, you are a terrific runner. Tomorrow you're gonna run and finish the New York City Marathon! You're the best. You look good. Nobody does it better than you.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9089","Robin","Marshall? Oh, my God!","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9090","Ted","So, yes, it was your fault. I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time! (Ted fells) And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9091","Robin","That really wasn't my fault. I wouldn't have walked in on","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9092","Robin","Hey, what's going on here?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9093","Ted","Oh, looks like they're camping out for something.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9094","Robin","Yeah, but for what?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9095","Ted","I don't know. Usually there's a Stormtrooper or Klingon in line to give you some indication. ""Annual wedding dress blowout. Designer sample dresses up to 90% off. Doors open tomorrow, 8 00 a.m.""","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9096","Robin","Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9097","Lily","We have to camp out.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9098","Robin","Are you serious?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9099","Lily","You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9100","Barney","I can't go. I've got this thing.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9101","Lily","What thing?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9102","Barney","A pen1s.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9103","Robin","This is the place.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9104","Lily","Oh, wow. Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet! Vera Wang! Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9105","Robin","You said wang.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9106","Lily","Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998. Only fewer mullets.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9107","Robin","You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9108","Lily","Ooh, this is comfy. We might actually be able to sleep.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9109","Robin","That's kind of annoying.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9110","Lily","Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute. (5 hours later) I don't think I can take this. Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again, but then it does. Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9111","Robin","It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9112","Lily","If we get through this, I swear I'm gonna live my life differently.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9113","Robin","I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9114","Man","Morning, ladies.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9115","Lily","It's him. It's the car guy!","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9116","Robin","Get out of here!","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9117","Ted (voix off)","The next morning, Robin was too tired to go all the way back to Brooklyn, so while I was at work, she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours, and that's when...","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9118","Marshall","Nobody does it better than you.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9119","Robin","Marshall?! Oh, my God! (Marshall falls)","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9120","Robin","So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store, we would have made the first flight.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9121","Ted","Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it. Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9122","Man","Oh, my God! You're that reporter from Metro News 1.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9123","Robin","Yes, yes, I am. I can't believe you recognized me.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9124","Man","You did that story on the giant pizzas?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9125","Ted","Would you check to see if you have any more seats?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9126","Man","One moment, sir. Were those pizzas real? Come on, were they?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9127","Ted","Robin...","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9128","Robin","One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9129","Man","I knew it!","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9130","Robin","God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9131","Man","Well, the, uh, flight attendants are just finishing up their final seat count. Let me see what I can find out.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9132","Ted","Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9133","Man","I think it might hurt. This is such a nightmare.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9134","Robin","Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out for a wedding dress?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9135","Ted","No. Wait. It goes back further. Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9136","Ted","1939?! This penny's from 1939! (at the bar with Robin) A 67-year-old penny. Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9137","Robin","Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9138","Ted","Look, I know a little something about coins, and this baby is worth something to a collector.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9139","Robin","No, it's not.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9140","Ted","Yes, it is! You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner with the money I get for this little guy.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9141","Ted( voix off)","And that's exactly what I did.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9142","Robin","You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9143","Ted","Hey, that's 150 times its original value. Actually, the meal was only $1.49. 1984.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9144","Robin","Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9145","Ted","How dare you.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9146","Robin","Hey, what's going on?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9147","Ted","I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9148","Robin","Yeah, but for what?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9149","Ted","It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9150","Robin","And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there, and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9151","Ted","Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe. Barney wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date...","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9152","Robin","And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9153","Ted","I wish I did. Though that person's already been punished enough, losing a sweet penny like that.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9154","Man","Uh, sir?","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9155","Ted","Oh, please tell me you have some good news.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9156","Man","Uh, I'm afraid not. There are no extra seats on the plane. I'm sorry.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9157","Robin","All, right, well, thanks for trying.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9158","Ted","I can't believe this. That's it, it's over.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9159","Robin","Ted, come on. Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today. Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9160","Ted (voix off)","But that's not what happened. They didn't reschedule. They hired someone else. And as it turned out, three months later, that guy ended up having to relocate to Chicago. Kids, funny thing about destiny, I thought I was destined to get that job. But I was wrong. My destiny was to stay in New York. Because if I hadn't, I never would have met your mother.","02","15","Lucky Penny"
"9161","Ted (voix off)","Kids, the key to a good relationship is communication. You need to talk.","02","16","Stuff"
"9162","Robin","How about Mimi's?","02","16","Stuff"
"9163","Ted","Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's.","02","16","Stuff"
"9164","Robin","Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go.","02","16","Stuff"
"9165","Ted","Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's. You love that place, remember what a great time we had the last time we were there?","02","16","Stuff"
"9166","Robin","We did?","02","16","Stuff"
"9167","Ted","Yeah, yeah. We had that crazy waiter who kept going, ""You two should get married! You two should get married!""","02","16","Stuff"
"9168","Ted (voix off)","It's also important to know when to stop talking.","02","16","Stuff"
"9169","Ted","Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining. It was so romantic? How can you not remember this?","02","16","Stuff"
"9170","Robin","Because it wasn't me.","02","16","Stuff"
"9171","Ted","Oh, right! It was... my sister.","02","16","Stuff"
"9172","Ted (voix off)","You see, by the time you've hit your late 20s, you've dated a few people, but when you're in a relationship, it's common courtesy to pretend that you haven't.","02","16","Stuff"
"9173","Ted","Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on. Remember when we went to see it? We sat in the back row.","02","16","Stuff"
"9174","Robin","I've never seen Van Helsing.","02","16","Stuff"
"9175","Ted","That's right. I saw it with my sister.","02","16","Stuff"
"9176","Robin","My boss just got back from Maui. He said it was really romantic.","02","16","Stuff"
"9177","Ted","Oh, it's so romantic.","02","16","Stuff"
"9178","Robin","When were you in Maui?","02","16","Stuff"
"9179","Ted","I... went... with my sister.","02","16","Stuff"
"9180","Robin","With my sister. Why do you always say that? Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people. It's silly to try to act like we didn't.","02","16","Stuff"
"9181","Ted","You're right. We should just be honest.","02","16","Stuff"
"9182","Robin","Totally.","02","16","Stuff"
"9183","Ted","See that girl over there? Three years ago, I totally made out with her.","02","16","Stuff"
"9184","Robin","I don't want to hear that.","02","16","Stuff"
"9185","Ted","What? You said...","02","16","Stuff"
"9186","Robin","God, that is so insensitive.","02","16","Stuff"
"9187","Ted","Remember honesty...?","02","16","Stuff"
"9188","Robin","You're a jerk!","02","16","Stuff"
"9189","Ted","Well, you're...confusing.","02","16","Stuff"
"9190","Marshall","Okay, so you have to have s*x with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go!","02","16","Stuff"
"9191","Barney","I don't know. Is she fat?","02","16","Stuff"
"9192","Marshall","Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat.","02","16","Stuff"
"9193","Lily","Hot off the presses!","02","16","Stuff"
"9194","Barney","I-I don't take flyers.","02","16","Stuff"
"9195","Marshall","You took one two seconds before you walked in here.","02","16","Stuff"
"9196","Barney","That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?","02","16","Stuff"
"9197","Lily","Fine. It's a flyer from my play.","02","16","Stuff"
"9198","Barney","Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid...","02","16","Stuff"
"9199","Marshall","Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good.","02","16","Stuff"
"9200","Barney","Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this. Asking someone to come see your play is like asking someone for a ride to the airport or to crash on your couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers and repeat after me  Friends don't let friends come see their crappy play.","02","16","Stuff"
"9201","Ted","Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us.","02","16","Stuff"
"9202","Barney","Yes, you should break up.","02","16","Stuff"
"9203","Ted","So, earlier tonight...","02","16","Stuff"
"9204","Robin","Mm, we should get down to the bar.","02","16","Stuff"
"9205","Ted","I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt.","02","16","Stuff"
"9206","Barney","Oh, God, why is this part of the story?","02","16","Stuff"
"9207","Ted","We're getting to it.","02","16","Stuff"
"9208","Robin","Damn, my face is so dry. Is there any moisturizer around here?","02","16","Stuff"
"9209","Ted","Yeah, there's some in the bathroom. Got to moisturize! Got to keep that pretty face moist.","02","16","Stuff"
"9210","Lily","Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!","02","16","Stuff"
"9211","Barney","What's wrong with her?","02","16","Stuff"
"9212","Marshall","She hates that word.","02","16","Stuff"
"9213","Barney","What word, ""moist""?","02","16","Stuff"
"9214","Lily","No! Seriously, stop!","02","16","Stuff"
"9215","Robin","So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist... face lotion...","02","16","Stuff"
"9216","Robin","Wow, this is great stuff. Now I know the secret to your great complexion.","02","16","Stuff"
"9217","Ted","What are you talking about? It's yours.","02","16","Stuff"
"9218","Robin","No, it's not.","02","16","Stuff"
"9219","Ted","Oh, well... then I guess it's Lily's.","02","16","Stuff"
"9220","Lily","No, it's not.","02","16","Stuff"
"9221","Robin","Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?","02","16","Stuff"
"9222","Ted","Um, my sister's.","02","16","Stuff"
"9223","Robin","So, in other words, some girl you went out with.","02","16","Stuff"
"9224","Ted","Um... I love you.","02","16","Stuff"
"9225","Robin","Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?","02","16","Stuff"
"9226","Lily","It was probably Carla's. Her face was a train wreck.","02","16","Stuff"
"9227","Marshall","I'm don't think Ted was dating her for her face.","02","16","Stuff"
"9228","Ted","Thank you, Marshall. Thank you so much.","02","16","Stuff"
"9229","Robin","Why is that still in your apartment?","02","16","Stuff"
"9230","Ted","I don't know. I just never threw it out.","02","16","Stuff"
"9231","Robin","Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl?","02","16","Stuff"
"9232","Ted","Yeah. I'm madly in love with her, and the only way I can deal with it is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion.","02","16","Stuff"
"9233","Robin","Not three dollars! Try 14.","02","16","Stuff"
"9234","Ted","Why is this such a big deal?","02","16","Stuff"
"9235","Robin","Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer!","02","16","Stuff"
"9236","Ted","Whoa, she wasn't a whore.","02","16","Stuff"
"9237","Robin","Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town. It sounds like a whore to me. What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around?","02","16","Stuff"
"9238","Ted","Nothing. That's it. Well, except for the phone booth. And the lamp by the desk... and the...","02","16","Stuff"
"9239","Robin","No. No! No! Oh, Ted!","02","16","Stuff"
"9240","Lily","Ah, the age-old question  after you break up with someone, what do you do with the stuff?","02","16","Stuff"
"9241","Robin","Question? Ain't no question, girl. Obviously, he's got to get rid of it.","02","16","Stuff"
"9242","Ted","Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it.","02","16","Stuff"
"9243","Robin","So we agreed that we would let you guys decide.","02","16","Stuff"
"9244","Ted","Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants.","02","16","Stuff"
"9245","Barney","Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.","02","16","Stuff"
"9246","Marshall","Nice, right?","02","16","Stuff"
"9247","Robin","I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old","02","16","Stuff"
"9248","Lily","Yes!","02","16","Stuff"
"9249","Barney","I vote they can stay. ""Check out the jackass in the parachute pants"" is a good icebreaker.","02","16","Stuff"
"9250","Marshall","Ted. Ted? Ted?","02","16","Stuff"
"9251","Ted","Sorry, buddy, it's a ""no"" for me, too. Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called. Even they don't want those pants back.","02","16","Stuff"
"9252","Marshall","They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside.","02","16","Stuff"
"9253","Barney","Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots.","02","16","Stuff"
"9254","Lily","All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first.","02","16","Stuff"
"9255","Ted","Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal. I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano, I don't think of Jeannie Radford, I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe. And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses. I remember when I was broke, just out of college, and I really needed a lamp. And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein. I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there.","02","16","Stuff"
"9256","Marshall","Creamsicle and turkey gravy, not at the same time.","02","16","Stuff"
"9257","Robin","Well, that's adorable, but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see.","02","16","Stuff"
"9258","Ex-girlfriend 1","I'm Ted's college girlfriend. He made me 12 mix tapes. How many has he made you?","02","16","Stuff"
"9259","Ex-girlfriend 2","He calls you ""sweetie pie""? He called me ""sweetie pie.""","02","16","Stuff"
"9260","Ex-girlfriend 3","I'm stupid, but my rack is bigger than yours.","02","16","Stuff"
"9261","Ted","Really? You can't look at a pillow without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow!","02","16","Stuff"
"9262","Robin","Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross.","02","16","Stuff"
"9263","Ted","You're creepy and gross.","02","16","Stuff"
"9264","Robin","Your mom's creepy and gross.","02","16","Stuff"
"9265","Lily","Order! Order! I got to side with Robin. She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff upsets her, you got to get rid of it.","02","16","Stuff"
"9266","Marshall","I've got to side with Ted. Just 'cause you still have something an ex girlfriend gave you doesn't mean you're holding onto her.","02","16","Stuff"
"9267","Ted","All right, Barney. It all comes down to you.","02","16","Stuff"
"9268","Barney","I side with Robin.","02","16","Stuff"
"9269","Ted","What?","02","16","Stuff"
"9270","Barney","Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.","02","16","Stuff"
"9271","Robin","Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?","02","16","Stuff"
"9272","Ted","Just stop, sweetie.","02","16","Stuff"
"9273","Ted (voix off)","So I had no choice. I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends. It was painful, but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night. New York is famous for its theater, but there's many different levels. There's Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, homeless people screaming in the park, and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in.","02","16","Stuff"
"9274","Robin","Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?","02","16","Stuff"
"9275","Barney","From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory.","02","16","Stuff"
"9276","Ted","Where do you guys want to sit?","02","16","Stuff"
"9277","Barney","I know where I don't want to sit.","02","16","Stuff"
"9278","Marshall (in the front row)","Guys, four together!","02","16","Stuff"

"9293","Barney","Wow, Lily, that sucked!","02","16","Stuff"
"9294","Marshall","Barney!","02","16","Stuff"

"9296","Lily","No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about.","02","16","Stuff"
"9297","Barney","Yeah, if you're a Smurf.","02","16","Stuff"
"9298","Lily","You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards.","02","16","Stuff"

"9310","Ted","What can I say? Papa gets swag.","02","16","Stuff"
"9311","Ted (voix off)","And that should've been the end of it. But the next day...","02","16","Stuff"
"9312","Ted","You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff. But seeing how happy it makes you - totally worth it.","02","16","Stuff"
"9313","Robin","Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have s*x with you when I'm really tired.","02","16","Stuff"
"9314","Ted","Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Well, sit. Sit, yeah. So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?","02","16","Stuff"
"9315","Robin","Nope. Well, except for my dogs.","02","16","Stuff"
"9316","Ted","So I had to get rid of everything from my past relationships because you don't keep things from your past relationships except, uh, where are your five dogs from? Oh, that's right  your past relationships.","02","16","Stuff"
"9317","Robin","What's your point, Ted?","02","16","Stuff"
"9318","Ted","Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment, and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends?","02","16","Stuff"

"9328","Robin","Pickles, go get your ball. Go get your ball.","02","16","Stuff"
"9329","Ted","Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you to make me get rid of all my stuff.","02","16","Stuff"
"9330","Robin","Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs?","02","16","Stuff"
"9331","Man","Guess what position we did it in.","02","16","Stuff"
"9332","Ted","Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs.","02","16","Stuff"
"9333","Robin","Um, no.","02","16","Stuff"

"9344","Lily","Oh, we'll be there.","02","16","Stuff"
"9345","Barney","Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong...","02","16","Stuff"

"9356","Lily","Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh?","02","16","Stuff"
"9357","Robin","Yeah, he really is. It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs. Might be time to send them to the farm.","02","16","Stuff"
"9358","Lily","You're gonna kill your dogs?!","02","16","Stuff"
"9359","Robin","No! No, no, no, there really is a farm. My aunt has a farm upstate.","02","16","Stuff"
"9360","Lily","Oh, thank God. Aw, you know, if I were five dogs, I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn.","02","16","Stuff"
"9361","Robin","Yeah. I could visit them on weekends. My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty.","02","16","Stuff"
"9362","Lily","Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs.","02","16","Stuff"
"9363","Robin","""They""? What do you mean by ""they""?","02","16","Stuff"
"9364","Lily","Uh... uh.... uh... People upstate. Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!","02","16","Stuff"
"9365","Marshall","Are you sure you're gonna be okay? I mean, you know that this is gonna be...","02","16","Stuff"
"9366","Lily","I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do.","02","16","Stuff"
"9367","Barney","Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.","02","16","Stuff"
"9368","Ted (voix off)","That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.","02","16","Stuff"
"9369","Barney","Moist.","02","16","Stuff"
"9370","Ted (voix off)","And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.","02","16","Stuff"
"9371","Barney","I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over.","02","16","Stuff"
"9372","Marshall","I never get picked for audience participation.","02","16","Stuff"
"9373","Ted (voix off)","And then it just got weird.","02","16","Stuff"
"9374","Barney","Feelings. Inside. Oh, no!","02","16","Stuff"

"9380","Lily","Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go.","02","16","Stuff"
"9381","Barney","Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.","02","16","Stuff"
"9382","Lily","Yeah, well, anyway.","02","16","Stuff"
"9383","Barney","Act two is where I really hit my stride. Spoiler alert  the robot falls in love. Lily  How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show?","02","16","Stuff"
"9384","Barney","It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two.","02","16","Stuff"
"9385","Ted (voix off)","So we stayed and let Barney torture us for another hour and a half, 'cause that's what friends do, apparently.","02","16","Stuff"
"9386","Robin","Hey.","02","16","Stuff"
"9387","Ted","Where've you been? I called you earlier.","02","16","Stuff"

"9390","Robin","Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but... I think it's for the best.","02","16","Stuff"
"9391","Ted","Wow. Oh, man.","02","16","Stuff"
"9392","Robin","Can we go inside?","02","16","Stuff"
"9393","Ted","Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar.","02","16","Stuff"
"9394","Robin","Why? What's going on inside?","02","16","Stuff"
"9395","Ted","Um, the floors are gone.","02","16","Stuff"
"9396","Robin","What?","02","16","Stuff"
"9397","Ted","Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed. This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail.","02","16","Stuff"
"9398","Ted","I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!","02","16","Stuff"
"9399","Robin","You said you threw all that stuff away!","02","16","Stuff"
"9400","Ted (voix off)","Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had. It was one of those fights that last for hours and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about. We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window. Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy. But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me, but somehow we got to here.","02","16","Stuff"
"9401","Robin","We're really doing this?","02","16","Stuff"
"9402","Ted","Yeah.","02","16","Stuff"
"9403","Ted and Robin","We're moving in together!","02","16","Stuff"

"9406","Ted","This is awesome.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9407","Marshall","I can't believe this moment's finally here. One more mile and my little boy turns 200,000.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9408","Ted","Your baby Fiero's grown into a really old man Fiero. And just like an old man, he leaks fluid, smells stale, makes weird noises out the back.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9409","Marshall","Yeah, he does. Hey, light up those cigars in the glove compartment. They're real Cubans. I got 'em in Chinatown last year just for this moment.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9410","Ted","Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off, but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9411","Marshal","What are you talking about?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9412","Ted","Whoa, pothole. The car stops.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9413","Marshall","What? No. Oh. No. No, no, no. No, there's only.8 miles to go. Come on, buddy. Buddy!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9414","Ted","Is it cool if I still light these?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9415","Ted (voix off)","Kids, sometimes life forces us to be someone we didn't want to be. When that happens, we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were. Maybe a tattoo. Or a piece of jewelry. A tiny souvenir that reminds us, ""This is who I really am."" Marshall's souvenir was not so tiny, but the more he found himself being pushed toward the corporate world and away from his dream of saving the environment, the tighter he held on to that Fiero.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9416","Ted","Hey. One good thing  we're off the hook for the folding party today.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9417","Marshall","Hey. It's very important to both Lily and me that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our wedding's... I couldn't even get through it. Thank God.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9418","Ted","Hey, your car's going to be fine. This is the best auto shop around. Look at this certificate. One of the mechanics here finished a 64-ounce steak.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9419","Lily","Surprise.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9420","Robin","We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9421","Barney","We insisted.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9422","Ted","Terrific.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9423","Barney","How's the Fiero?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9424","Marshall","She's still in triage.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9425","Ted","She? I thought it was your little boy.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9426","Lily","Oh, it goes back and forth. It's sort of a tranny car.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9427","Robin","How long have you had her... slash him?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9428","Marshall","My brothers handed it down to me when I was 16.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9429","Robin","Oh, how nice of them.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9430","Marshall","Not really.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9431","Brother 1","Congratulations.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9432","Brother 2","The Fiero is yours. If you pass the final test.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9433","Marshall","Come on! I already shaved my legs and swallowed five dollars in quarters. Only $4.50 has come out.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9434","Brother 1","Just go to the Weinerburger drive-thru and get us 12 cups of coffee.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9435","Marshall","That's it?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9436","Brother 2","Oh, yeah. But we get to decide what you wear.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9437","Marshall","Agreed. Totally agreed.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9438","Man","You're naked.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9439","Marshall","I'm aware of that.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9440","Man","You have 50 cents?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9441","Marshall","No... Look, can I just have my coffee, please?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9442","Man","Sorry, we're all out of trays and lids. Two tall guys just came through here a few minutes ago and bought 'em all.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9443","Ted","And that is the origin of Marshall's insane ""no food or drinks in the Fiero, not even groceries"" rule.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9444","Marshall","It is not insane.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9445","Lily","Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9446","Barney","Well, I'm trying, but it's...","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9447","Lily","Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9448","Barney","Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9449","Lily","No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9450","Barney","Aw, nerts.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9451","Ted","The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it. Remember the 100K fiasco?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9452","Marshall","Ah, the Fiero-asco.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9453","Ted","Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9454","Robin","What's the 100K fiasco?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9455","Marshall","The Fiero-asco?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9456","Ted","It was just before winter break our freshman year of college. Marshall and I were roommates, but we weren't really good friends yet.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9457","Marshall","I thought Ted was a little bit pretentious.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9458","Ted","And Marshall was a total slob.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9459","Marshall","Hey (Marshall throws a sandwich in the trash but misses it) I'm driving my Fiero back over break. I know we see enough of each other as it is, but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money. You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9460","Ted","All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio. I live in the moment. Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving. We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so...","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9461","Marshall","All right, well, call me if you change your mind. My odometer's going to hit 100K.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9462","Ted","She'd be so bummed if I left early.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9463","Ted","It was totally mutual. I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I... it was... it was totally mutual.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9464","Marshall","I hear you.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9465","Ted","So what's up with you and Lily? Anything serious","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9466","Marshall","Yeah. Dude, we're college freshmen. I'm not going to get tied down by the first chick I hook up with. Lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9467","Ted(voix off)","The next few hours of our drive were classic road trip.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9468","Ted","So... this song.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9469","Marshall","Oh, it's the best song in the world. It's the only song I like. Just kidding. Tape's been stuck in the player for, like, two years. Better than nothing, though.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9470","Ted","Maybe. I am so... sick... of this song.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9471","Marshall","Don't worry. It comes around again.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9472","Ted","What do you mean?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9473","Ted and Marshall singing","Just to be the man who walks 1,000 miles And falls down at your door...","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9474","Marshall","Yeah, we totally nailed the ending.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9475","Ted","That was probably our best one. Hey, you want to play Zitch Dog?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9476","Marshall","What?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9477","Ted","Uh, it's a car game. Every time you see a dog, you got to be the first one to say, ""Zitch dog."" I'm pretty good, so...","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9478","Marshall","Zitch dog.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9479","Ted","Well, no, I didn't know we had...we'd started, but... Okay, that's cool. You got the first point.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9480","Marshall","Zitch dog.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9481","Ted","Zitch dog. Damn it!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9482","Ted","Are we still playing? 'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9483","Marshall","12-nothing.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9484","Ted","Marshall. Marshall.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9485","Marshall","Zitch dog, blue Suburban.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9486","Ted","Damn it!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9487","Marshall","18-nothing.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9488","Ted (voix off)","Then Marshall, who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog, got us totally lost.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9489","Marshall","Where the hell are we?!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9490","Marshall","Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I think you skipped something.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9491","Barney","Really? Seems impossible.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9492","Ted","Hey, we got some time. What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know? Robert Frost.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9493","Marshall","Doesn't seem like a smart idea.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9494","Ted","Too late. I'm taking this exit. Who's not fun enough now, Karen?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9495","Marshall","Then we got lost. Where the hell are we?! I'm pulling over.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9496","Ted","No, keep driving.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9497","Marshall","We're almost out of gas, and we might not even be on a road anymore.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9498","Ted","It's below zero out. If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days. Plus, I only have, like, six granola bars and three bottles of water.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9499","Marshall","Nah, I threw them out.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9500","Ted","What?!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9501","Marshall","No food or drink in the Fiero.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9502","Ted","No food or drink in the F...? You haven't washed your sheets since... (Voix off)  Thus began the longest night of our lives.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9503","Marshall","Pretty sure that my foot is frozen solid.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9504","Ted","Marshall... there's a very real chance that we're gonna be snowed in here for days. If I die first, do whatever you need to survive. Eat my flesh. Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9505","Marshall","Thanks, Ted. You're a good friend. And if I die first, you just leave my body alone.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9506","Ted","What? I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9507","Marshall","Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me; it skeeves me out.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9508","Ted","But... but you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9509","Marshall","Wasn't an easy decision.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9510","Ted","This is all because of your insane no-food rule.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9511","Marshall","It's perfectly rational.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9512","Ted","Hey! My spectacles! Hey. I know we're low on gas, but can we turn on the heat for just a minute?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9513","Marshall","Okay. Dude... I hate to say this... but it's so cold... there's only one way that we're gonna make it through this night.(they're both in the back seat in each other arms) We should've kept driving.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9514","Ted","Come on, Marshall.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9515","Marshall","No. No. We might die now. I may never see Lily again. I never told anybody this, but... I've known for a long time that I'm gonna marry that girl. If we survive this, someday I'm gonna marry her. I'm sorry about your spectacles.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9516","Ted","That's okay. They were decorative. Hey, Marshall.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9517","Marshall","Yeah?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9518","Ted","Are you still thinking about Lily?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9519","Marshall","Yeah.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9520","Ted","Please stop.(voix off) And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere. But funny thing...","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9521","Man","Hey. You lovers better just keep on driving.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9522","Marshall","Zitch dog!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9523","Ted","Damn it!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9524","Lily","You said you were gonna marry me that long ago? That is so sweet.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9525","Ted","That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9526","Barney","With privileges, from the sound of it.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9527","Mechanic","Eriksen. (Marshall follows the mechanic)","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9528","Barney","Wow. Looks like he really needs a hug. Ted.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9529","Marshall","He said it would be at least 3,000 bucks to make it run again. And even then, there's no guarantee.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9530","Ted","Well, it's a pretty old car.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9531","Robin","Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life, but it's really mostly machine at this point.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9532","Marshall","I know that it's a lot of money, but it's my Fiero, you know? I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job, and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9533","Barney","How dare you...","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9534","Robibn","Hey.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9535","Marshall","I've been through so much in that car. The suicidal cat.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9536","Marshall","Hitchhiking Waldo. (a guy is sitting between Barney and Marshall in the car)The homeless guy who broke in through the window and threw up all over the backseat.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9537","Robin","Lily, don't. Be strong. Do not go all ""prisoner's dilemma"" on me.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9538","Lily","The car's on its deathbed, Robin. I have to clear my conscience.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9539","Marshall","Guys, what are you talking about?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9540","Lily","Okay. Shortly after we met Robin, she and I were jonesing for Thai food from this one place.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9541","Robin","An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9542","Lily","I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9543","Robin","But Thai food, Lily. Pad Yum Mao. Tom Kai Gah. Thai See Ran.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9544","Lily","Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious. Okay. Here's what we'll do. We'll drive over, pick it up, have them double-bag it, very carefully drive it back here with the windows open, and he'll never know. (Lily slows down the car and knock down the food). Wow, these brakes are really sensitive. Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me! This and the difference between ""affect"" and ""effect"" are the only two things he's really serious about.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9545","Robin","Lily, it's gonna be fine.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9546","Lily","No, it's not. Marshall's gonna freak. Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do? Oh, God, oh...!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9547","Robin","Shut up! Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking. Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage. Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts-- the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up. Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai. You mentioned cigars.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9548","Lily","There's two in the glove compartment, but he's been saving them.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9549","Robin","Hand me those chopsticks. Hey, how about some tunes? Oh, great song.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9550","Lily","These cigars aren't helping at all.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9551","Robin","Yeah. This was a terrible idea.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9552","Lily","Now it just smells like a homeless guy threw up in here. End of flasback.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9553","Marshall","The broken windows?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9554","Lily","We had to make it look realistic.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9555","Marshall","Why did you break two of them?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9556","Robin","It looked like fun when she did it. So I wanted to try.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9557","Marshall","Can't believe this whole time it was you guys. I've been blaming really tanned dancing leotard guy.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9558","Lily","Marshall, I'm so sorry, but sharing that secret-- that's when Robin and I became best friends.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9559","Mechanic","Wow. What a special car. So, can I crush it into a little cube yet?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9560","Marshall","I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9561","Barney","Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9562","Robin","Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9563","Barney","Love it? Hold on a second. Love it? I hate it!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9564","Lily","What? Why?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9565","Barney","Why? Why? Why?! Why?!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9566","Ted","Let me tell it. It was last year during the transit strike.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9567","Ted","Hey.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9568","Barney","Hey. Uh, is Marshall around? I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9569","Ted","Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9570","Barney","Hey! Why don't you drive me? It'll be like a total road trip.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9571","Ted","To Queens?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9572","Barney","Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9573","Ted","Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9574","Barney","Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel. See you later.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9575","Ted","Wait! You know how to drive, right?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9576","Barney","What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving. Hitting the road. Cruising the lanes. And braking. Honking. Love it. Except for lady drivers. Don't get me started on lady drivers.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9577","Ted","Which pedal's the gas?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9578","Barney","Trick question.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9579","Ted","No, it's not","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9580","Barney","Yes, it is.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9581","Ted","No, it's not.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9582","Barney","Middle, left, right? I never learned how to drive! I grew up in the city. I never had a chance.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9583","Ted","Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9584","Barney","This isn't right. God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9585","Ted","Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9586","Barney","Dude, a dog.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9587","Ted","Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9588","Barney","What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9589","Ted","Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9590","Barney","Which? Which one's the break again?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9591","Ted","The left one.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9592","Barney","Left. Oh, man, left. I'm totally blanking.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9593","Ted","Make the Ls","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9594",".Barney","Oh, we're not going to make it.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9595","Ted","Why did you just turn on the radio?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9596","Barney","I don't know why I turned on the radio! We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9597","Ted","Relax. You're being crazy.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9598","Barney","Help me, Ted! I'm being serious.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9599","Ted","Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9600","Barney","I can't move. I can't... I can't feel my... Wait. Wait. We're okay.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9601","Ted","We're okay.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9602","Barney","We're okay. It's a miracle, Ted!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9603","Robin","Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9604","Ted","Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he...","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9605","Barney","ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina hummina. I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap. But fate... fate gave me a second chance. And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander. So I decided from that moment on to continue living life to its fullest.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9606","Lily","So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9607","Barney","True story.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9608","Marshall","Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9609","Barney","Yes!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9610","Ted and Robin","What?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9611","Marshall","It's lived a great life and it deserves to die with dignity.Ted  But 200,000...","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9612","Marshall","But that's life. You know? You never end up where you thought you wanted to be. I'm not helping the environment. Ted's not a philosopher. Lily's not not a world-famous artist. Barney's never driven more than ten miles an hour. Robin, I'm sure, has also experience disappointment in her life. Maybe? And my Fiero's not a Fiero that went 200,000 miles. It's okay. You know? Those are old dreams. We'll get a new car and we'll fill that one up with new memories. And that'll be the car we had when we were first married. When we owned our first house. Maybe even the first car our four kids remember.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9613","Lily","That's so sweet. The first car our two kids remember.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9614","Marshall","I would like to say good-bye. Marshall is in the car and the other are around it. Marshall taps the dashboard and the cassette goes out.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9615","Ted","You know what? This Fiero, it's effected all our lives.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9616","Marshall","Affected.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9617","Ted","That's what I said.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9618","Marshall","Just making sure. Got us all a lot of places. I mean maybe it's time we return the favor. This Fiero should have made it to 200,000. So, let's get it out that door. And we'll push it the last.7 miles. It'd do the same for us. Marshall puts the cassette back in and they all start to push.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9619","Maechanic","Hey, geniuses. The back wheels are on blocks. That car ain't going anywhere.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9620","Marshall","Close enough!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9621","All","Close enough!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9622","Ted (voix off)","And so Marshall said good-bye to his Fiero. And as the car's final gift to us all, the money he got for scrap parts paid our bar tab for the next two nights.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9623","Marshall","Arrivederci, Fiero! You were the freaking giving tree of cars.Lily  May you rust in peace.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9624","Barney","Rot in hell, devil steed.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9625","Ted (voix off)","And what better friend is there than that?","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9626","Marshall","Bro. Have you heard this new song? I just got the cassingle.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9627","Brother","Put it in.","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9628","Marshall","I am never going to get sick of this song. Never, ever, never, never, ever. Yeah!","02","17","Arrivederci, Fiero"
"9629","So, I can have the moving truck here by 8","00 am.","02","18","Moving Day"
"9630","Hey, hypothetical question","if I was all your stuff, would I rather be at the bottom of the East River or The Hudson?","02","18","Moving Day"
"9631","The category","top ten things I would've called my truck...","02","18","Moving Day"

"9633","Ted (2030)","When the marriage approched, some weird stuff started happening.","02","20","Showdown"
"9634","Lily","Why does my stomach hurt?","02","20","Showdown"
"9635","Marshall","I'm sorry, baby. I ate a bunch of ice cream earlier today.","02","20","Showdown"
"9636","Lily","Oh, baby, you know we're lactose-intolerant.","02","20","Showdown"
"9637","Tes","Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you suggesting that when one of you feels something, the other feels it, too? Oh, God, you guys are so codependent.","02","20","Showdown"
"9638","Lily","No, we're not.","02","20","Showdown"
"9639","Ted","Oh, really? What about the other day?","02","20","Showdown"
"9640","Lily","Oh, I need to get some eggs.","02","20","Showdown"
"9641","Marshall","Oh, I'll come with you.","02","20","Showdown"
"9642","Marshall","Just because we like spending time together doesn't mean we're codependent.","02","20","Showdown"
"9643","Barney","Really? Then whatever happened to your plan of spending the last two weeks before your wedding sleeping apart?","02","20","Showdown"
"9644","Marshall","Okay, we decided not to do that because of...","02","20","Showdown"
"9645","Lily","Logistics. Wedding logistics.","02","20","Showdown"
"9646","Marshall","Frickin' logistics, man. They mess everything up.","02","20","Showdown"
"9647","Ted","You didn't do it because you couldn't do it.","02","20","Showdown"
"9648","Marshall","Sure we could.","02","20","Showdown"
"9649","Robin","Then why don't you? You can stay with me.","02","20","Showdown"
"9650","Lily","It would make our wedding night more special.","02","20","Showdown"
"9651","Marshall","Okay, let's do it.","02","20","Showdown"
"9652","Lily","Done.","02","20","Showdown"
"9653","Marshall","I'm gonna go grab a beer.","02","20","Showdown"
"9654","Lily","I'll come with you. No. I'll stay.","02","20","Showdown"
"9655","Lily","Okay, I know. You know? I got to go. Good-bye. My mom's driving me cra....","02","20","Showdown"
"9656","Ted","Long story. I'll tell you later.","02","20","Showdown"
"9657","Barney","Yeah. It's a dirty story, isn't it? You guys went out to dinner, did it in the kitchen and got caught. Scherbatsky reeks of someone who likes to get caught.","02","20","Showdown"
"9658","Robin","Okay, now I have to wash up for two reasons.","02","20","Showdown"
"9659","Marshall","Oh, you didn't. That's right.","02","20","Showdown"
"9660","Barney","So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart?","02","20","Showdown"
"9661","Marshall","You know what, Barney? Lily and I are a lot less chees than you make us out to be.","02","20","Showdown"
"9662","Lily","Marshmallow, don't forget to pack my night-night tape.","02","20","Showdown"
"9663","Barney","Night-night tape? Did you make a tape of you saying ""night-night"" to her?","02","20","Showdown"
"9664","Marshall","No.","02","20","Showdown"
"9665","Lily","He doesn't say it. He sings it.","02","20","Showdown"
"9666","Barney","Oh, that is so sweet. Why don't you kiss? I love it when two chicks make out.","02","20","Showdown"
"9667","Lily","Damn it. Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.","02","20","Showdown"
"9668","Barney","What's on there?","02","20","Showdown"
"9669","Lily","Ooh, lots of stuff. Kitchen Aide Artisan Series tilt-head stand mixer...","02","20","Showdown"
"9670","Barney","Retail price $319.99. What else?","02","20","Showdown"
"9671","Lily","Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum.","02","20","Showdown"
"9672","Barney","Ah, $549.99. A little greedy, don't you think?","02","20","Showdown"
"9673","Marshall","Did you memorize our registry?","02","20","Showdown"
"9674","Barney","No, I'm training.","02","20","Showdown"
"9675","Marshall","Training? For what?","02","20","Showdown"
"9676","Barney","I'm glad you asked. Ted, Robin, get in here! You guys know how it's hard to be friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?","02","20","Showdown"
"9677","Ted","Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on.","02","20","Showdown"
"9678","Barney","Well, this isn't going to make it any easier. I am going to be on... The Price Is Right.","02","20","Showdown"
"9679","Marshall","No way!","02","20","Showdown"
"9680","Ted","What?!","02","20","Showdown"
"9681","Barney","Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields is going to call out my name, and I will come on down.","02","20","Showdown"
"9682","Marshall","Whoa, that is so awesome.","02","20","Showdown"
"9683","Robin","Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right.","02","20","Showdown"
"9684","Barney","Are you kidding? T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television, it's a microcosm of our entire economic system-- a capitalist utopia, where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit. I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right, and I see the face of America. And it is divine. Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars.","02","20","Showdown"
"9685","Ted (2030)","Then Lily headed out to Robin's for her first night away from Marshall.","02","20","Showdown"
"9686","Lily","I'm ready! Lily comes into the livingroom with her wedding dress while Robin singins.)","02","20","Showdown"

"9688","Lily","I know! I'm beautiful! I'm a fairy princess! (she raises her arms and the dress falls.) I'm too skinny for my dress!","02","20","Showdown"
"9689","Ted(2030)","Meanwhile, I was testing out my best man toast on Marshall.","02","20","Showdown"
"9690","Ted","Here goes. Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Strong opening, right?","02","20","Showdown"
"9691","Marshall","That's fantastic.","02","20","Showdown"
"9692","Ted","When Marshall graduates this spring, he'll be a lawyer. But did you know that Marshall has a criminal record? That's right, on a road trip up to Cape Cod, Marshall was pulled over for driving by himself in a car pool lane.","02","20","Showdown"
"9693","Marshall","Oh, crap.","02","20","Showdown"
"9694","Lily","Oh, crap.","02","20","Showdown"
"9695","Marshall","Are you crazy? You cannot tell that story at my wedding. My entire family's gonna be there. My little cousins, my mom, my grandma, my grandpa the minister.","02","20","Showdown"
"9696","Ted","That grandpa died three years ago.","02","20","Showdown"
"9697","Marshall","His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted. I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance.","02","20","Showdown"
"9698","Barney","So which one, ""A"" or ""B""?","02","20","Showdown"
"9699","Marshall","What was that?","02","20","Showdown"
"9700","Barney","I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, ""Barney Stinson, come on down!""","02","20","Showdown"
"9701","Ted","Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?","02","20","Showdown"
"9702","Barney","Yeah, of course.","02","20","Showdown"
"9703","Barney","Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.","02","20","Showdown"
"9704","Lily","It's $300 just to take the bust in? Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me. I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress. I lost all this weight without even trying. Hello?","02","20","Showdown"
"9705","Robin","What happened?","02","20","Showdown"
"9706","Lily","She called me a bitch and hung up. Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just have to pay the $300.","02","20","Showdown"
"9707","Robin","Pay the $300? Lily, are you crazy? This isn't a problem. It's a license to eat. Look, what have you always wanted to eat but didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?","02","20","Showdown"
"9708","Lily","Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate soufflée with a raspberry brandy sauce topped with caramelized bananas and hazelnut gelato.","02","20","Showdown"
"9709","Robin","I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos.","02","20","Showdown"
"9710","Lily","Done!","02","20","Showdown"
"9711","Ted","Okay, think you're gonna be happy with my new toast. There's nothing sexual. It's, uh, it's just the story of an important moment in your relationship.","02","20","Showdown"
"9712","Marshall","I'm all ears. Hello, everyone,","02","20","Showdown"
"9713","Ted","I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.","02","20","Showdown"
"9714","Marshall","Nice.","02","20","Showdown"
"9715","Ted","Right? That's great. Back when we were all freshman and Marshall and Lily were just a few short weeks into their relationship... It was 4 00 in the morning, and I'm not gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted. We were starving. So I'd gone out to get us some snacks, and when I got back...","02","20","Showdown"
"9716","Marshall","I love you.","02","20","Showdown"
"9717","Lily","I love you, too. I know it's soon to say it, but I'm so glad you did.","02","20","Showdown"
"9718","Marshall","Yeah. Ted leaves the room.","02","20","Showdown"
"9719","Marshall","So here's what you want to talk about in front of my entire family  drinking, having a girl in my room, eating junk food.","02","20","Showdown"
"9720","Ted","Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food?","02","20","Showdown"
"9721","Marshall","Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's not important. Also, so Lily's never heard that story before. How's she going to react when she finds out the first time I said ""I love you"" to her, I was actually saying it to you and a bag of Funyuns","02","20","Showdown"
"9722","Ted","But who cares? You did love her. And you still do. And you're totally over Funyuns, so it's not weird.","02","20","Showdown"
"9723","Marshall","Hey, Lil.","02","20","Showdown"
"9724","Lily","Hey.","02","20","Showdown"
"9725","Ted","Hey? That's it?","02","20","Showdown"
"9726","Marshall","What are you talking about?","02","20","Showdown"
"9727","Ted","Well, you guys have been spending the last few nights apart. I figured there'd be a lot of giggling, crying, jumping up and down, and then whatever Lily would do","02","20","Showdown"
"9728","Ted (2030)","Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.","02","20","Showdown"
"9729","Barney","Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready? (he turnst he wheel)","02","20","Showdown"
"9730","Marshall","Oh, wow, that was pretty close.","02","20","Showdown"
"9731","Barney","Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined!","02","20","Showdown"
"9732","Ted","What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?","02","20","Showdown"
"9733","Barney","Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father.","02","20","Showdown"
"9734","Ted","Your father?","02","20","Showdown"
"9735","Barney","That's right. My father... is Bob Barker.","02","20","Showdown"
"9736","Ted","Your dad... is Bob Barker?","02","20","Showdown"
"9737","Barney","That's right","02","20","Showdown"
"9738","Lily","The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?","02","20","Showdown"
"9739","Barney","That's Pops.","02","20","Showdown"
"9740","Robin","Barney?","02","20","Showdown"
"9741","Bareney","Yes, Robin?","02","20","Showdown"
"9742","Robin","Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?","02","20","Showdown"
"9743","Barney","Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.","02","20","Showdown"
"9744","Barney","Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?","02","20","Showdown"
"9745","Barney's mom","Oh, I don't know. That guy. (she shows him Bob Barker on TV)","02","20","Showdown"
"9746","Barney(in front oft he tv)","Look, Dad, I got straight A's!","02","20","Showdown"
"9747","Bareny (dressed as Bob Barker)","Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going as for Halloween?","02","20","Showdown"
"9748","Barney (throwing a ball at the TV)","Want to play some catch, Pop?","02","20","Showdown"
"9749","Barney","So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am.","02","20","Showdown"
"9750","Ted","You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?","02","20","Showdown"
"9751","Barney","Why is this so hard for you people to believe?","02","20","Showdown"
"9752","Robin","Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there.","02","20","Showdown"
"9753","Lily","This is the best wedding diet ever.","02","20","Showdown"
"9754","Lily","I lost a pound.","02","20","Showdown"
"9755","Robin","That is impossible. You ate McDonald's every meal for three days.","02","20","Showdown"
"9756","Lily","I knew that Super Size Me guy was full of it.","02","20","Showdown"
"9757","Robin","Well, it must be the wedding stress. We just got to up the intake. Lily Aldrin, drop and give me 20 bites of fudge! Okay? Don't nibble at it. Attack it! Come on, Lily. You can do better than that!","02","20","Showdown"
"9758","Lily","I can't.","02","20","Showdown"
"9759","Robin","Well, eat faster, before your body figures out it's full.","02","20","Showdown"
"9760","Lily","I'm trying.","02","20","Showdown"
"9761","Robin","Oh, are you gonna cry? You gonna cry? Skinny little baby's gonna cry? Well, eat, damn it, eat!","02","20","Showdown"
"9762","Lily","Okay!","02","20","Showdown"
"9763","Ted","Hey, so I think I figured out how to do your toast in a completely appropriate way.","02","20","Showdown"
"9764","Marshall","Finally.","02","20","Showdown"
"9765","Ted","Yeah. Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.","02","20","Showdown"
"9766","Marshall","Still strong, right?","02","20","Showdown"
"9767","Ted","Great, yeah. I'd like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall","02","20","Showdown"
"9768","Ted","when Marshall and Lily got back together. Afterward, we stayed up till 10 00 at night, doing shots of chocolate milk.","02","20","Showdown"
"9769","Ted (last year)","Man, I'm well nourished right now!","02","20","Showdown"
"9770","Barney","Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.","02","20","Showdown"
"9771","Robin","Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us you don't need alcohol to have fun.","02","20","Showdown"
"9772","Marshall","Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents for teaching me good values.","02","20","Showdown"
"9773","Ted","Now, I wasn't supposed to hear this next part, but Marshall leaned over to Lily and whispered.","02","20","Showdown"
"9774","Marshall","You know what I'd like to do to you right now? I'd like to hold your hand. I'd like to hold your hand so hard that you're not able to shake hands for a week.","02","20","Showdown"
"9775","Lily","Are you just going to talk about holding my hand or are you going to hold it?","02","20","Showdown"
"9776","Ted","Then a little later, Robin caught them... Oh, um......holding hands. End flashback. It was a lovely and responsible night. To Marshall and Lily.","02","20","Showdown"
"9777","Marshall","That's the worst toast I've ever heard, dude. It's totally boring.","02","20","Showdown"
"9778","Ted","Exactly. It's impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me, man. I give up. I'm just going to read that thing about Jesus and the footprints.","02","20","Showdown"
"9779","Lily","I give up, too. I don't care if my dress doesn't fit. I can't eat anymore. I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode.","02","20","Showdown"
"9780","Marshall","I know.","02","20","Showdown"
"9781","Ted","And so, Lily and I were both about to give up, but as you can all see, Lily does look beautiful in that dress, and here I am giving a toast. You know, all this time, I'd been wracking my brain trying to pick out the perfect moment to capture Lily and Marshall as a couple. But then I realized the perfect moment wasn't some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together. The perfect Lily and Marshall moment happened two nights ago.","02","20","Showdown"
"9782","Ted","Marshall, what are you doing?","02","20","Showdown"
"9783","Marshall","Going to the bathroom.","02","20","Showdown"
"9784","Ted","In the hall?","02","20","Showdown"
"9785","Marshall","Sleepwalking?","02","20","Showdown"
"9786","Ted","You're wide awake.","02","20","Showdown"
"9787","Marshall","Robbing us?","02","20","Showdown"
"9788","Ted","Dude.","02","20","Showdown"
"9789","Ted (giving the toast)","Turns out, all week long he'd been sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd, to meet Lily.","02","20","Showdown"
"9790","Lily","God, I missed you.","02","20","Showdown"
"9791","Marshall","I can't sleep without you. Hey, baby? Would you be the big spoon for a while?","02","20","Showdown"
"9792","Lily","Sure, baby.","02","20","Showdown"
"9793","Marshall","How's the weight gaining going?","02","20","Showdown"
"9794","Lily","Ugh, terribly. I'm too stressed out without you around.","02","20","Showdown"
"9795","Marshall","Well, I'm here now.","02","20","Showdown"
"9796","Ted(giving the toast)","And so Lily and Marshall failed in their experiment with apartness, but they succeeded in getting Lily into her dress. You know, there really are a million things I could tell you about Lily and Marshall, but really, the only thing you need to know is that ten years into their relationship, they still couldn't spend a single night apart. May they never have to again. To Lily and Marshall.","02","20","Showdown"
"9797","All","To Lily and Marshall.","02","20","Showdown"
"9798","Ted (2030)","Now, kids, the story of Lily and Marshall's wedding is a good one. No matter how perfectly you plan your... You know, wait a second, guys. I'll get to that. First, I've got to tell you what happened with Barney.","02","20","Showdown"
"9799","Bob","Rich, what is the name of our next participant?","02","20","Showdown"
"9800","Rich","Bob, it's Barney Stinson! Come on down! You're the next contestant on The Price Is Right.","02","20","Showdown"
"9801","Barney","Nooo. Oh, my God!","02","20","Showdown"
"9802","Bob","Working his way out. High-five here, high-five there. A big old hug here.","02","20","Showdown"
"9803","At the apartment, all","Oh, my God!","02","20","Showdown"
"9804","At the apartment, Barney","Yeah, I know, the camera loves me.","02","20","Showdown"
"9805","Bob","Welcome to contestant's row, Barney. Nice suit.","02","20","Showdown"
"9806","Barney","Thanks, Da... Bob.","02","20","Showdown"
"9807","Bob","Here is the next item up for bid!","02","20","Showdown"
"9808","Rich","Bob, the stylish his-and-her watches feature an 18k gold bezel and crown and stainless steel bands.","02","20","Showdown"
"9809","Bob","And Barney, what do you bid on that?","02","20","Showdown"
"9810","Barney","Um... Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob.","02","20","Showdown"
"9811","Bob","$1,350 for Barney.","02","20","Showdown"
"9812","At the apartment, Lily","So, was it $1,350?","02","20","Showdown"
"9813","At the apartment, Barney","I don't know. Was it?","02","20","Showdown"
"9814","At the apartment, Barney","Happy wedding.","02","20","Showdown"
"9815","Bob","Barney, you won that camcorder in just one second! That is impressive. I mean impressive.","02","20","Showdown"
"9816","Barney","Thank you, Bob.","02","20","Showdown"
"9817","Bob","Now, to win the computer, you're going to have to bid again, and again I will say higher or lower. And let's show the audience the price of the computer, and audience, please, do not try to help us. And the clock will start with your first bid.","02","20","Showdown"
"9818","Barney","$1 billion.","02","20","Showdown"
"9819","Bob","Lower.","02","20","Showdown"
"9820","Barney","So, I brought some photos that I thought you might like to see. This is me on my first birthday.","02","20","Showdown"
"9821","Bob","Yes, Barney. This is...","02","20","Showdown"
"9822","At the apartment, Ted","What are you doing?","02","20","Showdown"
"9823","At the apartment, Barney","Uh, spending some quality time with my dad.","02","20","Showdown"
"9824","Bob","That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding.","02","20","Showdown"
"9825","Barney","No, no, I want you to see this. This is great.","02","20","Showdown"
"9826","Bob","Keep bidding.","02","20","Showdown"
"9827","Bob","That, no, that's nice. That's nice. You have only five, four, three, two, one...","02","20","Showdown"
"9828","Barney","$999.","02","20","Showdown"
"9829","Bob","Nine... Barney, you got it exactly right!","02","20","Showdown"
"9830","At the apartment, Barney","Happy wedding again!","02","20","Showdown"
"9831","At the apartement, Lily","Oh, my...","02","20","Showdown"
"9832","Barney","I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel is the only weak part of my game.","02","20","Showdown"
"9833","Bob","I'm sure you'll do just fine, son.","02","20","Showdown"
"9834","Barney","Did you just... I'm ready, Bob.","02","20","Showdown"
"9835","Bob","Do it! Do it! Here we go! He's looking for the dollar. It's going around, and around...","02","20","Showdown"
"9836","At the apartment, Ted","Oh, no, you spun it too hard.","02","20","Showdown"
"9837","At the apartment, Robin","No, he didn't spin it hard enough.","02","20","Showdown"
"9838","Bob","Here it comes, Barney. You got it! You won... But Barney... Barney, you're not through. You've won $1,000. You've won a place in the showcase. You are doing splendidly so far.","02","20","Showdown"
"9839","Barney","Thank you, would you, would you say you're proud of me?","02","20","Showdown"
"9840","Bob","Sure.","02","20","Showdown"
"9841","At the apartment, Ted","That was kind of a weird moment.","02","20","Showdown"
"9842","Bob","Very well, Barney, you have seen the first showcase. Do you want to bid on it or do you want to pass it to Millie?","02","20","Showdown"
"9843","Barney","Please, no car and an above-ground spa? Pass.","02","20","Showdown"
"9844","Bob","Millie, he has passed this showcase to you. What do you bid on it?","02","20","Showdown"
"9845","Millie","$17,640.","02","20","Showdown"
"9846","Bob","$17,640.","02","20","Showdown"
"9847","Barney","Overbid!","02","20","Showdown"
"9848","Bob","Now, let's see Showcase #2. Barney, your showcase begins with a mystery.","02","20","Showdown"
"9849","Barney","Oh, I love this.","02","20","Showdown"
"9850","At the apartment, Robin","I can't believe how excited I am right now","02","20","Showdown"
"9851","Bob","Barney, you have seen your showcase. What do you bid on it?","02","20","Showdown"
"9852","Barney","Please, please. Please. Let me. 1-8-4-2-1.","02","20","Showdown"
"9853","At the apartment, Marshall","I don't even know what we're going to do with a dune buggy, but I want it!","02","20","Showdown"
"9854","Bob","And the actual retail price of your showcase is...","02","20","Showdown"
"9855","Barney","$14,628.","02","20","Showdown"
"9856","Bob","$14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... $18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney. Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet...","02","20","Showdown"
"9857","Barney","Before, before we wrap up the show, there's just something I want to say to you.... Congratulations on 35 wonderful years hosting The Price Is Right.","02","20","Showdown"
"9858","Bob","Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you...","02","20","Showdown"
"9859","Barney","Have your pets spayed or neutered.","02","20","Showdown"
"9860","Ted","Why didn't you tell him?","02","20","Showdown"
"9861","Barney","Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it.","02","20","Showdown"
"9862","Ted","Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.","02","20","Showdown"
"9863","Barney","Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again!","02","20","Showdown"
"9864","Ted (2030)","And that's the story of how Uncle Barney gave Lily and Marshall a dune buggy for their wedding.","02","20","Showdown"
"9865","Marshall","Um, I thought since we're going to be apart for two whole weeks, I would sing you your night-night song. Night-night, Lily Night-night, Lily It's time to go to bed, oh, my silly, little Lily Time to rest your little head Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Come on, Ted.","02","20","Showdown"
"9866","Ted","No, it's weird.","02","20","Showdown"
"9867","Marshall","You promised.","02","20","Showdown"
"9868","Ted","Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la","02","20","Showdown"
"9869","Ted (2030)","In May of 2007, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall got married at the historic Van Smoot House in upstate New York.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9870","Robin","Wow, it's beautiful, Lily.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9871","Lily","Yeah. It's just how I always pictured it.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9872","Lily","So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9873","Barney","And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9874","Robin","But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9875","Barney","Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, ""I do."" Yeah.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9876","Ted (2030)","The closer you get to the big day, the more concessions you make.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9877","Lily","Great. Now my mom's making me invite the Lessners. This puts our numbers in the triple digits.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9878","Robin","Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9879","Ted","Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9880","Marshall","You know what? That's okay. It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9881","Lily","So it's not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore. Marshall's dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in New York, he's going to get mugged, so it's going to be inside now. It'll be great. We're still going to have our acoustic guitar player.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9882","Lily","So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9883","Barney","Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross ""harp player"" off my list.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9884","Marshall","How long is this list?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9885","Barney","Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9886","Lily","Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9887","Barney","Sweet! I can cross off two things.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9888","Ted (2030)","And the day arrives for Lily and Marshall's very big indoor wedding... with a harp.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9889","Andrea","Hi, Lily.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9890","Lily","Wow. Andrea. You really are pregnant.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9891","Andrea","Yeah.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9892","Robin","How do you play the harp with your belly so...?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9893","Andrea","Oh, I don't really-- I can only reach about half the strings.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9894","Robin","You only play half the harp?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9895","Andrea","Yeah.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9896","Robin","Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9897","Andrea","I've been studying the harp for 12 years.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9898","Robin","Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of ""Guitar Hero""? Learned that in a day. Is there a ""Harp Hero""?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9899","Lily","Robin, it's fine. So, so, when are you due?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9900","Andrea","Tuesday.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9901","Lily","Wow, that's soon.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9902","Andrea","Last Tuesday.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9903","Robin","Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9904","Lily","Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, ""Oh, my wedding has to be perfect."" Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9905","Barney","Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9906","Barman","No. I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9907","Barney","Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9908","Barman","I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9909","Barney","You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9910","Barney","Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? ""Hey, baby, want to pluck?""","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9911","Robin","Really? That didn't work.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9912","Barney","Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9913","Lily","Bill?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9914","Barney","Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9915","Bill","Can I ask you something? Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9916","Barney","Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9917","Bill","Oh, so when do you think someone should do it? Just wait for a lull or what?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9918","Lily","Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9919","Barney","He kind of did.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9920","Lily","That's Scooter.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9921","Robin","Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9922","Lily","His real name is Bill. My mom must have invited him.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9923","Robin","Why? Why would she do that?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9924","Lily","Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9925","Barney","I'll get it.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9926","Lily","Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9927","Barney","He's great. He's about to get his hair cut.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9928","Lily","Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9929","Barney","Me, too. I was up all night.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9930","Scooter","Hello, Lily.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9931","Barney","Hey, Bill.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9932","Scooter","Hey, Barney.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9933","Lily","Scooter, what are you doing here?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9934","Scooter","It's not ""Scooter"" anymore. It's Bill. A lot of things have changed about me, Lily, but one hasn't. I still love you. And I came here to win you back.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9935","Lily","You're really cute. Oh, no. Really?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9936","Lily","I want... I want... Scooter!","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9937","Barney","I need a glass of wine.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9938","Barman","And I need you to get out of my face.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9939","Barney","It's for the bride, so...","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9940","Barney","White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9941","Barman","You got it.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9942","Barney","She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9943","Barman","I don't have any, but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9944","Barney","Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9945","Barney","Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9946","Scooter","Maybe my words won't change your mind, but maybe the words of a poet will. I read from ""November Rain."" By W. Axl Rose.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9947","Robin","That is a good song.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9948","Brad","Barney said you needed me to bounce some guy named Scooter?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9949","Brad","What's up with Bill?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9950","Robin","That's Scooter.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9951","Brad","I'm on it.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9952","Barney","Hey.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9953","Woman","Hey.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9954","Barney","Can I have your phone number?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9955","Woman","No.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9956","Barney","It's for the bride.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9957","Woman","Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9958","Barney","The bride wants you to walk slower.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9959","Robin","Oh, wow.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9960","Lily","Oh. Robin... My makeup looks perfect right now, and I'm about to cry. Do something.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9961","Robin","I have hairy nipples.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9962","Lily","Really?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9963","Robin","No, but it worked, didn't it?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9964","Brad","Hey. Funny story. I tackled this guy I thought was Scooter. Turns out it was your photographer. Don't worry. I got this sweet camera phone, so we're covered.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9965","Robin","There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call...","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9966","Lily","Robin, stop. Stop. It's okay. I am not gonna let anything get to me today.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9967","Woman","I just got a call from the florist. The flowers won't be here till halfway through the ceremony.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9968","Lily","I'm okay.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9969","Man","I hate to bother you, but... I think I found your veil in the parking lot.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9970","Lily","I'm fine.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9971","Andrea","Just FYI  my water broke. But I can probably......make it through.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9972","Lily","Totally cool.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9973","Robin","Oh, no. Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9974","Lily","Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9975","Robin","Are you sure?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9976","Lily","I'm marrying Marshall today. So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil in a room that has no flowers to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning, as my high school boyfriend reads Guns N' Roses lyrics. But that's okay, because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9977","Robin","Lily, are you okay?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9978","Lily","What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay! Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has! It's ruined!","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9979","Robin","What happened to ""I don't want a perfect wedding""?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9980","Lily","Oh, grow up, Robin! Of course I want a perfect wedding! Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but... I do. I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9981","Robin","And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9982","Lily","What could you have that could possibly make me feel better? God, I hope Marshall's having a better day than I'm having.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9983","Marshall","Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9984","Ted","What?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9985","Barney","Well, it's not too short.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9986","Marshall","My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9987","Barney","You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9988","Ted","The good Backstreet Boys?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9989","Marshall","Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?!","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9990","Ted","What-what the hell happened to you?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9991","Marshall","Lily's cousin is in beauty school, and Lily didn't want her to do her hair, so she said she could do mine.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9992","Marshall","So, um, just not-not too short, okay?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9993","Cousin","Oh, no, we don't even have to cut it at all. Could just give it some style.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9994","Marshall","Oh, okay, yeah, that's great. 'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird. And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9995","Cousin","Ooh, I could give you some cool guy tips.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9996","Marshall","I don't think I need advice on how to be cool, but yeah, great, lay that on me.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9997","Marshall","I can't get married like this! There's no way!","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9998","Barney","Ah, let me see what I can do.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"9999","Ted","What? What can you do?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10000","Barney","I have a superpower.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10001","Marshall","Lily is gonna kill me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10002","Ted","That's crazy. Of course she will.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10003","Marshall","Would you marry me?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10004","Ted","No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule  never marry anyone you've had a farting contest with.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10005","Marshall","Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10006","Barney","Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10007","Ted","Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10008","Marshall","Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?!","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10009","Ted","What?!","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10010","Marshall","You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10011","Ted","Dude, those guys are criminals.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10012","Marshall","Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something!","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10013","Ted","Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10014","Marshall","No!","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10015","Ted","Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10016","Ben","Yes.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10017","Ted","Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10018","Ben","Yeah.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10019","Ted","Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10020","Ben","Oh, no!","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10021","Ted","Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10022","Ben","Yeah, that would probably work, but with what? That's a tough one.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10023","Ted","Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10024","Ben","Mm, yeah. Does anyone here wear a toupee? (Ben's wearing a toupee) Shouldn't be hard to find out. Most of them are pretty bad.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10025","Ted","That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10026","Ben","Boy, that's a pretty tall order.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10027","Ted","Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10028","Ben","No, not off the top of my... No. Can't.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10029","Ted","Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10030","Barney","The bride needs this.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10031","Marshall","Actually, I think it kinda works.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10032","Ted","It totally does.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10033","Marshall","Barney?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10034","Barney","To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10035","Marshall","Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10036","Ted","It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10037","Marshall","Oh, you know...","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10038","Ted","In a bad way.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10039","Brad","Hey. Cool hair, bro.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10040","Ted","What happened to your shirt?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10041","Brad","I got sauce on it when I tackled the caterer.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10042","Ted","You gonna put another shirt on?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10043","Brad","No, I'm good. Hey, you guys seen Scooter?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10044","Marshall","What? What? Scooter's here? That guy's at my wedding?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10045","Brad","Not for long, bro. Not for long.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10046","Marshall","Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10047","Barney","It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10048","Ted","Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10049","Marshall","Oh, no.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10050","Lily","Oh, my God! Marshall...","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10051","Marshall","Lily, you're not supposed to see me.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10052","Robin","Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10053","Lily","What happened? Did Amy do this to you?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10054","Marshall","Just the frosted tips. I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby. I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10055","Lily","Oh, no, you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie. It was already ruined. There's no flowers, no photographer. Oh, and Scooter's here, by the way.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10056","Marshall","Yeah, I know. I heard.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10057","Lily","My veil got thrashed, the harp player is in labor, and I'm not wearing my wedding underwear.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10058","Marshall","What? No ""Property of Marshall"" across the back? How are people going to know whose butt that is?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10059","Lily","What happened? Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10060","Marshall","I wish we could have that wedding.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10061","Ted","So do it.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10062","Marshall","What?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10063","Ted","Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10064","Barney","Yes. Yes, I can. Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something  your jaws-- because Barney Stinson is about to aid and abet a marriage.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10065","Marshall","Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10066","Robin","Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10067","Marshall","What do you think, baby?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10068","Lily","I love it.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10069","Marshall","Me, too. Let's do it. Let's get married before we get married.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10070","Lily","Great. Wait, hold on. Excuse me, sir. Could we borrow your hat?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10071","Man","Okay.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10072","Lily","Thank you.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10073","Marshall","Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10074","Barney","Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10075","Robin","He's gonna cry.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10076","Barney","No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10077","Marshall","Oh, no. I don't have my vows.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10078","Lily","I don't have mine either.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10079","Ted","You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10080","Marshall","Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick. You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called ""Eggs Marshall,"" and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10081","Ted","No problem.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10082","Barney","It's totally okay.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10083","Lily","My turn. Oh, thank you. Marshall, I love you because you're funny and you make me feel loved and you make me feel safe and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says, ""Lily and Marshall. Rockin' It Since '96."" I kinda wish I was wearing it right now 'cause it smells like you. But the main reason I love you, Marshall Ericksen, is you make me happy. You make me happy all the time.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10084","Robin","Hey, I found your panties!","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10085","Lily","I'm good.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10086","Barney","Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10087","Lily","Slow down.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10088","Barney","I can't From this day forward so as long as you both shall live?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10089","Marshall","I do.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10090","Barney","Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to be your husband to have and to hold... live?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10091","Lily","I do.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10092","Barney","Okay, then, by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10093","Marshall","Did you smoke?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10094","Lily","No.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10095","Robin","Wow. First lie of marriage. That was fast.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10096","Ted (2030)","After that, we all went back inside for the second wedding. And yes, a lot of things did go wrong, but it didn't matter because when I look back on that day, what I remember is the first wedding; the intimate outdoor ceremony with just close friends and an acoustic guitar.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10097","Marshall","How do you feel?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10098","Lily","Tired. I got married twice today.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10099","Marshall","So where do you want to do it for the first time as a married couple, nice hotel room or a reception hall bathroom?","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10100","Lily","What do you think? Bathroom, of course.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10101","Ted","Please don't.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10102","Marshall and Lily","Sorry, Ted.","02","21","Something Borrowed"
"10103","Man","Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever Mr. and Marshall Eriksen and Lily Aldrin.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10104","Lily","Does it make you kind of sad that we don't share the same last name?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10105","Marshall","You know, in a totally evolved 21st-century kind of way yeah, a little.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10106","Lily","You know what we should do? We should come up with a whole new last name.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10107","Marshall","Oh, that's easy-- Lily and Marshall Skywalker.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10108","Lily","Lily and Marshall Hasselhoff.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10109","Marshall","I got it. You ready? You ready?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10110","Lily","Yeah.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10111","Marshall","Lily and Marshall Awesome. Have you met the Awesomes? Marshall, Lily, their son, Totally and their daughter, Freakin'?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10112","Lily","I love you, Mr. Awesome.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10113","Marshall","I love you, Mrs. Awesome.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10114","Ted","So...","02","22","Something Blue"
"10115","Robin","So...","02","22","Something Blue"
"10116","Ted","Wedding's over.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10117","Robin","Yes, it is.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10118","Ted","I guess starting tomorrow, we can tell people.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10119","Barney","Tell people what?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10120","Robin","Hi, Barney.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10121","Barney","Tell people what?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10122","Ted","The food looks delicious, doesn't it?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10123","Barney","Tell people what?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10124","Robin","Nothing.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10125","Barney","Oh, okay. Tell people what?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10126","Ted","Can we talk about this later?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10127","Barney","Absolutely. Tell people what?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10128","Robin","Hi. Have you met Barney?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10129","Barney","Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10130","Ted","Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10131","Barney","Okay. (Barney leaves)","02","22","Something Blue"
"10132","Ted","Whoo, that was a close one.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10133","Robin","Think he'll actually let it go?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10134","Robin","Can I get a water please?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10135","Barney","Tell people what?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10136","Robin","Oh, God! Okay. Look, we have some... news.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10137","Ted","But we don't want to draw attention away from Lily and Marshall's big day.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10138","Robin","So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10139","Barney","Fine.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10140","Ted","It's pretty big, though.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10141","Barney","Oh, my God, just tell me!","02","22","Something Blue"
"10142","Lily","Oh, help us.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10143","Robin","What's wrong?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10144","Lily","We're starving. We planned this amazing meal with the caterers, and we haven't had a bite of it.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10145","Marshall","Every time we get near the food, we get cocktail weiner blocked. We haven't eaten all day.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10146","Robin","All right, let's run some interference.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10147","Ted","Yeah, we'll get you back to your table. Come on.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10148","Lily's grandma","Oh, there you are. My dear, you look so beautiful.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10149","Lily","Thanks, Grammie, but we really need to...","02","22","Something Blue"
"10150","Lily's grandma","And you... you look like a 1940s movie star.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10151","Marshall","And you look like a pepper-crusted rack of lamb with mint jelly.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10152","Robin","All right, let's get these two back to their table.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10153","Lily's grandma","We will see you on the floor for the conga line later, won't we?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10154","Ted(2030)","The answer to that one was decided weeks earlier.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10155","Robin","Conga line.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10156","Lily","Oh, yes, definitely.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10157","Ted","How about a slide show of you guys through the years set to Green Day's ""Time of Your Life"" and ending with your baby photos side by side.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10158","Lily","Oh, that's great. Going on the list.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10159","Barney","What list?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10160","Lily","Horrible wedding clichées we're not going to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10161","Barney","Oh, like First Corinthians? That Bible verse? They do that at every wedding.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10162","Robin","How's it go?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10163","Marshall","""Love is patient and kind. ""Love does not envy or boast. ""It is not arrogant or rude. ""Love does not insist on it's own way. ""It is not irritable or resentful. ""Love bears all things, ""believes all things, ""hopes all things... ""endures all things.""","02","22","Something Blue"
"10164","Robin","Lame.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10165","Lily","Going on the list.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10166","Lily","We've done it. A wedding with zero clichées.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10167","Ted","Wait, isn't doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a clichée?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10168","Lily","Well, okay, one clichée.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10169","Marshall","Well, technically two.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10170","Lily","No! They cleared our plates again!","02","22","Something Blue"
"10171","Marshall","Pepper-crusted rack of lamb, where did you go? It's my wedding night. I was supposed to have my way with you.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10172","Lily","Well, you still have me.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10173","Marshall","Yeah...","02","22","Something Blue"
"10174","Barney","Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something, so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10175","Lily","No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well...","02","22","Something Blue"
"10176","Barney","Are those mini quiches? (Marshall and Lily run) Tell the secret.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10177","Ted","Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10178","Barney","Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10179","Ted","What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10180","Barney","Maybe in your life-- I got a lot of stuff going on.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10181","Robin","Okay, so we're sitting there and the waiter comes over...","02","22","Something Blue"
"10182","Waiter","Champagne?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10183","Robin","Um, we didn't order champagne.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10184","Waiter","Compliments of the house.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10185","Ted","Wow. Thanks. Cheers.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10186","Robin (voive over)","And there, sitting at the bottom of my champagne glass is...","02","22","Something Blue"
"10187","Lily","Mini quiche. You're a mega-douche.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10188","Barney","Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away.(Lily and Marshall leave) So what was in the glass?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10189","Ted","Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, ""Champagne?"" ""We didn't order any champagne."" ""Compliments of the house."" ""Wow.""","02","22","Something Blue"
"10190","Barney","You said that already!","02","22","Something Blue"
"10191","Ted (voice over)","Right. So Robin looks down, and there at the bottom of her glass...","02","22","Something Blue"
"10192","Robin","Is an engagement ring.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10193","Man( with a camera)","Anything you want to say to the bride and groom?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10194","Barney","Don't get married.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10195","Man","Why don't I come back.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10196","Barney","An engagement ring?No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do","02","22","Something Blue"
"10197","Ted","That's what she said.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10198","Robin","No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10199","Ted","What are you talking about?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10200","Robin","This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10201","Ted","That's not mine.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10202","Robin","What?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10203","Ted","That's not mine.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10204","Robin","Then whose is it?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10205","Man","It's mine. Janna... will you marry me?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10206","Janna","Yes.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10207","Robin","Wow. That was hilarious. I was like... what? Anyway.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10208","Ted","What the hell was that?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10209","Robin","What the hell was what?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10210","Ted","That reaction?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10211","Robin","I thought you were proposing to me.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10212","Ted","Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10213","Robin","Ted, you know how I feel about marriage.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10214","Ted","Now more than ever.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10215","Robin","I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10216","Ted","No.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10217","Robin","Then why is this an issue?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10218","Ted","Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, ""No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. ""Ted, you cannot do this to me. ""No. No, no, no.""","02","22","Something Blue"
"10219","Robin","Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10220","Ted","No.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10221","Marshall","Hey, Stinson. Never lie to a man about a chocolate fountain.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10222","Robin","So did you guys find anything to eat?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10223","Lily","I had four strawberries.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10224","Ted","Was there a side of champagne with each of the strawberries?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10225","Lily (burping)","Yes.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10226","Marshall","Lily, you could have burped or said the word ""Yes,"" but the fact that you did both is exactly why I married you.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10227","Lily","Oh, look, more strawberries!","02","22","Something Blue"
"10228","Barney","So what happened next?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10229","Robin","Ted, don't do this.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10230","Ted","No, seriously. Where do you see yourself in five years?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10231","Robin","Where do you see yourself?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10232","Ted","Honestly, in five years... I probably want to be married.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10233","Robin","And I probably want to be in Argentina.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10234","Ted","Argentina?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10235","Robin","Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10236","Ted","We have an expiration date, don't we?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10237","Barney","Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10238","Ted","Barney... story's not over.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10239","Robin","Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10240","Ted","Yeah, of course. Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this. Can we actually...","02","22","Something Blue"
"10241","Waiter","Oh, my God, it's you.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10242","Ted","Wha... what?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10243","Waiter","You're the son of a bitch who stole our blue French horn.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10244","Ted","Run!","02","22","Something Blue"
"10245","Barney","Run? Your strategy was run?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10246","Ted","It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10247","Robin","Yeah? And how did that work out for you?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10248","Ted","I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license till we bring the horn back.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10249","Robin","Well, come on, Ted, can you blame them?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10250","Ted","Look, I'm sorry about the French horn. I want to make this right. So what we're going to do right now is, we're going to run!","02","22","Something Blue"
"10251","Ted","So... Argentina.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10252","Robin","Argentina.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10253","Ted","Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10254","Robin","Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10255","Ted","I could want to live in Argentina.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10256","Robin","No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10257","Ted","Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too. They have buildings in Argentina. And Paris. And even Tokyo. I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10258","Robin","So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10259","Ted","Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10260","Robin","Oh, shut up.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10261","Ted","You're scared I might not be kidding.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10262","Robin","Aren't you?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10263","Ted","Nope. Your move, Scherbatsky.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10264","Robin","Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10265","Barney","No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina. The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years, the government is opposed to free market reforms, and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium. Man, she was chatty.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10266","Robin","Right? Right?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10267","Barney","You caught the bouquet?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10268","Ted","Barney. The story's not over yet.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10269","Robin","Wait, wait, wait, wait.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10270","Ted","What?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10271","Robin","I don't know if I can do this to you.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10272","Ted","Do what?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10273","Robin","Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10274","Ted","Oh, right. 'Cause there are no kids there. On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black ""X"" over Argentina.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10275","Robin","You know what I mean.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10276","Ted","No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10277","Robin","Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10278","Barney","That's when you run. Tell me you ran, Ted.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10279","Robin","Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to start having babies right this second. Do you have a...?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10280","Robin","Well, we probably shouldn't.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10281","Ted","Yeah.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10282","Robin","Risk it?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10283","Ted","Risk it.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10284","Barney","No.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10285","Man","All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're all gather around, Lily and Marshall are going to cut the cake.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10286","Barney","No. Robin, you're not... No, say the story's not over.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10287","Robin","Come on, they're cutting the cake.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10288","Barney","Say the story's not over! Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried I've ever been that someone's pregnant.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10289","Marshall","Okay, Lily. I'm really hungry, so let's just, uh, aim for my mouth, okay? Besides, the smearing the cake thing's a clichée, remember?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10290","Lily","No, it's going to be so funny.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10291","Marshall","Lily. Lily, just feed me the cake. Please, baby, I am so hungry. (Lily's so drunk that she falls)","02","22","Something Blue"
"10292","Lily","Whoopsy-daisy.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10293","Marshall","And she's okay. She's all right. That was funny. And it's time for the honeymoon. Guys, guys, guys. Thank you so much.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10294","Lily","We love you. I love you.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10295","Barney","Getting married, having kids. It's all a mistake. It's a horrible, horrible mistake.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10296","Man","God, this guy's giving me nothing.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10297","Ted","All right, have fun in Scotland. If you see the Loch Ness Monster, tell him Ted Mosby says, ""What's up?""","02","22","Something Blue"
"10298","Marshall","Nessie's a she, Ted, come on. Marshall and Lily leave.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10299","Ted","Hey, kiddo.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10300","Ted","The story's not over, Barney.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10301","Ted","Okay, time to get the horn back to the bistro.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10302","Robin","Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again. That tuckered me out.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10303","Ted","Not a euphemism.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10304","Robin","Right. Okay, let me just go change, and we'll leave.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10305","Ted","Whoa, whoa, you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh. Solidarity, sister.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10306","Robin","That is crazy. I have a change of clothes and you don't. Suck it up.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10307","Ted","Well, if we'd actually moved in together, all my stuff would be here, but we didn't, so...","02","22","Something Blue"
"10308","Robin","Yeah. We were all talk, weren't we?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10309","Ted","We're not doing this, are we?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10310","Robin","I don't want to have kids in Argentina.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10311","Ted","And I don't want to have kids in Argentina.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10312","Robin","So where does that leave us?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10313","Ted","Well... we could stay together and... pretend this stuff doesn't matter. Or... we could give back the blue French horn.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10314","Robin","You stole a blue French horn for me.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10315","Ted","I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10316","Barney","You did break up.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10317","Ted","Yep.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10318","Barney","You're not pregnant?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10319","Robin","Nope.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10320","Barney","An-And Marshall and Lily don't know?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10321","Ted","Well, afterwards, uh, we came by to tell you guys, but Lily was pretty stressed out, so...","02","22","Something Blue"
"10322","Robin","We decided not to say anything till after the wedding.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10323","Barney","You guys okay?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10324","Ted","Well, it hasn't been the easiest two weeks of our lives, but...","02","22","Something Blue"
"10325","Robin","But we're okay.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10326","Ted","The open bar helps.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10327","Kid","Excuse me, Miss.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10328","Robin","Hi.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10329","Kid","Could I have this dance?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10330","Ted","Well, we knew this day would come eventually. Take care of her, little man.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10331","Marshall","This is by far the drunkest I've ever seen you. Uh, driver.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10332","Ranjit","Hello!","02","22","Something Blue"
"10333","Marshall","Ranjit!! Hey, can we make a stop before we head back to the hotel?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10334","Ranjit","You do not have to stop. You can be together as man and wife right back there, and because we are friends... I will not watch.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10335","Marshall","Um, no, we actually had something else in mind.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10336","Ranjit","Okay.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10337","Marshall","Lily, go sit down.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10338","Man","Welcome to Wienerburger.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10339","Marshall","Hi. Can we get a number one, please, with no pickles? And a number four with no onions.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10340","Man","Let me guess. Jefferson High prom?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10341","Marshall","No. But thank you. Actually, we just got married.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10342","Man","Wow. Congratulations.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10343","Marshall","Thank you.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10344","Man","That's $7.80. Hey, dude.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10345","Marshall","Yeah.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10346","Man","I don't know how to say this, but your wife just threw up in the trash.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10347","Marshall","My wife...","02","22","Something Blue"
"10348","Ted (2030)","So Marshall and Lily were married, and Robin and I were broken up. And as hard as it was at the time, in the end we both got what we wanted. She did eventually go on to live in Argentina and Morocco and Greece, Russia, even Japan for a little while. And I... well, I met your mom. I think for the most part if you're really honest with yourself about what you want out of life, Of course, at that moment, all I really wanted was a scotch and soda and a cigar.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10349","Barney","I'm really sorry about you and Robin. I know I was always joking around about wanting you two to break up, but you were really good together.","02","22","Something Blue"
"10350","Ted","Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10351","Barney","The one. Oh, Ted, no. Do not tell me you're going to start searching for ""the one"" again. The only time I want to hear you saying ""the one"" is if it's followed by the word ""hundredth."" What up?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10352","Ted","No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know?","02","22","Something Blue"
"10353","Barney","Really? 'Cause... you know, you've been in a relationship for a year. You're going to... be a little rusty.","02","22","Something Blue"

"10381","Lily","What do you mean ""Win the breakup"", old timey inventor.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10382","Marshall","What our 21st president, Chester A. Arthur, is trying to say is that in every breakup there are winners and losers.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10383","Lily","It's not a competition. Now, your 80-day ballon race around the world, that was a competition.","03","01","Wait for It"

"10397","Ted","And, oh, he is a masseuse.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10398","Gael","With a massage everything is connected. I can touch your foot cleanse your kidney. I can touch your earlobe and slow your heartbeat.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10399","Ted","One time I used warm water to make a guy pee. Of course, I didn't make a career out of it.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10400","Gael","Career? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10401","Barney","How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me.","03","01","Wait for It"

"10403","Lily","How do you know?","03","01","Wait for It"
"10404","Barney","Glad you asked Lily. I have crafted a list of every vehicle land-based, aquatic and airborne in which/on which it's possible to have s*x. And of those 33 vehicles, I have had s*x in/on 31. Windsurfing board, not on the list, not possible. Oh, P.S., in order to hit 33, all I need is bobsled and the Apollo 11 space capsule.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10405","Lily","To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian.","03","01","Wait for It"

"10412","Lily","Do you want to have diner with me? Uh, us?","03","01","Wait for It"
"10413","Marshall","There was no lull. You just think he's incredibly hot.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10414","Lily","No, I don't!...Not incredibly. It's a little hard to believe how hot is he. But I mean, she isn't serious about him. The girl never marries the hot guy.","03","01","Wait for It"

"10459","Marshall","Lily, we are Ted's best friends. Our job is to hate that guy.","03","01","Wait for It"

"10461","Marshall","Weren't you wearing a bra?","03","01","Wait for It"
"10462","Narrator","The night was doing great. Amy was cool and dangerous. She found a friend for Barney. She even paid for drinks... (Amy steals liquor from behind the bar) sort of.","03","01","Wait for It"

"10558","Ted","Good. Now, here's the thing. It sucks that you came back from Argentina with someone as awesome as Gael. And I know I have no right to be upset at you. We're broken up, life goes on, whatever. But you know what? We-we never did this. We-we had this polite breakup with no irrational yelling and that's just wrong. So I'm gonna yell irrationally for a while and you're just gonna have to stand there and deal with it, okay?","03","01","Wait for It"
"10559","Robin","If you feel like you need to do that, then...","03","01","Wait for It"
"10560","Ted","(yells) I think I do! I really think I do! So now, I'm yelling!","03","01","Wait for It"
"10561","Robin","You shaved.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10562","Ted","(yells) I did.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10563","Robin","I like the beard.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10564","Ted","(still yelling) I liked it too, but it was getting kind of hot. Maybe in the winter, I'll grow it back out! (quietly) Okay, I'm done.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10565","Robin","I know it was weird showing up with Gael. I'm sorry.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10566","Ted","Look, us breaking up, it was the right thing. But it took some time to get over you, you know? I-I'm still getting over you. But you, you were over it the minute they started the in-flight movie.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10567","Robin","Over it? My first three days in Argentina, I cried my eyes out. I missed you so much. I wanted to go and prove how adventurous I am, but the truth is, it was really lonely. And that's why Gael happened.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10568","Ted","You weren't trying to win the break-up?","03","01","Wait for It"
"10569","Robin","I was trying to survive it.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10570","Ted","Okay. No. See, look, that all sounds good, and we'll still be friends and move on, but..., did he have to be so hot? The guy's an Adonis.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10571","Robin","He's not an Adonis.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10572","Ted","He's the Cadillac of rebound guys. Marshall has a crush on him. The guy's perfect.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10573","Robin","He's not perfect.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10574","Ted","Oh, come on. He's hot, he windsurfs, he massages things. Name one way I'm better than that guy.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10575","Robin","""You're bigger"".","03","01","Wait for It"
"10576","Ted","Don't patronize me. If anything, he may even be a little bit taller.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10577","Robin","No, Ted... ""you're bigger"".","03","01","Wait for It"
"10578","Narrtor","Kids, I can't remember exactly what helped me get through the whole Robin-Gael incident. I'm sure it was something profound and meaningful and not at all macho and petty. But after that, I was back on my feet. And what followed was a new era in my life. A crazy time unlike anything that came before. (The camera goes outside to show a sea of black umbrellas, and one yellow one walking through the crowd) It's funny looking back on those days, knowing now exactly what I was heading towards, and what was heading towards me.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10579","Barney","Go for Barney.","03","01","Wait for It"
"10580","Marshall","Hey, man. It's Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something.","03","01","Wait for It"

"10585","Ted","So, beeing married, different? Not different?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10586","Marshall","It's the same. Mostly, except I think I might be getting carpal tunnel. My hands keeps cramping up.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10587","Barney","I think the whole point of getting married was that you didn't have to do that anymore.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10588","Marshall","No, it's from writing all the thank you notes. Mostly.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10589","Lily","Yeah. You're writing constantly. There's forms we have to sign, our death folders, thank you notes...","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10590","Barney","Whoa. Whoa. What are death folders?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10591","Lily","It's this thing they recommend you do in case one spouse died unexpectedly.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10592","Marshall","It's all the information your spouse might need all in one convenient location.","03","02","We're Not from Here"

"10596","Barney","Yeah. Wait, why?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10597","Marshall","I didn't know that I was supposed to write a letter. All Lily's gonna find in that folder are a bunch of bank statements and a funny list of things to do with my ashes.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10598","Ted","Marshall brownies.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10599","Marshall","Number six. Yeah. Oh, God, I am a bad husband. No, uh, no, I'll just write, I'll write Lily a letter tonight, everything'll be fine.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10600","Barney","That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10601","Ted","Yes! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10602","Barney","No way at all. In fact, I dare God to smite down this perfectly healthy...","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10603","Marshall","Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! I get it, okay, you guys know I'm a little superstitious, and you guys are trying to freak me out. Well, guess what? It didn't work. So, there.","03","02","We're Not from Here"

"10693","Lily","How can you open my letter?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10694","Marshall","That was not a letter. It was barely even a text message. Next time you write something that short, at least have the courtesy to make it rhyme.","03","02","We're Not from Here"

""This just in  Look at my hand, how weird is my hand?"" is not an appropriate thing to say on the air. And number three... I... (All cherring).

"10738","Ted","""Thank God, we're alive"" s*x.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10739","Barney","""Thank God we're alive"" s*x. It's even better than ""I can't believe you just proposed to me"" s*x, which I've only had, like, four of five times. Ted, please, we are so close.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10740","Ted","All right. I'm in. I've never worked this hard for anything in my life.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10741","Ted","Whew.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10742","Lindsay","Wow. I think we all need to go back to our place and recover.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10743","Colleen","Yeah. I just want to celebrate the fact that we survived. You know?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10744","Barney","Mmm-mm. Me too. So where do you live?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10745","Ted","What? West village?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10746","Colleen","Close. West Orange.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10747","Ted","West Orange? New Jersey?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10748","Collee","Yeah.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10749","Ted","You guys live in New Jersey, not New York?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10750","Barney","Theodore.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10751","Colleen","Yep.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10752","Ted","New Jersey?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10753","Barney","Teddy?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10754","Colleen","Yeah. But don't worry, it's pretty much New York.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10755","Ted","Oh, no. Oh, no.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10756","Barney","Oh, no.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10757","Ted","New Jersey is not ""pretty much New York"". You are not ""pretty much new yorkers"".","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10758","Colleen","And how would you know?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10759","Ted","Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to ""pretty much New York""? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey!","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10760","Barney","(with an accent) You're not from Missouri? Well, I will be a monkey's unc...","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10761","Colleen","Ew. (To the Policeman) Can we get a ride?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10762","Barney","Hey, um, sir, can we get ride, too?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10763","Policeman","Newark, born and raised.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10764","Robin","Can you please keep it down?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10765","Robin #2","What happened to you, man? You said you wouldn't change, but look at you. No more tan, no more beaded braids, no more lush, untamed forest of leg and armpit hair. You're back at work. What gives?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10766","Robin","Well. I have to have a job.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10767","Robin #2","""I have to have a job"", God, that's so american.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10768","Robin","I'm canadian. You know that.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10769","Robin #2","What about the important things like making your own jewerly and lying on the beach and thinking about peace? God, don't you care about thinking about peace?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10770","Robin","Wow. I just realized something.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10771","Robin #2","That you've lost your way.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10772","Robin","No, that you really suck. You're boring and lame and you're getting sand everywhere. Seriously, where is all the sand coming from? You're not the real me. All you are is me on vacation trying to get away from a break-up.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10773","Robin #2","Don't you remember Argentina?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10774","Robin #2","Don't you want to go back?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10775","Robin","What are you doing?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10776","Robin #2","Shh. Let this happen.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10777","Robin","All right, everyone out! I said everyone out!","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10778","All","All right, we're living, we're leaving, okay. Michael Moore was so right about americans.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10779","Robin","(yelling) I'm canadian!","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10780","Gael","Robin, are you okay?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10781","Robin","No, I'm not. Listen, Gael, I need to talk to you about something.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10782","Narrator","After they broke-up, Robin went back to being Robin.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10783","Barney","Welcome home, Scherbatsky.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10784","Robin","Oh, good to be back. Although it's weird, vacation Robin popped into my dream again last night.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10785","Barney","Listening.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10786","Robin","This time we went all the way. Tell you one thing. She is maybe sandy but that chick knows what I like.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10787","Lily","Okay, I'm done... but I really don't want you reading this unless... you know, something happens. Can you swear to me you won't open it?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10788","Marshall","Totally. What does it say?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10789","Lily","Marshall, I'm serious.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10790","Marshall","Okay. I promise I won't, I won't open that until you're dead.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10791","Lily","Okay.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10792","Narrator","And through 22 wonderful years of marriage, Marshall kept his promise.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10793","Narrator","Until November 1 of last year when, sadly...","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10794","Lily (voiceover)","""Busted! I knew you'd read this. You suck, Marshall, you totally suck.""","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10795","Marshall","That's it? I suck. Lily.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10796","Lily","Yes, you suck. You said you wouldn't read it and you did.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10797","Marshall","Well, you didn't keep your promise either. I don't see any dirty pictures in here.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10798","Lily","Oh, fine, I'll take the dirty pictures.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10799","Marshall","I don't want 'em now.","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10800","Lily","What is that supposed to mean?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10801","Marshall","What?! Nothing. Nothing. You're beautiful. I would love the photos. Have I told you how beautiful you look?","03","02","We're Not from Here"
"10802","Future Ted","Kids, I know you think that you've heard every story from back before I met your mother. But there are some stories you tell and some stories you don't.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10803","Ted","Oh my God. Barney...oh my God.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10804","Barney","Use your words, Ted.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10805","Ted","OK. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10806","Barney","The belt?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10807","Ted","The belt.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10808","Barney","But that's impossible. You were up here less than half an hour ago.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10809","Marshall","Yes, advantage Ericksen.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10810","Barney","Don't get cocky. Wimbledon lasts a fortnight.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10811","Marshall","Fortnight. British words are so cool. Plus, did you know lawyers there get to wear wigs? I wear a wig to work, I'm a jackass.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10812","Ted","All right, I'm ready, let's hit it.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10813","Marshall","Can't go. Tournament.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10814","Ted","What? We agreed, I suited up.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10815","Barney","You take too long to get ready","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10816","Ted","What are you talking about? I got the low-maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10817","Marshall","Yeah, which takes an hour and a half of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10818","Barney","And then he starts on his hair. Ace.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10819","Ted","Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10820","Barney","Just go without us, we'll be there in five minutes.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10821","Ted","Really?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10822","Barney, Marshall","Yes.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10823","Ted","All right, going down to the bar and ordering three beers, I'll see you in five minutes.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10824","Ted","(holding up appropriate number of fingers) 3 beers, 5 minutes.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10825","Robin","Thanks for lending me these boots. Where did you get them from?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10826","Lily","Oh, this store in the Village had one of those crazy sales. It was a footwear feeding frenzy.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10827","Lily","I saw it first.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10828","Lily","You just made the list, bitch.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10829","Barney","So many questions. Firstly, what do you think would happen if a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10830","Lily","You look fantastic in them, Robin. But don't you think they're a little high for that dress?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10831","Robin","Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've begun a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10832","Barney","FYI, it doesn't matter, baby. Guys just wanna get on the green. They don't mind going through the rough.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10833","Marshall","Shekwakie.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10834","Barney","Stinson.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10835","Ted","All right, the beers are here.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10836","Barney","Yeah, we're not gonna make it.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10837","Ted","Oh come on, we agreed...Did Marshall take his pants off?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10838","Barney","Yeah, pants are off.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10839","Marshall","This is Wimbledon, Ted. I need the freedom and mobility that only underwear can provide. Cheerio.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10840","Ted","Fine, I don't need friends. I got you guys. You guys are my friends, my cold refreshing friends. I'm talking to beer.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10841","Trudy","Ted.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10842","Trudy","Trudy.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10843","Ted","Trudy. Oh my God, I haven't seen you since...","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10844","Trudy","I slept with you, then climbed down the fire escape?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10845","Ted","That was you? Kidding. I was super wasted... that night. These are not all for me.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10846","Ted","No, I was gonna call you but I was so embarrassed.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10847","Trudy","You were embarrassed? I was like, I really like this guy and now I'm climbing out his window.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10848","Trudy","And I forgot my underwear.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10849","Ted","Those were yours? I thought they felt kinda tight. Kidding, I don't wear underwear, ladies underwear. Often. Again, I'm kidding.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10850","Trudy","I am so glad I ran into you.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10851","Ted","I know, do you wanna get a...","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10852","Rachel","Trudy, no way!","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10853","Trudy","Oh my God, Rachel, how are you?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10854","Trudy","Ted, this is Rachel.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10855","Rachel","Hi.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10856","Rachel, Trudy","Kappa Epsilon Gamma! Whoo!","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10857","Ted","Let me guess, you guys met in prison.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10858","Rachel","No, we're sorority sisters.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10859","Trudy","And best friends forever, all sophomore year.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10860","Rachel","When we weren't at each other's throats.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10861","Trudy","We could be so competitive. But that's all behind us now.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10862","Rachel","(singing and dancing) Hey, mista...","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10863","Rachel, Trudy","(Trudy joins in singing and dancing)... hey mista, stay away from my sista.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10864","Trudy","We have so much catching up do to.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10865","Rachel","OK, are you going to Stacy's wedding?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10866","Trudy","Oh, it's off, apparently he's into dudes.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10867","Rachel","No! Again? That's like her third one.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10868","Trudy","I know.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10869","Ted","Well, beers, what do you want to do? Stay here, or I know this other place called my belly.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10870","Rachel","So, Trudy and I got a table.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10871","Ted","Oh, that's cool, I was gonna get outta here anyway, I'm really tired.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10872","Rachel","But I want you to stay.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10873","Ted","Tired of people who fold early 'cause I am wide awake.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10874","Ted","OK, guys, be cool.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10875","Marshall","Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10876","Barney","That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10877","Barney","Stinson.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10878","Ted","I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10879","Barney","You mean, the girl who chalked your pool cue and snuck down the fire escape.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10880","Ted","So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10881","Barney","So you now have two on the line?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10882","Ted","And I don't know which one to go for.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10883","Barney","Go for the new girl.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10884","Barney","Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10885","Lily","New girl? What new girl?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10886","Barney","Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections and I think...","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10887","Lily","Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. Give it to me.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10888","Lily","Are they friends? (Ted on phone)","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10889","Ted","Yeah. No, I don't know. They're old sorority sisters.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10890","Lily","Are they Betas?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10891","Lily","Because they're all sluts and you can tell them right now I didn't wanna be in their sorority anyway.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10892","Ted","They're Kappas and I think I can score with one of them. I don't know which one and if I choose wrong, I lose 'em both.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10893","Lily","OK, well, don't worry, I'll come down and help you figure it out.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10894","Marshall","I thought we were in for the evening.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10895","Barney","That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there but I guess we're both wrong, governor.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10896","Trudy","Oh, Ted, OK, settle an argument. Is it stealing if you go out with someone's boyfriend after they've broken up?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10897","Ted","Well, that's very complicated.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10898","Rachel","See, he agrees with me. You're such a little man-thief.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10899","Trudy","You're the man-thief, man-thief.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10900","Ted","Oh, somebody should lock you girls up.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10901","Trudy","You're so funny. I think Ted is funny.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10902","Rachel","Really? I think Ted is hilarious.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10903","Ted","(muttering to himself) I am never not wearing a suit again.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10904","Ted","Hello.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10905","Lily","It's me, I'm at the bar. Don't look, just call me mom.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10906","Ted","Hi Mom, how's dad's colon?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10907","Lily","What? What's the matter with you? Anyway, both of these girls are into you. Take your pick.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10908","Ted","They are? Are you sure?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10909","Lily","Yes, of course. They're playing with their hair and touching your arm. Class green light.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10910","Ted","Are you positive?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10911","Robin","That is so fascinating. So what happened?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10912","Robin's date","Well, after eighteen hours of surgery, I closed and thankfully both girls just celebrated their second birthday.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10913","Robin","Wow, gosh, separating conjoined twins. That must be the most amazing feeling.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10914","Robin's date","True, but now the parents don't know what to do with their huge supply of four-legged overalls.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10915","Robin","That is so funny. You are so funny.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10916","Lily","Positive. They both want you bad. It's a clearance sale and you're the boots, baby.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10917","Lily","Oh, it's Robin. Good luck.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10918","Ted","Bye mom.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10919","Ted","My mom.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10920","Lily","Hello.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10921","Robin","Bring me a razor.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10922","Lily","What about the no-shave rule? What happened to your convictions?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10923","Robin","They've been surgically removed by Dr. Awesome.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10924","Lily","No, I'm not doing it. The whole point to not shaving...","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10925","Robin","Lily, please, he's really cute and I really like him. And he's got a British accent.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10926","Lily","I'm on my way.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10927","Ted","So, this college boyfriend, who, who won him?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10928","Trudy","Neither of us.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10929","Rachel","He left, junior year abroad.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10930","Trudy","It's really too bad. There was that one thing we wanted to do.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10931","Rachel","We were gonna do, but never did.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10932","Ted","What? What, what were you guys gonna do but never did.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10933","Rachel","No, It's too embarrassing. You tell him.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10934","Trudy","No, you tell him.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10935","Rachel","I don't care if you don't care.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10936","Trudy","I don't care.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10937","Ted","Nobody cares, just say it.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10938","Rachel","Why don't we tell him together?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10939","Trudy","OK, on three.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10940","Trudy","One.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10941","Lily","Well, he's right, it's a dead heat.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10942","Trudy","Two.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10943","Lily","Neither one is giving ground. I could not tell who was the third wheel.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10944","Trudy","Three","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10945","Ted","It's a tricycle.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10946","Barney","No way, no way, no way!","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10947","Marshall","What's happening?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10948","Ted","It's a tricycle.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10949","Marshall","No way, no way, no way. It's a tricycle.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10950","Lily","Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10951","Barney","Put him on speaker.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10952","Barney","So what you're saying to us right now is you have a shot at the belt?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10953","Marshall","Wait wait wait, what belt?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10954","Ted","Barney and I have this running joke that the first guy to actually pull this off would win the championship belt.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10955","Marshall","Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt, right?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10956","Ted","You actually bought a belt.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10957","Barney","That's right, it's resplendent.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10958","Ted","It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10959","Barney","I never kid. Remember you said if I ever slept with that girl from Days of our Lives, I'd be the king? Well...","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10960","Marshall","Why wasn't I told about the belt? I could go for the belt.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10961","Marshall","If Lily were to die before me, then I could ride the tricycle.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10962","Lily","If I died, I'd just come back and haunt your pen1s.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10963","Ted","Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10964","Barney","All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10965","Ted","Yes.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10966","Barney","Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10967","Ted","Yes.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10968","Barney","Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10969","Ted","What? No.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10970","Barney","Ted?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10971","Ted","No. Look, I gotta go. They're gonna think I inherited my dad's imaginary bathroom issues.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10972","Ted","Oh, are you guys leaving?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10973","Rachel","Well, it is getting pretty late.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10974","Ted","Right, well...","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10975","Trudy","I thought maybe we could all go and listen to that Wilco CD you talked about before.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10976","Ted","Great, I have it right upstairs. It's in my apartment upstairs. Let's so upstairs.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10977","Rachel","I'm sorry, where was your apartment again?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10978","Ted","That's funny. I love that. You should tell more jokes at my apartment upstairs.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10979","Marshall","Scenario number 12. We're in a horrific car crash, you die, I'm left paralyzed. Two sexy nurses with a six-pack of wine coolers sneak into my room late at night. I try to blink at them in morse code, ""Please, don't, I love my dead wife,"" but they're medical professionals and I gotta think somehow they're saving my life.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10980","Lily","Fine, sleep with your nurses. Tonight you ride the unicycle.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10981","Marshall","I already did this morning.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10982","Lily","Hello.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10983","Robin","Lily, I have pounded three cappuccinos waiting for you. Pretty soon I won't have to shave, the hair is going to vibrate off my legs.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10984","Lily","Sorry, I can't leave now.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10985","Robin","Lily, he can't see my legs like this. I look like a Turkish lesbian","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10986","Robin","There is a pharmacy across the street. Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10987","Waitress","No, but fifty will.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10988","Barney","Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me. (reading text) We're combing upsars.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10989","Marshall","We're combing upsars? What does that mean?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10990","Lily","He's coming upstairs!","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10991","Marshall","Where are my pants? Where's my pants!","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10992","Ted","Got 'em.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10993","Rachel","Ooh, nice place!","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10994","Rachel","Hey, are these your roommates?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10995","Ted","Yes, yes, but they are not here. They are somewhere else. We have total privacy because privacy is essential when you're listening to music.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10996","Rachel","You know what else is essential when you're listening to music? Music.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10997","Ted","That's hilarious. You are hilarious. I'll go get it in my bedroom. The CD's in my bedroom. Bedroom.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10998","Rachel","OK, we'll try and stay out of trouble.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"10999","Trudy","Of course we can't promise anything.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11000","Ted","This is gonna be awesome.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11001","Ted","No!","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11002","Ted","What are you guys doing here? I've got, I've got...","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11003","Lily","We know, we know, Ted. Well done, this is very impressive. Up top.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11004","Marshall","Yeah bro, up top.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11005","Lily","Oh, don't be gross.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11006","Ted","You guys need to get out of here right now. Please, take the fire escape.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11007","Marshall","No, no way. The other day I saw a pigeon take a crap on it and the whole thing shifted.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11008","Lily","Oh, you can use our bedroom.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11009","Ted","OK, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD...Barney.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11010","Ted","What are you doing?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11011","Barney","I cannot allow Ted to do this.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11012","Ted","Why, why?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11013","Barney","Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11014","Marshall","But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11015","Barney","I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11016","Barney","So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11017","Blonde Girl","Oh my God. My new carpet. Oh my God, this is a disaster, You get the carpet cleaner, I'll get a towel.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11018","Brunette Girl","OK.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11019","Barney","I'll get the video camera.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11020","Blonde Girl","Get out!","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11021","Barney","OK then.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11022","Ted","Let me get this straight. You're gonna trike block me? That is so petty. It's like you're...","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11023","Marshall","Tom Petty.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11024","Ted","Tom Petty. You're Tom Petty.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11025","Ted","Where's Lily?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11026","Ted","Still looking for that CD, so...","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11027","Ted","What are you doing?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11028","Lily","I knew it. I had a hunch about that girl and I was right.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11029","Lily","I saw it first.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11030","Lily","You just made the list, bitch.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11031","Lily","I cannot give up my bedroom to a boot thief. She should be punished, not rewarded.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11032","Ted","Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11033","Lily","No, never.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11034","Ted","What if I reimburse you for the boots, full retail?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11035","Lily","Thanks, enjoy our bedroom.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11036","Ted","OK, take it.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11037","Ted","Wish me luck.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11038","Barney","Oh my God.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11039","Robin","Where's the shaving cream?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11040","Waitress","Well, you didn't ask me for shaving cream.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11041","Robin","Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11042","Waitress","Well, who doesn't shave their legs for her date?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11043","Robin","Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11044","Waitress","Well, here's a little tip for you. Shave your legs before you leave the house, Sasquatch.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11045","Robin's date","Hey Robin, the valet's brought the car around. I thought we'd go back to my place. You in the mood for a night cap?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11046","Robin","Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies room. I've got TB...tiny bladder. I'll meet you out front?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11047","Robin's date","Yeah.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11048","Robin","You've gotta be kidding me.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11049","Robin","Excuse me.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11050","Ted","So, I'm having a little trouble finding the CD.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11051","Rachel","That's OK, we don't need music to have fun.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11052","Ted","Exactly.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11053","Trudy","You do like to have fun, don't you Ted?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11054","Ted","It's getting late, I'll get your coats.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11055","Lily","I'll get your coats? Ted  I don't know why I said that. Why did I say that? It's the opposite of what I meant. I wanna take clothes off them, not put more on.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11056","Marshall","Ted, you're ruining this for everyone.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11057","Barney","Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors shoot themselves in the foot.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11058","Lily","What are you talking about? Barney  If you must know, it wasn't a freak beverage malfunction that stopped me from riding the tricycle that night.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11059","Blonde Girl","So, Barney, why don't we take this party to a more horizontal location?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11060","Barney","Oh no, the night's ruined!","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11061","Brunette Girl","No, baby, it's not.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11062","Barney","Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11063","Marshall","Why would you do that to yourself?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11064","Barney","Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11065","Ted","See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11066","Barney","The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11067","Ted","It won't?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11068","Barney","No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong. (laughs) Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11069","Ted","Ladies, couldn't find your coats but I did find tequila.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11070","Trudy, Rachel","Oh!","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11071","Ted","Wait, wait wait, a remote control fire place? We don't have a remote control fire place.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11072","Rachel","I am so exhausted.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11073","Trudy","So exhausted.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11074","Ted","Why would I want to tire them out?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11075","Barney","That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11076","Rachel","You give the most amazing foot massage.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11077","Ted","It's 'cause I used to practice all the time on my grandmother.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11078","Ted","Why in God's name would I say that?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11079","Trudy","Ted, what's wrong?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11080","Ted","I was just thinking about this documentary I saw once about something called a supervolcano.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11081","Ted","OK, what the hell.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11082","Barney","OK, wait for it.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11083","Ted","Could happen at any time and obliterate all life on earth, which is why I live by three simple words. Don't postpone joy.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11084","Rachel","Oh my God.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11085","Trucy","That's so true.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11086","Ted","Yeah.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11087","Ted","Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11088","Barney","Yes you can.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11089","Lily","I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I'm actually moved. Bring it in, guys.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11090","Ted","All right.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11091","Ted","I'll see you on the other side.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11092","Barney","So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted  Doesn't seem right to talk about it.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11093","Barney","What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11094","Barney","You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11095","Barney","You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me!","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11096","Ted","Some stories you tell, some stories you don't.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11097","Barney","Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11098","Barney","Ted, belt.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11099","Barney","Did? Tell me. You know if he did it?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11100","Robin's date","Oh hey. Will you go in there and see if my date's OK?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11101","Waitress","No problem.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11102","Waitress","No, nobody's in there, but the window's actually open.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11103","Robins' date","I guess I shouldn't be so surprised. I mean, she was acting weird all night, right? Waitress  Yeah. You know...","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11104","Waitress","Why don't I buy you a drink?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11105","Robin's date","OK.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11106","Waitress","Did I overhear that you're a surgeon?","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11107","Robin's date","Guilty as charged.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11108","Waitress","You're so funny.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11109","Robin","I'm here, I'm fine, my head is bleeding. Going down again.","03","03","Third Wheel"
"11110","Future Ted VO","It was Saturday night in New York City and the young metropolitan set was out on the town, living the kind of crazy lifestyle you can only find in the Big Apple.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11111","Robin, Ted","97, 98, 99, 100!","03","04","Little Boys"
"11112","Lily","100! We only got to 82 on our honeymoon.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11113","Lily","So, Robin, I've got a guy for you. He's cute, he's funny, he's smart.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11114","Ted","What's his 'but'?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11115","Lily","What do you mean? Ted  When someone wants to set you up they always tell you the good qualities first but then they leave out their huge flaw.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11116","Barney","She's totally hot and really fun.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11117","Barney","(to himself) But she has a dead tooth.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11118","Marshall","She's superhot and she's so successful.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11119","Marshall","(to himself) But she has a pug that she pushes around in a stroller.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11120","Lily","She's so cute and she's so smart.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11121","Lily","(to herself) But her last boyfriend had to get a restraining order against her and then his cat and new vacuum cleaner both went missing.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11122","Ted","Wow, set it up.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11123","Ted","I'm still convinced she killed my turtle.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11124","Robin","Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11125","Barney","If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it!","03","04","Little Boys"
"11126","Lily","Well, there's nothing wrong with this guy. He's really nice and he's really cute.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11127","Ted","But? Lily  Fine, but he has a kid.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11128","Marshall","Oh.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11129","Ted","Aha! There it is. Robin's not going out with a guy with a kid.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11130","Lily","But the guy is really great. And his kid's sweet, he's in my class.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11131","Ted","Doesn't matter. Robin hates kids.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11132","Robin","I don't hate kids.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11133","Ted","You told me even when you were a kid, you hated kids.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11134","Little Girl","Robin, will you watch cartoons with me?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11135","Little Robin","I go to school all week. Can't I just have five minutes to myself to read Highlights and drink my juice?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11136","Robin","OK, yes, kids are not my favorite thing in the world but I like them.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11137","Ted","Well, you don't wanna have them.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11138","Robin","I like sports cars but it doesn't mean I wanna push a Ferrari through my v*g1n*","03","04","Little Boys"
"11139","Barney","Shotgun.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11140","Marshall","You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11141","Barney","Nice.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11142","Robin","You know what, the kid is not a problem. I wanna meet this guy.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11143","Lily","OK, that's awesome.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11144","Robin","Yeah. Hey, what's my 'but'? You know, I'm really nice, but...","03","04","Little Boys"
"11145","Ted","(to himself) But she's afraid of commitment.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11146","Lily","(to herself) But she's a gun nut.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11147","Barney","(to himself) But she's Canadian.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11148","Marshall","(to himself) But she didn't like Field of Dreams.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11149","Barney","I can't think of anything.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11150","Ted","You don't have a 'but'.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11151","Barney","OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11152","Ted","Why?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11153","Barney","The ultimate ice breaker.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11154","Barney","A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year. Suddenly we see these snake bastards sneaking towards a little baby. Not on our watch. You grab the kid, I strangle six cobras with my bare hands. Women of New York, one at a time please.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11155","Ted","So, what are the eye patches for?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11156","Barney","We got bit.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11157","Ted","On the eye? Barney  Yes.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11158","Ted","Both of us.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11159","Barney","They're different eyes. I don't see why this bugs you. Patch up!","03","04","Little Boys"
"11160","Future Ted VO","So, Robin went on a date with George, the guy with the kid. And afterwards...","03","04","Little Boys"
"11161","Robin","OK, here's the thing, George is a great guy, we had a wonderful date.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11162","Lily","But?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11163","Robin","Can't wait to meet him? Why did I say that? I don't wanna meet his kid.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11164","Lily","Well, you knew you'd meet him sooner or later.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11165","Robin","I was just hoping for later, like in 20 years when I'm a cougar and he's as hot as his dad.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11166","Lily","Robin, What's the big deal? He's just a kid. He's not gonna bite. He may bite. We're working on biting.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11167","Robin","Why is this kid around anyway? Shouldn't he be with his mom? What kind of lawyer does this guy have if he has to take care of the kid all the time?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11168","Lily","A good one. He won full custody.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11169","Robin","He won? He won. Oh God, getting the kid is winning, isn't it?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11170","Robin","Don't tell anyone I said that.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11171","Ted","OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11172","Barney","Oh, Theodore...","03","04","Little Boys"
"11173","Barney","...no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11174","Ted","Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11175","Barney","Oh yeah? I'm the New York state gaming commissioner.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11176","Ted","Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.","03","04","Little Boys"

"11178","Marshall","Wow. You're here and not in stall two.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11179","Ted","Yeah, so?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11180","Marshall","I may have made some wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11181","Barney","OK, Marshall.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11182","Marshall","Yes.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11183","Barney","Which one of us has more game?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11184","Marshall","Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11185","Barney","What? Marshall  If dating is the game, then marriage is winning the game.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11186","Ted","Yeah, if you're playing in the women's league.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11187","Marshall","You're joking. I have mad game, bra.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11188","Barney","OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11189","Ted","I hate to say it, buddy, but you're kinda' irrelevant.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11190","Marshall","What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11191","Barney","Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11192","Marshall","Do you guys wanna hear one of my lines?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11193","Ted","First of all, I did not ask to see that list and I am still horrified. True game is about quality, not quantity. And a quality girl would pick me over you any day.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11194","Marshall","Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11195","Barney","Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11196","Ted","Fine.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11197","Barney","There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges...","03","04","Little Boys"
"11198","Ted","Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11199","Barney","That's good too.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11200","Barney","How about her?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11201","Ted","You're on.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11202","Barney","Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11203","Ted","OK, great. Rule number one, no eye patches or props of any kind.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11204","Marshall","One time I was with this girl and I tried that model line, and I totally got some over-the-shirt boob action at a Just Say No assembly.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11205","Ted","Just stop. You're bumming everybody out.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11206","Ted","Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11207","Barney","I win.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11208","Ted","How?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11209","Barney","Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11210","Ted","Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11211","Barney","I can't sleep with her again. She hates me.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11212","Ted","Oh, Interesting. Look who just took a commanding lead. Now, with you out of the picture, I can take my sweet time.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11213","Marshall","Ted, she's leaving.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11214","Ted","Get out of my way.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11215","Barney","By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11216","Marshall","Look who's got game.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11217","George","You're a big kids person, huh?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11218","Robin","Only the biggest ever. I think kids are so great. Especially the little ones. You know, uh, pudgy, can't sit up, don't have teeth yet.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11219","George","Babies.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11220","Robin","Yeah, I like that kind.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11221","George","Well, Doug's almost six","03","04","Little Boys"
"11222","Robin","Oh, six is great. You are gonna love six. Six is when they really start to... (Robin nods) I hate kids.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11223","George","Excuse me, what? Robin  I mean, I don't hate kids. I'm just not a kid person. I mean, yeah, it's cute that their shoes are real little, but beyond that, what's the draw? You must think I'm nuts.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11224","George","What? No no no. So you don't like kids, so what? I'm not looking for a mother for Doug. Why don't we just hold off on you meeting him?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11225","Robin","Yeah, let's take things slow.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11226","Future Ted VO","And, kids, that's exactly what she did.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11227","Future Ted VO","Then on a totally different day that was definitely not the next morning, Aunt Robin had to face her worst fear.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11228","Lily","Hey, what's up?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11229","Robin","It's here, Lily. It's looking at me. The kid, what do I do?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11230","Lily","Just talk to him. You can do this, Robin.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11231","Doug","Who are you? Robin  I'm Robin.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11232","Doug","That's a bird's name.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11233","Robin","No it's not. It's actually a type of bird.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11234","Doug","My friend, Patrick, has a parakeet named Robin, so there. You wanna talk in Morse code?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11235","Robin","Dude, I'm just reading my paper.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11236","Doug","Beep, beep beep beep, beep beep, beeeep. I'm starving. Can you make me cereal?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11237","Robin","Sure.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11238","Doug","What are you doing? You're supposed to pour milk first? Robin  What? No, you pour the cereal first so you know how much milk you need.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11239","Doug","It tastes better milk first.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11240","Robin","It all tastes the same once it's in the bowl.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11241","Doug","Why are you wearing my dad's pants?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11242","Robin","Milk first it is.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11243","Doug","What are you reading? Robin  The business section. The Fed's gonna lower rates again to bail out these subprime lenders, bunch of idiots.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11244","Doug","Miss Aldrin says it's not nice to call people names.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11245","Robin","Well, maybe if they weren't such idiots, I wouldn't have to call them that.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11246","Doug","That's what I said. You're pretty cool.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11247","Robin","You too.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11248","Future Ted VO","Meanwhile, Stacy and I had started dating. Oh, Stacy was the girl from the bar. Anyway, I was close to winning the bet when something unexpected happened, I started to really like her.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11249","Ted","Well, have fun in yoga.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11250","Ted","She's strengthening her core. That's gonna be good.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11251","Ted","Yeah, all right. After a while, crocodile.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11252","Ted","You see this. Game face.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11253","Barney","Whatever, Ted.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11254","Ted","Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11255","Barney","Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11256","Marshall","I am not irrelevant. I ran the numbers. If Lily and I have s*x twice a week, which, let's be honest, we all know is being conservative. And we've been together for ten years plus seventeen more times on the honeymoon. Minus the two week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store reminded me of a young Lily. Then we have had s*x a total of...wait for it...","03","04","Little Boys"
"11257","Barney","Nice.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11258","Marshall","One thousand fifty-three and a half times...my mom called once. But that's more times than Barney has ever had s*x and to your point, Ted, Lily is a quality girl. I win. Lawyered.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11259","Barney","Doesn't count.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11260","Marshall","Totally counts.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11261","Ted","You're right, it counts. It counts as one. You've had s*x once. How was it? Marshall  I still matter.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11262","Barney","OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11263","Ted","Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11264","Barney","We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted  You know what, I don't mind. Barney  No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11265","Barney","No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going (lowers head slightly and shakes it vigorously) on what I've already gone (lowers head again slightly and shakes it vigorously) on.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11266","Ted","Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11267","Barney","Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11268","Ted","Fine.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11269","Barney","And I only stirred that with my pinky.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11270","Robin","Guess who loves Robin? Kids, kids love Robin. Doug thinks I'm pretty cool.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11271","Lily","Really, that's great. You and George, all thanks to me.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11272","Robin","Yeah, I'm gonna have to break up with him.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11273","Lily","What?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11274","Robin","Well, tt's just getting a little bit too serious with the kid. You know, it's just not what I'm looking for. So, better that I break it off now before he gets too attached.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11275","Robin","What?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11276","Lily","I hate to tell you this but, too late.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11277","Lily","He drew it in class today.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11278","Robin","Oh crap.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11279","Robin","There's no way that's a picture of me. That woman has on hoop earrings, I don't even own hoop earrings. I have one pair and they're gold. Those are Fruit Loops.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11280","Lily","You are so in denial right now. And you're doing what you always do in relationships.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11281","Robin","We'll ask the guys. They'll tell you that's not me","03","04","Little Boys"
"11282","Marshall","That's totally you.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11283","Robin","You guys are totally crazy.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11284","Ted","Hey, who drew the picture of Robin?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11285","Robin","It's not me.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11286","Marshall","You're joking, right?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11287","Robin","It's not me.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11288","Ted","""My new mommy."" Kinda has a nice ring to it.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11289","Marshall","Hey, now that you're a mom, are you gonna start wearing those totally awesome jeans that go right up to your boobs?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11290","Robin","Do guys really think this is me?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11291","Lily","Honey, it's you. And if you're gonna break up with George, you have to break up with his kid too.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11292","Robin","Really?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11293","Lily","Yeah, you can't just abandon him. You have to talk to him. Come on, Robin, you know it's the right thing to do.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11294","Robin","Man. Doug was right, you are a pain in the ass.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11295","Stacy","So, I, I had a really nice time tonight.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11296","Ted","Me too.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11297","Stacy","Yeah?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11298","Ted","Mm-hm.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11299","Little Barney","Hey, Ted, pucker up all you want but I was here first.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11300","Little Barney","From this spot, I also launched an expedition to those two large ridges down there.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11301","Stacy","Uh, Ted, something wrong?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11302","Robin","Hey, Doug.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11303","Doug","Are you here to see my dad? He's taking a shower.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11304","Robin","Actually, I came to see you.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11305","Doug","I wrote a poem, you wanna hear it.?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11306","Robin","Sure, why not?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11307","Doug","To my new mommy. You're pretty, you're nice, And you smell like daisies.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11308","Robin","Oh, that is so sweet, Even though it doesn't rhyme.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11309","Robin","Look, uh, Doug. There's no good way to say this.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11310","Future Ted VO","Aunt Robin didn't know what to say. This kid had never been dumped before.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11311","Robin","We need to talk. I just think, um, we both could use some space right now. It's not you, it's me. I know this hurts but you deserve someone better. I'm just really trying to focus on my career right now, you know. I just hope we can still be friends.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11312","Brooke","Hi, I'm Brooke, I'm here for my date with George. You must be the babysitter.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11313","Brooke","I had so much coffee earlier, I need to run to the loo. Hey Dougie.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11314","Robin","What the hell was that? Doug  That was my new mommy.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11315","Robin","So, this picture is not of me?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11316","Doug","Why would I draw a picture of you?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11317","Robin","How many dates has she been on with your dad?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11318","Doug","Two.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11319","Robin","Well, I've been on like five and you like her better?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11320","Doug","We just really connected.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11321","Robin","And what about me? You think I go around pouring cereal for every boy in town.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11322","Doug","Why are you getting so upset, Roberta?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11323","Robin","Robin. My name is Robin. Like the bird, remember?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11324","Doug","Whatever.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11325","Robin","So, that's it, huh?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11326","Doug","Look, you're great, but...","03","04","Little Boys"
"11327","Robin","Yeah, there's always a 'but'.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11328","Ted","Well, I couldn't do it. I broke up with her. Thanks a lot by the way. A beautiful, sexy girl and all I could think about was you being there first. You were stuck in my head like a Chumbawumba song.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11329","Marshall","Which Chumbawumba song? Barney  Well, what an interesting turn of events. It looks like I'm going to win.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11330","Ted","What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11331","Barney","That's what you think happened.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11332","Ted","OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any...","03","04","Little Boys"
"11333","Barney","Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11334","Stacy","You are so sweet.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11335","Barney","So now, whatever nice things Ted does for her, in her mind, I'm the guy who's even nicer than him.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11336","Ted","So you never slept with her?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11337","Barney","Not even at all.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11338","Marshall","Wow, that's good.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11339","Barney","It gets better. Remember Ted's phone conversation?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11340","Ted","Well., have fun in yoga","03","04","Little Boys"
"11341","Barney","Well?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11342","Barney","Oh.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11343","Stacy","I'm sorry.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11344","Barney","Stacy, right?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11345","Stacy","Yeah. Oh, you're Ted's friend from the bar?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11346","Barney","Yeah, wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here too?","03","04","Little Boys"
"11347","Stacy","I do.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11348","Barney","I'm gonna head out to a reggae concert. I'm a huge fan of reggae.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11349","Stacy","Oh my gosh, I play in a reggae band.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11350","Barney","No way, I wonder why Ted didn't tell me about that. Like I said, I'm a huge reggae fan.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11351","Ted","After a while crocodile.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11352","Stacy, Barney","See you later alligator.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11353","Barney","We are two peas.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11354","Barney","Wow, take care. Namaste.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11355","Ted","You are a sociopath. That was my yoga mat.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11356","Barney","So now with Ted out of the picture, I'm gonna swoop in and take the whole thing.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11357","Barney","Translation  'cause I got game, bitches.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11358","Ted","No, no, this doesn't prove anything because...","03","04","Little Boys"
"11359","Barney","Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11360","Barney","Hey, stace. What happened? He did not. Stay there, I'll be right over.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11361","Ted","I should have just worn that stupid eye patch.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11362","Lily","I can't believe you got dumped by a 6-year-old.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11363","Robin","Whatever. He's a stupid head. I'm just, I'm done with kids.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11364","Future Ted VO","Of course, Robin eventually made her peace with kids. And as you guys know she went on to appear in some very important works of arts. Yours.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11365","Stacy","Hey.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11366","Stacy","You know, I really appreciate how cool you've been about us taking things slow.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11367","Barney","That's what makes you so special, baby.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11368","Stacy","Anyway, I am so psyched to be playing Sun Splash tomorrow. We go on sometime between 11 and 6 so you probably wanna get there before nine to be safe. Oh, and it's gonna be muddy.","03","04","Little Boys"
"11369","Future Ted VO","Kids, back in the fall of 2007, I was dating this girl named...oh God, what was her name? It's been 23 years, I can't remember all this stuff. For the sake of the story, let's call her...","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11370","Ted","Everyone, this is Blah-blah.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11371","Blah-blah","Please call me Blah.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11372","Marshall","So, Blah, how did you two meet?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11373","Blah-blah","Well, I was taking this cooking class, French fusion, and everyone already had a partner but then I looked up, and across a crowded room, I saw Ted. It was magical.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11374","Ted","It was so magical.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11375","Future Ted VO","Except it wasn't.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11376","Ted","She's gonna tell some bogus story about a cooking class because she's embarrassed we met online.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11377","Marshall","Ay, Chihuahua.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11378","Ted","What? There's no stigma anymore.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11379","Robin","Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11380","Barney","So, she's hot.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11381","Ted","Oh, she's gorgeous.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11382","Barney","Then she's crazy.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11383","Ted","No she's not.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11384","Barney","Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11385","Ted","OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11386","Barney","There's no way she's above the line on the hot-crazy scale.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11387","Ted","She's not even on the hot-crazy scale. She's just hot.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11388","Robin","Wait, hot-crazy scale?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11389","Barney","Let me illustrate.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11390","Barney","A girl is allowed to be crazy...","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11391","Barney","... as long as she is equally hot.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11392","Barney","Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11393","Barney","If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11394","Barney","You want the girl to be above this line","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11395","Barney","Also known as the Vicky Mendoza diagonal. This girl I dated, she played jump rope with that line. She'd shave her head...","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11396","Barney","...then lose ten pounds.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11397","Barney","She'd stab me with a fork...","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11398","Barney","... then get a boob job.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11399","Barney","I should give her a call.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11400","Ted","OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11401","Barney","I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts...","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11402","Ted","She's not crazy.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11403","Barney","OK, we'll see.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11404","Blah-blah","Long story short, thank goodness I'm such a bad cook or I never would have met Ted.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11405","Barney","It's crazy how cute that is. It's crazy.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11406","Ted","You know who else has a really cute story of how they met? Marshall and Lily. You guys should tell that story right now.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11407","Blah-blah","Yeah. Marshall  All right, but spoiler alert, it ends with everyone saying 'aw.'","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11408","Lily","Aw.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11409","Marshall","Starts with it too.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11410","Future Ted VO","When you've been a couple as long as Marshall and Lily, telling the how we met story becomes a choreographed dance.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11411","Lily","It was late August 1996","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11412","Marshall","Lily and I were both freshmen moving into","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11413","Lily, Marshall","Hewitt Hall.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11414","Marshall VO","And she needed some help setting up her stereo.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11415","Lily VO","For some unknown reason, I felt drawn to room 110.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11416","Marshall VO","As if she knew that someone very special was behind that door.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"

"11420","College Lily","Hi.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11421","Blah-blah","Ohhh.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11422","Marshall","I know, right?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11423","Future Ted VO","Now, they perfected that story over hundreds of tellings. The first time Marshall told it to me, it was a little different.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11424","Marshall","Dude, this black-haired Goth chick stopped by today, (singing) wanna tap that.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11425","Blah-blah","You guys are so lucky. You know, when Ted and I were cooking and our hands touched for the first time, I knew right then that after class he would take me up on the roof, kiss me and give me a rose, which he did.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11426","Blah-blah","Saw 'aw.'","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"

"11432","Blah-blah","So, you're single.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11433","Robin","Yeah.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11434","Blah-blah","Hm. Oh, so, pretty and single and friends with Ted. Great.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11435","Ted","You know who else is friends with Ted? Marshall. How did we meet? It's a good story, I'm gonna tell it right now. Uh, it was the first day of college.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11436","Future Ted VO","Kids, to understand this story, you need to know that your Uncle Marshall was doing something that lots of college kids do. How do I say this? He was, uh, let's say eating a sandwich.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11437","College Guy","Dude, I heard the dean is coming. Put out your sandwich.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"

"11441","College Ted","Whoa. Someone's been eating a sandwich.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11442","College Marshall","What? No. Really? I don't know 'cause I don't even know what sandwiches smell like. My parents are gonna donate a lot of money to this school.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11443","College Ted","So you're bottom bunk, that's cool. I wanted the top bunk anyway.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11444","College Marshall","What do you mean?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11445","College Ted","I'm your new roommate. College Marshall  This is so unfair.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"

"11448","Robin","College, good times.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11449","Blah-blah","Oh, I get it. Ted told you I didn't go to college so now you're giving me a cute little backhanded slap.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11450","Barney","Oh, here we go.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11451","Blah-blah","Well, while you were busy majoring in being freaking beautiful, I was starting my own line of handbags.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11452","Barney","Your own line of handbags? That's crazy.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11453","Blah-blah","These have sold in Japan. Robin, have you ever sold anything in Japan?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11454","Robin","Uh, no, but I would love to buy one of them if... Where can I get one?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11455","Blah-blah","I don't have a distributor here yet, but thanks for rubbing that in. Why are you trying to undermine me in front of Ted?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11456","Robin","Look, there's nothing going on between me and Ted.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11457","Blah-blah","Wow, that just came out of nowhere.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11458","Robin","No, I'm just saying you don't have anything to worry about.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11459","Blah-blah","I wasn't worried. Are you saying I should be?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11460","Robin","No, I'm saying that you shouldn't be.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11461","Blah-blah","Oh good, 'cause I'm not. Now, Robin, could you just let it go? You're making all of us really uncomfortable.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11462","Ted","You know what else is a good story, how Barney and I met. Barney, tell that story, right now. Please.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11463","Barney","OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11464","Barney","Tonight's the first time I'm taking my deaf brother out since our mom died.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11465","Ted","Oh, I'm sorry about that.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11466","Barney","No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11467","Ted","Oh man, I'm really sorry.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11468","Barney","Wow, you bought that?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11469","Ted","What? Barney  I just made that up mid-pee. It worked on you, it's definitely gonna work on that blonde chick at the end of the bar. Unless you're a total idiot. What's your name?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11470","Ted","Ted.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11471","Barney","Are you a total idiot, Ted?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11472","Ted","Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Barney  (laughs) Well played.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11473","Barney","I like you Ted.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11474","Barney","Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11475","Barney","Barney. We met at the urinal.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11476","Ted","Oh right, hi.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11477","Barney","Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11478","Ted","I'm not wearing a suit.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11479","Barney","Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11480","Barney","Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11481","Barney","Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11482","Barney","(yelling at Ted) Edward, this is Audrey.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11483","Audrey","You know, I actually know some sign language.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11484","Audrey","(signing) Hi, my name is Audrey. Nice to meet you","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11485","Barney","He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11486","Ted","(signing) I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11487","Barney","What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11488","Ted","(signing) My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11489","Audrey","Here. Call me.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11490","Barney","And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11491","Ted","Barney, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11492","Ted","(signing) He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11493","Barney","Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11494","Blah-blah","Oh my God, you told them.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11495","Ted","OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11496","Barney","Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11497","Blah-blah","Wait, you guys dated. For how long?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11498","Robin","A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about s*x, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11499","Blah-blah","Oh, I see what's going on here, Ted, I'm just some random girl to make Robin jealous and after she takes you back, you probably won't even remember my name.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11500","Ted","Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11501","Barney","Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11502","Barney","She started the night here","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11503","Barney","But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11504","Barney","Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to kill me with a brick.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11505","Ted","I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Robin.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11506","Blah-blah","Then why has she been trying to undermine me all night? I mean, look at her. She's laughing at me right now.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11507","Blah-blah","I'm sorry, it's just Lily and Marshall's story is so romantic. I just wish we had something like that.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11508","Ted","Their story is not as magical as it seems.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11509","Blah-blah","What do you mean?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11510","Ted","No, I can't, it's kind of a secret.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11511","Blah-blah","Well, how about I tell you a little secret about what you might get to do later tonight.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11512","Ted","The night before Lily met Marshall, there was this party.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11513","College Ted","Hey, you a freshwoman? I never use the word freshman. Sexist.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11514","College Lily","Yeah, I'm a first-year. I'm in Hewitt 220.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11515","College Ted","No way, Hewitt 110. You should totally come by.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11516","College Lily","Maybe I will, Hewitt 110.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11517","College students","Chug chug chug chug","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11518","College Ted","These drunk idiots. Hey, don't drink their two dollar beer. This is a pinot noir from Europe.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11519","College Lily","Oh, it's fruity.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11520","College Ted","Yeah, I cut it with some cranberry juice, it's pretty strong.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11521","College Lily","So, uh, do you have a girlfriend?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11522","College Ted","Yeah. Not sure about the whole long distance thing though. It's like Descartes says, ""In order to determine whether we can know anything with certainty, we first have to doubt everything we know."" You know?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11523","College Lily","Wow.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11524","Ted","As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11525","Blah-blah","Oh my God.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11526","Ted","Yeah, and in all these years Lily and I have never spoken about it, so again, mum's the word, OK?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11527","Blah-blah","You have to tell Marshall.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11528","Ted","If he heard that, it would destroy him.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11529","Blah-blah","If you don't tell him, I will.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11530","Ted","Oh, come on, you wouldn't.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11531","Ted","Oh no.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11532","Blah-blah","So, Lily, how did you and Ted meet? Come on, Lily, the real story.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11533","Ted","I don't think anyone wants to hear that story.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11534","Lily","Don't be embarrassed, Ted, it was a long time ago.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11535","College Ted","I made a huge mistake last night, but it's like Descartes says.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11536","College Ted","In order to determine whether there's anything we can know with certain, we first have to doubt everything we know. And I now know for certain that I love you, Karen. Anyway, call me back when you get this. I'm also going down to the computer center to send you an electronic mail.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11537","College Marshall","Ted, this is Lily.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11538","College Ted","No, no, I'm sorry but I love Karen.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11539","Ted","Yes, that is the unabridged story of how Lily and I met. How embarrassing. Who wants another round?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11540","Blah-blah","That's not the story, Ted, tell 'em.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11541","Marshall","Tell us what?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11542","Ted","Lily, will you help us get the next round?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11543","Lily","Ted, what's going on?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11544","Ted","She knows about us, about how we really met.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11545","Lily","Yeah, I know, I just told her.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11546","Ted","No, the real story.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11547","Lily","Ted, what are you talking about?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11548","Ted","Lily, come on.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11549","Lily","Come on what?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11550","Ted","Lily, come on.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11551","Lily","Ted, I honestly don't know what you're talking about.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11552","Ted","Lily, come on.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11553","Blah-blah","I know that you and Ted made out the night before you met Marshall.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11554","Lily","What? Ted and I never made out.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11555","Ted","Yeah, we did.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11556","Lily","I only made out with one other guy in college before I met Marshall, and it was just some random dude. I don't even remember his name. I just call him too-much-tongue guy.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11557","Ted","What? Too-much-tongue guy? I'm not surprised to hear that coming from unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11558","Lily","That wasn't me.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11559","Ted","Yes it was, at the freshman orientation party.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11560","Lily","No, no no no no no no no no no no no.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11561","Barney","How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin  Yeah, like five or six times.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11562","Barney","It was right over there.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11563","Barney","Here's your problem, you've only slept with one woman. Those kind of stats are only okay if you're eleven. But tonight, we're getting you a new girl because Marshall Eriksen, from this moment on, I make all your decisions for you.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11564","Marshall","I'm sorry, who are you again?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11565","Ted","This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11566","Barney","I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11567","Ted","You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11568","Barney","No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11569","Ted","So we should make lots of Star Wars references around girls, that's what you're saying?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11570","Marshall","I'm not gonna cheat on my girlfriend.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11571","Barney","Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11572","Barney","How much hotter is she than your girlfriend? Marshall  There's no comparison. What do you think, Ted? Go for it? Ted  Oh, don't do it, man. Think about Lily.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11573","Marshall","You know what, I don't care. I've been with one woman for too long. I need me some strange.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11574","Barney","Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11575","Barney","Poor guy's gonna crash and burn.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11576","Barney","That man is a god.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11577","Marshall","For like a week after, Barney followed me around, asking me to teach him how to live. I even got him to do my laundry once.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11578","Barney","I thought it was a Mr. Miyagi kind of thing.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11579","Lily","Marshall, I need to talk to you. Can we go somewhere in private?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11580","Marshall","Yeah, of course, what's wrong?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11581","Blah-blah","Lily and Ted made out. What do you think of that, Robin? Marshall  What are you talking about? Lily  You know that guy I made out with at the freshman orientation party?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11582","Marshall","Too-much-tongue guy? Yeah.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11583","Ted","And you know that girl I made out with at the freshman orientation party?","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11584","Marshall","Unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl? Yeah.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11585","Ted","I'm too-much-tongue guy.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11586","Lily","And I'm unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11587","Barney","Worst superheroes ever.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"

"11589","Marshall","I don't think you need to be. I was at that party. It was dark, and granted, I had eaten quite a few sandwiches but I'm a hundred percent sure that unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl was Alexa Leskies, it's not Lily.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11590","Ted","Really? Marshall  Yeah, I'm positive. And too-much-tongue guy was Colin O'Riley.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"

"11594","Blah-blah","Another girl, Ted? Who haven't you made out with? You know what, I don't need this. I design handbags. I'm writing a memoir. I'm a superstar. This is totally my year. Someday the name Blah-blah will be up in lights. Ted, next time you're online playing World of Warcraft, don't even think about chatting with me.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"

"11602","Future Ted VO","...there wasn't a doubt in my mind, that was your Aunt Lily.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"
"11603","Future Ted VO","But you know that magical story of how she and Uncle Marshall met, it was worth preserving, so I kept my mouth shut.","03","05","How I Met Everyone Else"

"11664","Robin","Oh, no! No, I meant, that Ted Mosby, he really knows what he's doing. Like all Ted Mosbys. (to Marshall) Wow, NRDC! Way to go, Marshall.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"

"11667","Marshall","I'm not doing that interview. Those people are evil.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11668","Lily","Marshall, your dad went through a lot of trouble to set this up. You can't just pull out at the last second.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"

"11682","Robin","Wow. That's 42 movies a month. Who is he, Jude Law? Right? He makes a lot of movies. I mean, not so much lately, but maybe, like, two years ago, you couldn't go to a movie without...","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11683","Ted","Shh.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"

"11689","Ted","Well, I don't want to say it's my project. I mean, I'll be working with at least three partners.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11690","Leonard","Oh! Group scene. Always fun.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11691","Ted","Yeah. Yeah. I'm really looking forward to it. I mean, I know they're gonna ride me pretty hard but they're great guys.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"

"11694","Lily","""This project was so demanding, I can't tell you how many nights I spent bent over a table.""","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11695","Lily","Oh, hey, baby, how'd the interview go?","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11696","Marshall","Um, interesting. There I am in the office of Jefferson Coatsworth and I figure I'm not gonna take this job anyway, I might as well give this old b*st*rd a piece of mind. Jefferson Coastworth wasn't what I expected.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11697","Jefferson","Marshall, Jefferson Coastworth.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11698","Marshall","Hello.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11699","Jefferson","Dude, I am so, so psyched that you're here. Can I beer ya?","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11700","Narrator","Marshall was thrown. This guy seemed nice. Of course, he wasn't.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11701","Jefferson","Go to hell! I'd do it again! (To the media) I'm innocent. I'm innoncent.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11702","Jefferson","Marshall, why don't you want to work at Nicholson, Hewitt and West?","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11703","Marshall","Right, um, okay, Jeff, I've actually given this a lot of thought...","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11704","Jeff","I'm sorry. Stop. I can't do this with a straight face. You don't want to work here. You're only here 'cause your dad went to high school with Joe Hewitt. Fact is, you just got a sweet job at the NRDC. And it's awesome. Man, I could have gone the non-profit route. I didn't. And it eats me up inside every day. I hate myself. I hate myself.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11705","Barney","Oh, he is good. Classic seduction technique.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11706","Marshall","What do you mean?","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11707","Barney","Oh, I use it all the time. First I buy her... and by her I mean you... a drink. Now, I'm the guy who gets her what she wants. Then I pretend to care about whatever idiotic thing she cares about. For you, that would be the enviroment. Now, I'm the great guy who shares her interests. And before you know it, you're naked in my apartment, shouting ""oh-oh Bar-r-r-ne-e-y""! And by you, I mean her.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11708","Marshall","He is not trying to seduce me. He didn't even offer me the job.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11709","Barney","That comes later. At dinner. He did invite you to dinner, didn't he?","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11710","Jeff","Let me buy you a dinner. Tomorrow night. As a thank you, okay? You'll tell me all about the NRDC, and we'll charge it all to one of my evil clients.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11711","Marshall","I, you know, I don't know if...","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11712","Jeff","Marshall, you know what kobe beef is?","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11713","Marshall","The most expensive beef in the world.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11714","Jeff","The place I'm taking you has kobe lobster. That is lobster fed with kobe beef.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11715","Marshall","Oh my God. He's trying to seduce me.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11716","Robin","So are you gonna go to dinner with him?","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11717","Marshall","No. No way. I promise myself to the NRDC. I'm not that kind of lawyer.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11718","Lily","Oh, you should go. I mean, you're not gonna take the job, but you might as well get a great meal out of the deal.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11719","Barney","Don't wait up.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11720","Robin","Guys, guys, guys, check this out. Ted Mosby p0rn star's bio says his hometown is your hometown. Shaker Heights, Ohio.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11721","Ted","What? Okay, this is getting creepy. Who, who is this guy? I gotta find him.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11722","Robin","Well, it's your lucky day. He's gonna be signing autographs tomorrow night in Manhattan at something called the Adult Video Expo.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11723","Lily","Hmm. Wait, are you telling me that they actually have conventions for p0rn?","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11724","Barney","Affirmative. Or to put in another way... God bless America.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11725","Marshall","You can really taste the beef in that lobster.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11726","Jeff","Right, listen, I know we're only here to screw over my client, who quite frankly deserves it... hum, but I gotta be able to tell the guys upstairs I gave you the spiel, okay? So, first up, starting salary. (He gives him a paper).","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11727","Marshall","Okay. Here we go. This is the big number that's supposed to impress me and... (He looks at the paper) whoa, that's a BIG number.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11728","Jeff","There's also a signing bonus, uh, use of a company car, expense account, blah, blah, blah. Hey, by the way, turn around and wave to Patrick Swayze.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"

"11730","Jeff","He's a client. Who do you think bought us this wine? (To Patrick) Crazy, Swayze. Cheers, buddy.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11731","Marshall","Okay, no. Jeff, this is all very impressive, but I just don't think that...","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11732","Jeff","Listen, I know, I know. You are not gonna be tempted by big numbers and fancy perks. You're gonna do the noble thing, take the low-paying job at the NRDC, live off you family money.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11733","Marshall","Family money?","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11734","Jeff","You do have family money, don't you?","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11735","Marshall","No, hum, not that I know of. I do have an uncle who owns a, a pretty successful bait shop.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"
"11736","Jeff","NRDC. No family money. Hum. So you don't plane on having kids?","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"

"11739","Narrator","He was surely doing a tough decision. Now, kids, when I'm faced with a tough decision, I like to make a list of pros and cons. Marshall knew all cons. (We see the list. Pros  Money, Security, Swayze. Cons  Evil.) But there is one thing he didn't know, a big guy live in a pros con.","03","06","I'm Not That Guy"

"11774","Marshall","Ted! How many times have i asked you to put the lid back on the peanut butter jar? (Ted wants to speak but Marshall goes on) It's this sort of incoiderate, immature jackassery that makes me feel like i'm living in the Realworld house, and not the early years when they all had jobs and social consciences. I'm talking about Hawaii and after! I can't take this anymore!","03","07","Dowisetrepla"

"11868","The girl","Wow, i feel so at home here.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11869","Barney","I'm glad. Sometimes, i don't. A place like this really needs a lady of the house. I know it's early to be thinking of you as... Oh, God, i'm freaking you out, aren't I? It's just you make me feel so safe. I didn't...""","03","07","Dowisetrepla"

"11875","Bank employee","Yes, but since you're a married couple, you'll be applying for a joint loan, so.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11876","Lily","Well, can we just go ahead and do it in my husband's name? He's the head of the household. He earns the big bucks. I mean, can women even own property?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11877","Marshall","Go ahead, just give him your social.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"

"11886","Bank employee","You have quite a bit of debt.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11887","Marshall","My student loans. Great. I thought we were friends. you know what, it's fine to penalize me for trying to get an education and bud a career, but i will not let you deprive my beautiful wife of her dream home just because i...","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11888","Bank employee","Okay, actually, it's because of your wife's credit card debt.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11889","Lilly","Marshall, there's something i have to tell you, and i want you to hear it from me first.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11890","Robin","Okay, let me get this straight. You just snuck this girl into some stranger's apartment?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11891","Barney","Yeah, we spent the night.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11892","Barney","Hey, look at you.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11893","Girl","I'm wearing your bathrobe. I hope you don't mind.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"

"11900","Barney","How about you get in the shower, and i will make us some waffles.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11901","Barney","Works at every time.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11902","Robin","Wait. That time that you offered to walk my dogs when i went to visit my dad in Vancouver...","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11903","Barney","Yup!","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11904","Robiin","Is that why my Yorkie trembled for like a week after i got back?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11905","Barney","Yeah. That little guy saw some stuff i'm not proud of.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"

"11907","Ted","There was a fight here.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11908","Robin","What do you mean?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11909","Ted","Whenever Marshall and Lily have a big argument, they always leave a trail of evidence all over the apartment.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11910","Robin","Oh, God here we go. He had a detective club as a kid.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11911","Ted","HUm the Mosby boys cracked a lot of big cases.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11912","Robin","The Mosby boys? You mean you and your sister.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11913","Ted","We solved the mystery of the missing retainer.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11914","Robin","Let me guess, it was in the garbage.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11915","Ted","Why are you like this? Anyway, this is serious. I know Lily and Marshall. All the tell tale signs are here. Like this","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11916","Robin","A water bott.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11917","Barney (to Robin)","Don't touch the evidence. (to Ted) I got your back partner.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11918","Ted","It's not stiny water bottle. Notice the label is peed off.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11919","Ted","Just as i suspected, Cherry Garcia. Given the liquid consistency, i place the fight between... noon and 1.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11920","Robin","Ew, that was on the floor.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11921","Barney","If you wwant to get to the bottom of this, you're gonna need a stronger stomach than that, doll face.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11922","Ted","Marshall stood here. Eating and yelling, yelling and eating. Lily stood here. Crying. (Ted takes a handkerchief on the bar of the kitchen)","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11923","Robin","Hey, Ted!","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11924","Ted","And then Marshall tried to storm out... but Lily went for the Hail Marpass.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11925","Barney","What do you think, make obsess?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11926","Ted","There'd be a bigger mess. tempted as he was, Marshall was still too upset.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11927","Robin","Which Is why this picture is crooked.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11928","Ted","Nice catch, Robin.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11929","Barney","I'll just, uh, take this down to the lab. (He wants to take the wonderbra. Robin grab it from him).","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11930","Ted","Now that we need is a motive. The million dollar question what were they fighting about?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11931","Robin","I know what they've been fighting...","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11932","Ted","bup bup bup bup bup... Theres's only one possible conclusion. Lily and Marshall are fighting about peanut butter.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11933","Barney","Ah!","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11934","Ted","Lily left the lid off... (Ted put dark sunglasses) and marshall blew heads.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11935","Robin","I know what they were fighting about, and it wasn't peanut butter.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11936","Barney","Robin, just...","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11937","Ted","I appreciate your help, but there's a reason your name is Robin, not Batman.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11938","Barney (to Robin)","Just...","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11939","Robin","They were fighting because they didn't get the loan and it's all Lily's fault.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11940","Barney","Robin, just...","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11941","Ted","What?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11942","Robin","Yeah, she has a pile of debt the size of mount... Rushmore","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11943","Ted","Nice try Robin. So, the next thing Lily did was give Marshall a few hours to cool off about the peanut butter. Then she called him to apologize, which is why the last number dialed is... (Ted take the phone and see the last number)","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11944","Phone Voice","Greenstein and Lee, Divorce Attorneys. (Surprised, Ted throws the phone)","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11945","Ted","This can't be happening.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11946","Barney","They can't... get divorced.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11947","Ted","Not Lily and Marshall, no way.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11948","Robin","Well, it's been nice knowing you guys.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11949","Ted","What do you mean?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11950","Robin","Well, Marshall's gonna get yyou guys, Lily's gonna get me.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11951","Ted","Even if they break up, that doesn't mean we can't all hangout. I mean we broke up and we still hang out. It's not weird.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11952","Robin","It's a little weird.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11953","Ted","Yeah, it is. It's weird.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11954","Barney","The world needs Marshall and Lily... together... I'm not crying, there's something in my eye.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11955","Robin","They're back.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11956","Marshall","Hey, hey guys.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11957","Lily","We have an annoucement.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11958","Barney (going to cry)","I know, it's a terrible idea. You can't do it. Just look at me.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11959","Ted","I hit redial on the phone. Divorce lawyers?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11960","Lily","Ow, I should explain. We got in a pretty big fight.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11961","ted","Yeah, I know","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11962","Lily","Marshall stormed out.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11963","Marshall","I went, uh, to the bar.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11964","Lily","Still drinking that?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11965","Marshall","I paid for it. And apparently money's tight now, so...","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11966","Lily","Listen, i've been thinking about this, and i know there's no way to undo what i've done, but, well, I made an appointment with a divorce lawyer.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11967","Marshall","What?! What?!","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11968","Lily","Oh no no! no, no, no","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11969","Marshall (in the same time)","You want a divorce now?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11970","Lily","No! I just mean on papers, so that you can buy the apartment without my bad credit dragging us down.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11971","Marshall","Lily... are you trying to kill me?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11972","Lily","I'm sorry, i shouldn't have led with the divorce lawyer part.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11973","Marshall","No, you shouldn't have! I love you, Lily.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11974","Lily","I love you too, and i want us to have our dream home. And well, i don't know, it seems like this is a way to do it. So Marshall Eriksen, will you divorce me?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11975","Marshall","That's the sweetest divorce proposal i've ever heard.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11976","Lily","So is that a yes? You can't sleep with other women though.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11977","Marshall","No we're not getting divorced, not even on paper. Lily, when i married you, i married your problems too. The ones i knew about and the ones i didn't. So that was the deal, we'll figure this out together. (They kiss, the waitress comes)","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11978","Wendy, upset, with a black eye","Can i get you guys anything else?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11979","Robin","So you're not getting a divorce?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11980","Lily","No!","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11981","Ted","Wow, guys! You scared us.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11982","Barney","Oh, thank God. Cause, i mean, if you did then who'd be the lame married couple i get to make fun of? Like 'Hey Marshall, you're married mrs right, you just didn't know her first name was Always.' That stuff is cold.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11983","Robin","So what's the annoucement?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11984","Marshall","I just got off the phone with the Realtor. We told her that, uh, because of our finances, we're not getting the place. It's just --it's not the right time.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11985","Narrator","Is what Marshall should have said.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11986","Lily","We're home on earth!","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11987","The others","Are you insane?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11988","Narrator","Is what we should have said.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11989","Together","Yeah!! (They hug each other)","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11990","Marshall","Ow this is exciting!","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11991","Lily","Yeah! There it is! Our new home!","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11992","Marshall","Shall we?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11993","Lily","We shall.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11994","Lily","Oh! what a horrible smell.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11995","Marshall","It reeks!","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11996","Cab driver","Oh, that's just the plant. Don't worry, they shut it down on the weekends.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11997","Lily","Wh-what plant? What are you talking about?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11998","Cab driver","Don't you know? Baby, this whole neighborhood is downwind of the sewage treatment plant.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"11999","Marshall","Wait... What did you just say?","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"12000","Cab driver","I said, we're downwind of the sewage treatment plant.","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"12001","Marshall & Lily","Oh oh","03","07","Dowisetrepla"
"12002","Now, months later, the results of that exam were scheduled to post online at 10","00, and it was 9 59.","03","08","Spoiler Alert"
"12003","It's true what they say","blondes have more fun.","03","08","Spoiler Alert"
"12004","Ted from 2030","Back when we were dating robin and I had this running joke. We were the only two people in the world who found it funny.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12005","Barney","No way! March does not have 31 days.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12006","Marshall","Yes, it does! Everyone knows that. It's like general knowledge.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12007","Ted & Robin","General knowledge.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12008","Ted from 2030","And we did it all the time.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12009","Lily","Isn't it sad? I mean in 2007, some countries actually still condone corporal punishment.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12010","Ted & Robin","Corporal punishment.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12011","Ted from 2030","Because once you start, it's surprisingly hard to stop.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12012","Marshall","Oh, man, I got a kernel stuck in my teeth.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12013","Ted & Robin","Colonel stuck-in-my-teeth.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12014","Ted from 2030","But now, we were broken up,so when Marshall said...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12015","Marshall","But after the first year,I get a major pay raise.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12016","Ted from 2030","We just let it slide. You see, on the surface, Robin and I looked like we were doing great. But the truth is, trying to be friends with your ex is a lot harder than it looks. You can't be as candid as you used to be.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12017","Ted","So then this hot intern leans over my desk, I can totally see she has a pierced... (Robin and Lily walk across the room) Brosnan. Pierce brosnan is my favorite of all the bonds.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12018","Ted from 2030","But most importantly, you can never, ever be alone together.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12019","Barney","I gotta go.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12020","Marshall","I'm gonna go pay.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12021","Lily","Peeing.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12022","Ted","I'm gonna help marshall pay.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12023","Robin","I'm gonna help lily pee.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12024","Lily","All right,we have a turkey.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12025","Marshall","Yeah, we do.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12026","Lily","Isn't this exciting? Our first Thanksgiving together as a group.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12027","Marshall","Yeah, this is gonna be the best Slapsgiving ever.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12028","Barney","What?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12029","Marshall","I said this is going to be the best Thanksgiving ever.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12030","Ted","yeah, this is going to be great. Just the five of us, right?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12031","Robin","Oh, uh, that reminds me, I invited Bob.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12032","Lily","Bob? You've been on, like, three dates with that guy. We haven't even met him.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12033","Robin","Well, he didn't have anywhere else to go, and I didn't know what to say. Is it really that big a deal?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12034","Lily","Yes. This is our first Thanksgiving. 30 years from now, we're going to look at the photos and say, ""Oh, there's the four people I love most in the world... and Bob.""","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12035","Robin","I'm sorry,sometimes I forget how seriously you guys take American Thanksgiving. Real thanksgiving happened over a month ago.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12036","Barney","I'm sorry. Did you just say Canadian Thanksgiving was and I'm quoting,""the real Thanksgiving""? What do Canadians even have to celebrate about?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12037","Robin","Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find the northwest passage.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12038","Barney","Why are you guys even a country?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12039","Marshall","Oh, hey, by the way, if anyone wants to come over early thursday, we can watch the Slapsgiving day parade.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12040","Barney","Well, there, you said it again.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12041","Marshall","Said what?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12042","Barney","Slapsgiving.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12043","Marshall","Oh, I guess I did. You know why? I've invented a new holiday  Slapsgiving. It's the one day we set aside each year to gather together and give slaps.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12044","Ted from 2030","I should explain. Kids, you remember the slap bet a year earlier, Marshall made a bet with Barney and won the right to slap him five times. He had already used the first and the second. But Marshall had something special in store for the third.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12045","Marshall, on the phone with Barney","slapcountdown.com.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12046","Barney","no.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12047","Barney","No, no. The countdown ends at 3 00 p.m., the day after Thanksgiving. I counted it out.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12048","Ted","How many days are in october?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12049","Barney","Uh, thirty.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12050","Ted","Dude, I thought we cleared this up last year.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12051","Barney, with a funny accent","I like Halloween very much. Is nice.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12052","Ted","Is also tomorrow.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12053","Barney","Damn it!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12054","Barney","Wait, you're gonna slap me on Thanksgiving?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12055","Marshall","Slapsgiving.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12056","Barney","That's not allowed. Lily, you're the slap bet commissioner, is that allowed?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12057","Lily","The hostess in me who's using her wedding china for the first time wants to say hell, no, but yeah, I 'm going to allow it.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12058","Barney","Well, you know what? If you're trying to freak me out about spending Thanksgiving...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12059","Marshall","Slapsgiving.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12060","Barney","...at your place, then you failed. Truth is, I'm not scared.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12061","Marhall","Really?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12062","Barney","Right. Cause you blew it. The worst part about getting slapped is not knowing when it's going to happen. But now I know exactly when I'm gonna get slapped. So, you took all the suspense out. You showed your hand.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12063","Marshall","And thursday at 3 01 p.m., your face is going to show my hand.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12064","Robin","Oh, there's Bob! By the way, heads up, he's a little bit older than us.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12065","Ted","How old is he?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12066","Robin","He's forty-one. Hey, bob! Over here!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12067","Ted from 2030","Okay, kids, the truth is, Bob probably looked like this.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12068","Bob","Hey, sweetie.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12069","Robin","Hi.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12070","Ted from 2030","But when your ex is dating someone new your mind tends to accentuate their flaws. This is how I saw bob.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12071","Bob","Hey, dudes,what's crackin'?.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12072","Ted","Hey, man, how are you?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12073","Bob","Good to meet you. Sorry I'm late. I just got off the phone with my parents.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12074","Ted","Parents?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12075","Bob","They were totally on my case  ""What are you gonna do with your life? You're forty-one."" and I'm like, ""Chillax, snowboarding is a legit career. you ought to be stoked I found my bliss."" and speaking of bliss,sugar me, baby. ( Robin and Bob kiss)","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12076","Robin","Let's go get a drink.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12077","Ted","Unbelievable. Robin is dating Orville Redenbacher.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12078","Lily","What are you talking about? He's forty-one.he looks great.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12079","Marshall","Yeah, du he's in pretty good shape. He could probably kick your ass.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12080","Ted","How are you guys not seeing this? He's 150; Robin's 27. Barney, come on,what do you got?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12081","Barney","Nothing but respect for that man.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12082","Lily","Oh, by the way, we're all baking pies at robin's tomorrow. Marshall can't be trusted in the apartment with pies overnight.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12083","Marshall","For the millionth time, sleep-eating is a very serious and delicious medical condition.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12084","Ted","Hey, uh, what time are you guys going to robin's?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12085","Lily","7 30.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12086","Ted","Perfect. Just to be safe, I'll get there like 8 00, 8 30.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12087","Ted","Sorry I'm late. Where are Marshall and Lily?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12088","Robin","Uh, they just called. They're both super swamped preparing for tomorrow.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12089","Ted","Is Bob coming?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12090","Robin","No, he went to see green day.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12091","Ted","So it's...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12092","Ted and Robin","...just the two of us.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12093","Robin","Making pies.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12094","Ted","Pies. They're things that friends make together.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12095","Robin","Yeah, they do.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12096","Ted","Great.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12097","Robin","Yeah.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12098","Ted","Great. Well, this is great. It'll give us a chance to catch up.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12099","Robin","Yeah.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12100","Ted","I'm going to make a phone call. (On the phone with Barney who is at the Bar) Hey, it's me. listen, you have to come over here and make pies.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12101","Barney","Yeah, I'll be there, absolutely.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12102","Ted","Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver. It's still kind of weird being alone with Robin, but if you were here...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12103","Barney","Hey, say no more. I mean, when I pulled you out of that burning wreckage, I wasn't doing it to have a battleship named after me. But if you insist, yes, I'll be there for the christening.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12104","Ted","You're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12105","Barney","No, I'm not going to wear the medal of honor. That would just be tacky.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12106","Ted","So you're not coming to make pies.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12107","Barney","No, no. Thank you, mr. President. (He hungs up) Sorry.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12108","Ted from 2030","After a very long night, it was finally the big holiday. Sorry, the two big holidays.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12109","Lily","Oh, marshall, are you working on the cranberry sauce?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12110","Marshall","In a minute, baby. I've only got so many hands. You see what I got going on here? They're turkeys, but they're also hands, because later, we're going to eat turkey... and then i'm going to slap you in your face.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12111","Barney","Please, you took out all the suspense. In a horror movie, the killer does not grab a bullhorn and announce, ""Attention unsupervised teens here at the lake house  at precisely 3 00 a.m., I'm gonna jump out of that closet right there and hack you all up with a machete. P.S. fire is my one weakness.""","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12112","Robin","Hey, ted.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12113","Ted","Hey, happy Thanksgiving.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12114","Robin","You, too. Is lily in the kitchen?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12115","Ted","yep.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12116","Robin","Great.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12117","Ted","Marshall?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12118","Robin","Lily?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12119","Ted and Robin","Something really weird happened last night.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12120","Marshall","What do you mean something weird happened last night?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12121","Ted","You may not realize this, but since we broke up, Robin and I have never really been alone together.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12122","Ted","So we're in the kitchen, starting on the pies, and we realize, we don't have a damn thing to say to each other.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12123","Ted","I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now. You just feel like everything you say is gonna make things worse.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12124","Barney","Exactly. And you know why? Because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about, especially around the holidays. I mean, what decent human being would want to cause any kind of emotional or physical pain...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12125","Marshall","You're still getting slapped.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12126","Ted","I wanted to leave, but i couldn't stick her with making all the pies by herself. She was exhausted.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12127","Robin","I yawned like a million times trying to get him to leave.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12128","Lily","Yeah, some people just can't take a hint. By the way, I'm really swamped in here.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12129","Robin","I kept looking at the clock and sighing... totally clueless.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12130","Lily","Uh-huh. I'm not sure I have time to mash those potatoes, you're standing right next to.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12131","Robin","And then Ted does the thing that he always does when there's an awkward silence.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12132","Lily","Yep. masher's right there, next to the pot.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12133","Robin","He panics and says the first thing that pops into his head.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12134","Robin","Hey, did you know that the first pies in recorded history came from Ancient Egypt?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12135","Ted","Remember last year's Thanksgiving, when we had s*x seven times?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12136","Barney","Ooh. terrible.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12137","Ted","What?! I thought it would break the ice.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12138","Robin","I'd already broken the ice with my cool pie fact. then he makes it ten times more awkward.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12139","Lily","How do you respond to something like that?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12140","Robin","Did you know that the egyptian pyramids can be seen from space? Probably?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12141","Ted","Ooh, the oven's pre-heated!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12142","Robin","Okay, um... the pecan pie is gonna take the longest. Why don't we put that one in first?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12143","Ted","Pecan pie? Why are we making that?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12144","Robin","Um, it's my favorite.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12145","Ted","You're allergic.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12146","Robin","I know. I just like smelling it. It's like eating with your nose.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12147","Ted","So we're making a pie for Bob.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12148","Robin","Yeah.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12149","Barney","She's got you making pies for this guy?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12150","Ted","Yeah.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12151","Marshall","That is a real slap in the face.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12152","Ted","You know, you could have just told me it was for Bob.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12153","Robin","Yeah, I-I just thought it might upset you.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12154","Ted","Upset me? Wait a second. Do you think that......Do you think that I'm jealous of Bob?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12155","Robin","I don't know. Is it so ridiculous to think that you might be?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12156","Ted","Yes.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12157","Robin","Why?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12158","Ted","Because he's a thousand years old.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12159","Lily","No, Ted! What are you doing?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12160","Robin","Right?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12161","Ted","The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that we can only talk about the first Thanksgiving,","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12162","Robin","Come on.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12163","Ted","The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is because I heard noah gave him shotgun in the ark.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12164","Robin","Ted...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12165","Ted","The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that I'm just an architect, but he discovered fire. How do you top that?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12166","Robin","He's 41! Why are you bashing on him so hard?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12167","Ted","I'm not. I'm just joking around. That's what friends do.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12168","Robin","It's mean.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12169","Ted","Well, how come we're all allowed to bust on barney when he dates some skanktron, but when you sleep with the crypt keeper's dad, I'm not allowed to say a word?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12170","Robin","First of all, Bob and I are not sleeping together. We're just dating. Secondly, have I said one word about the parade of dubious conquests you've been marching past me the last few months? One of whom got you a butterfly tattoo?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12171","Ted","Hey, that is...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12172","Robin","And if you and I are such good friends... why is baking a pie for Bob so weird?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12173","Ted","Yeah, if you and i are such good friends, why couldn't you just tell me that's what we were doing? Okay, maybe we should talk about this later. I-I should get going.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12174","Robin","Well, what are we doing? It's Thanksgiving.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12175","Ted","I don't know. I'm sorry. This is stupid.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12176","Robin","I'm sorry, too. Of course we're friends. I'm glad we're friends.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12177","Ted","me, too.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12178","Lily, Marshall and Barney","You guys slept together last night?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12179","Lily","That is a terrible idea!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12180","Marshall","Horrible idea.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12181","Barney","Relapse five! That's where we high-five, then it's awkward for a little bit... and then we high-five again!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12182","Lily","What the hell were you doing? Let's review  you and Ted broke up six months ago. You're dating another man...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12183","Robin","You are correct, Sir.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12184","Lily","...who's coming to my thanksgiving today...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12185","Robin","That is a truth-fact.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12186","Lily","...an event Ted is also attending.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12187","Robin","kablammo.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12188","Lily","Why are you trying to destroy American Thanksgiving?!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12189","Robin","Oh, Lily, it's not as bad as it sounds. Bob and I aren't that serious, and what happened last night with Ted was a fluke.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12190","Lily","Well, did you guys at least talk about it?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12191","Ted","There's office material...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12192","Robin","I hear something burning...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12193","Ted","Clearly, we need to ignore this.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12194","Robin","Clearly, we need to talk about this.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12195","Ted and Robin","You know? to save the friendship.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12196","Robin","We need to talk.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12197","Ted","Stuffed mushroom?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12198","Robin","We need to talk about last night.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12199","Ted","Did you know that some mushrooms are carnivorous? Probably... not?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12200","Robin","Ted, can we please just deal with this? Look, I'm not mad. I just think...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12201","Ted","Wait, wait, wait, wait. why would you be mad... you started it?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12202","Robin","What?! you're crazy!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12203","Ted","We called a truce, we hugged, and when I tried to pull away, you kept your hand on my neck.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12204","Robin","Only because your hand was still around my waist.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12205","Ted","Oh, come on! You leaned into it.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12206","Robin","I... leaned into it?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12207","Ted","Yeah. You're like the crappy kid in little league who knows he's not going to make contact, so he just...""Oops, I got hit by the pitch. Better take my base.""","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12208","Robin","Oh, that was you in little league, wasn't it?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12209","Ted","My on-base percentage was off the charts!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12210","Marshall","Oh, no! The slap-petizers.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12211","Lily","You know what? That's it! This is Thanksgiving. Solve this right now. And if you have s*x again, neither of you gets dessert! Oh, what the hell kind of Thanksgiving is this anyway?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12212","Barney","Um, most Thanksgivings.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12213","Marshall","Don't stress, baby. I'll try to find us something relaxing.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12214","Lily","Thanks, baby. Ooh, some classical music, maybe.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12215","Marshall","Oh, my! Look at that. That means we're in the final hour of the countdown.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12216","Barney","I'm not scared.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12217","Marshall","Then why is your right cheek twitching? It's not... maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard, it reverberates back to the present, shattering the time-slap continuum.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12218","Barney","Please don't slap me.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12219","Marshall","I'm sorry, what?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12220","Barney","Oh, God! don't slap me again! I don't want to get slapped again, and the first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it! I don't like it one bit!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12221","Marshall","I thought I ruined it by putting a clock on it, Barney?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12222","Barney","Well, you didn't ruin it; you made it so much worse! I can't eat. I can't sleep. I've lost ten pounds; my suits are wearing me. You know what? I'm outta here.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12223","Marshall","Well, no, no, no. you can't leave.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12224","Barney","Why can't I?! Nowhere in the rules does it say that I have to sit through sort of mental torture! You are allowed to slap my face, Sir, but you are not allowed to slap my mind! Good day!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12225","Marshall","But it's Slapsgiving.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12226","Lily","No! It's not! It's Thanksgiving! Our first one as a married couple, as grownups and you're not even trying to be a part of it! None of you are! So... as slap bet commissioner, I'm issuing a ruling. Thanksgiving is a day of peace. There will be no slaps today!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12227","Marshall","What?!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12228","Barney","Yes! In your face! Not my face... your face!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12229","Bob","What's up, dudes?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12230","All","Hey, bob.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12231","Marshall","Baby,please... -no!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12232","Lily","The slap bet commissioner's word is final, so get in the kitchen and mash some potatoes, now. And for the rest of the day, we are going to enjoy a civilized, grownup holiday.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12233","Bob","Not too grownup. I made jell-o shots. We're gonna get silly, bitches.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12234","Robin","Look at us! We can't be alone together, can we?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12235","Ted","Apparently not.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12236","Robin","What does that mean? We're supposed to be friends.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12237","Ted","We aren't friends, are we? Not really. We avoid each other. We smile politely. We're two people who pretend to be friends because it would be inconvenient not to.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12238","Robin","Well, maybe we should stop pretending.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12239","Ted","Maybe we should.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12240","Robin","So... what do we do now?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12241","Ted","I suppose... we eat dinner. And then that's it.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12242","Robin","Okay.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12243","Ted","Happy Thanksgiving.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12244","Ted from 2030","So we sat down to our first Thanksgiving together as a group...and, apparently, our last.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12245","Barney","Marshall, you're not eating. Did something spoil your slap-petite?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12246","Marshall","No, i just thought...before we eat, maybe the chef would like to say a few words.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12247","Lily","Nope. This sucks. Eat up and leave.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12248","Marshall","Well, then, I'd like to say something. If that's cool? Um... today, Lily did something great. Not only did she gather us all here together and cook a delicious meal, but she also started a new tradition. We're gonna do this again next year, and the year after that... maybe for the rest of our lives. I think that's pretty amazing if you think about it. And it's all thanks to you,Lily. I love you. So, to the first of many Thanksgivings together.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12249","Bob","This is rad! A nice, small,simple Thanksgiving. I'm the youngest of ten in my family, so our Thanksgiving is a mess. All the yelling and the screaming...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12250","Ted from 2030","And then a funny thing happened...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12251","Bob","It's really a major buzz-kill.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12252","Ted and Robin","Major buzz-kill.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12253","Lily","Oh, no...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12254","Barney","I thought we were done with that?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12255","Robin","I guess we're not.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12256","Ted","Guess we're not.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12257","Ted from 2030","You see kids, friendship is an involuntary reflex... It just happens,you can't help it. That first Thanksgiving turned out to be a wonderful dinner with the four people I love most in the world... and Bob and it did become a tradition. That's why every year,we go to aunt Lily and uncle Marshall's for Thanksgiving.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12258","Barney","Hey, check it out! We're in the last 20 seconds of Marshall's countdown to nothing.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12259","Lily","Barney, put it away.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12260","Barney","How does it feel, Marshall,to sit there, impotently... your large, flaccid hand,just dangling in the wind?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12261","Voice","The slap will occur in ten..","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12262","Barney","Ooh, classy touch, dude. Too bad!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12263","Lily","Barney, put it away.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12264","Voice","...six...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12265","Barney","I will in... five...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12266","Voice","... five, four...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12267","Lily","You can slap him.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12268","Voice","...three...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12269","Barney","What?! Wait, you...","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12270","Voice","...two...one.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12271","Marshall","That's three! Thanks, baby, you're the best. And as a special, added bonus, I've composed a song just for this occasion. Ted, lights! (Marshall starts playing the piano and singing) *What is this feelin' that's put you in your place a hot, red burnin' on the side of your face you feel the blood rush to your cheek. Tears start to fill your eyes and your lips are tremblin' but you can't speak,you're tryin', oh, you're tryin' not to cry! You just got sla-apped-oh, oh! Across the face, my friend-oh, oh, oh! You just got slapped. Yes, that really just happened. Everybody saw it and everybody laughed and clapped, it was awesome. Wait,you just got... slapped. Happy Slapsgiving, everybody.*","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12272","Lily","Well, guys have fun.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12273","Ted","This is gonna be majoy cleaner.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12274","All","Major cleaner!","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12275","Marshall","Oh man, we're gonna be doing this all the time, now aren't we?","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12276","Robin","That's the general idea.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12277","All","General idea.","03","09","Slapsgiving"
"12278",NA,NA,"03","10","The Yips"
"12279","Lily and Marshall (laughing)","Oh my god!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12280","Ted (gets out of his bedroom)","I have a tattoo!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12281","Barney","oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12282","Ted","a tramp stamp?!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12283","Narrator","kids, too often in life, we make decisions that we're not prepared to live with. (a man with a tattoo ""rex&evelyn forever"" cries) This is a story about those decisions, and the consequences that follow. (Ted is in the clinic, hidden derriere a newspaper)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12284","Ted","Say goodbye, kids, 'cause it won't be around much longer. (He shows his tattoo)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12285","Lily","oh, but Ted, if you get rid of the butterfly, how's everyone gonna know you're a stripper fron reno with daddy issues?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12286","Ted","yes, yes, enjoy these final moments of mockery because in just ten surprisingly expensive sessions, Stella is gonna zap that butterfly right off the face of my lower back.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12287","Lily","Stella?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12288","Ted","Dr Stella Zinman. She's the best in the business. And she's rather cute in fact. In fact... we're going to a movie together tonight.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12289","Barney","what?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12290","Ted","I asked her out.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12291","All","Ted, why would you do that?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12292","Barney","what's matter with you?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12293","Ted","What? What do you mean?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12294","Barney","Dude... don't poop where you eat.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12295","Ted","oh, no, this doesn't count.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12296","Marshall","If it's someone you see on a regular basis, and you can't avoid them...","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12297","Lily","and in this case, you're paying them... then yes, it counts.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12298","Barney","You've heard of the golden rule, right? ""love their neighbor?""","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12299","Ted","uh, actually, it's ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" It's from the bible.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12300","Barney","Damn it Ted, i've worked out this whole thing where the golden rule is ""love thy neighbor"", ok?... Now the golden rule is ""love thy neigbor"". But, there's one rule above it  the platinum rule  ""never ever, ever, ever, love thy neighbor.""","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12301","Ted","Well, that's cute. But she's not my neighbor, she's my doctor. So if you'll excuse me...","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12302","Robin","Wait, Ted, Barney has a point. Remember what happened with me and curt down at the station?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12303","Marshall","Oh, yeah, and remember what happened with us and the gerards across the hall?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12304","Barney","Need i remind you about me and Wendy the waitress?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12305","Ted (combs his hair)","yeah, i don't have time for this. I'm out the door as soon as i'm finished with my hair.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12306","Barney","good, then we've got a solid half hour. And in that time, we will convince you not to set foot out that door. It's a story older than time, my friend, and it always plays out in the same eight steps. Step 1  Attraction.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12307","Barney","It's true.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12308","Marshall","That's not even possible.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12309","Barney","12 of them.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12310","Marshall","There's no way.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12311","Wendy","Here's your gin and tonic.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12312","Barney","Thanks.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12313","wendy","O gosh! Look at that. (She leaves scrubing a stain in her shirt, Barney starves at her with interest)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12314","A man","Oh, hey! You must be our new neighbors. I'm Michael.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12315","A women","and i'm laura.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12316","Marshall","Oh, hi, welcome to the building. Yeah.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12317","Laura","Do you guys know any good brunch places around here?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12318","Lily","We love brunch!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12319","The host","You must be Robin.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12320","Robin","yeah!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12321","The host","Curt ""the iron man"" irons. I'm gonna be doing sports.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12322","Robin","Oh, welcome. You look really familiar. Are you a former athlete?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12323","Curt","Hockey.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12324","Barney (off voice)","The attraction is instant and undeniable.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12325","Barney","But you know better. You've seen your friends make the same mistakes before. You've laughed smugly at them.(laughs) Idiots! But still, you think, ""this is different. The platinum rule doesn't apply to me."" And that step 2! Bargaining.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12326","Robin","I think i've got a little crush on our sports guy.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12327","All","NO! no, no, don't do it!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12328","Robin","I know, i know but he used to play hockey, and i'm canadian. I can't help it. If he were missing some teeth, i probably would have already hit that.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12329","Lily","Robin, it's a mistake. Remember what happened with me and Marshall? The Gerards across the hall?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12330","Lily","Michael and LAura. They're awesome. We're gonna invite them over for dinner.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12331","The others","Oh no, no guys guys! Are you insane?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12332","Ted","This is NYC.You don't get close to the neighbors. You nod at them politely in the hall. You call the cops if you haven't seen them in a while and you smell something funny, and that is it.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12333","Lily","we're not gonna date them. We're just gonna be friends with them.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12334","Barney","That's the couples version of dating.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12335","Robin","And you've got the couples version of the hots for them. Oh, yeah, you want to browse at pottery barn with them. You want to go antiquing with them, don't you? Oh, yeah, you want to antique the crap out of them.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12336","Barney","Need i remind you what happened with me and Wendy the waitress?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12337","Barney","I've decided to seduce Wendy the waitress.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12338","The others","No! Don't do it!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12339","Barney","Request denied! What rule is there that say's i can't seduce the waitress at my favorite bar?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12340","Lily","I don't know. I'd expect you to have one already.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12341","Robin","Yeah, with some sort of catchy name.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12342","Barney","Well, i don't. I don't have one and i never will be because it's a great idea. Come on, guys! She's gullible. I'm bored. We're perfect for each other.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12343","Ted","Barney, we love this bar. If you screxw over Wendy the waitress, you're going to kill the bar.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12344","Robin","Bar killer.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12345","Marshall","Don't kill the bar, dude.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12346","Barney","yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12347","Barney (to Marshall and Lily)","And it was a huge mistake.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12348","Marshall","yeah, well, i think it'll be okay.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12349","Lily (to Robin)","And it was a huge mistake.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12350","Robin","yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12351","Robin","And it was a huge mistake.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12352","Ted","yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12353","Barney","Ted, trust me. You don't want to do this.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12354","Ted","Look, Stella and i are adults; we're both smart, mature people capable of making good decisions.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12355","Robin","You have a butterfly tramp stamp.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12356","Ted","We're just seeing a movie. If it seems at all weird, i'll back off.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12357","Barney","That's what everyone thinks and then along comes step 3  Submission.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12358","Barney","Good night!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12359","Wendy","Hey Barney! Carl had to take off. You mind giving me a hand?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12360","Barney","Not at all.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12361","Curt","Robin! I got 2 tickets to the rangers. Center ice. Want to go?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12362","Laura","and then we discover the movers lost all our kitchen boxes. We don't have a single pot or pan.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12363","Michael","Guess we're ordering take-out.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12364","Lily","Want to have dinner with us tonight?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12365","Wendy","That was an intersting use of the beverage gun.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12366","Barney","Club soda can get anything off.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12367","Wendy","It finally happened, all this time, every drink i brought you... I always felt there was this unspoken connection between us. And i was right!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12368","Barney","hey, can i get a gin and tonic?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12369","Ted","See, i bet you didn't pay for that gin and tonic.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12370","Barney","oh, i paid for it.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12371","Ted","But you got to admit, there is an upside to breaking the platinum rule. Like maybe as her boyfrien, i could get a discount on treatments.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12372","Barney","Oh, Ted, of course there's an upside. At first, that's step 4  Perks.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12373","Robin","we can split a cab to work together. We always have a standing lunch date. And last night, at the hockey game, Curt got us into the locker room, and i met Mason Raymond. Left wing for the Vancouver canucks.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12374","Barney","What the opposite of name-dropping?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12375","Robin","Damn it you guys, be psyched. Yes, we see each other every day, but i think it's going really well.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12376","Lily","That's what we thought.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12377","Lily","And it's so conveniant. They're right across the hall. Say it's sunday and we want to have a brunch double date with someone.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12378","Marshall","We just go across the hall.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12379","Lily","And say we want to have a dinner party exploring the wine and cuisine of France's Loire Valley.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12380","Marshall","We just go across the hall.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12381","Lily","Say we want to play a game of charades...","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12382","Barney (guessing)","you just go across the hall? (Marshall agreed)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12383","Lily","Come on people, get excited for us! We've got a great thing going here.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12384","Barney","That's what i thought.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12385","Marshall","Dude, you got to flick it.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12386","Barney","you don't have... (Wendy the waitress comes and serves food to Barney)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12387","Wendy","Hi, sweetie. I had the kitchen whip these up, no charge. (They kiss) Okay. Bye. I mean, not bye. I'm not leaving. I'll be over there. okay. (She leaves)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12388","Barney","Come on, guys, free nachos. What?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12389","Ted","We like this bar.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12390","Marshall","Don't kill the bar, dude.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"

"12395","Lily","You're killing the bar.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12396","Barney","I'm not killing the bar. Wendy the waitress has seen how i operate in this place. It is perfectly clear to everyone involved that this is nothing more than a temporary fling. (Wendy starves him, lovely) It's fiiine.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12397","Barney (to Lily and Marshall)","But it wasn't.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12398","Marshall","It's fine.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12399","Lily (to Robin)","But it wasn't.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12400","Robin","It's fine.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12401","Robin","But it wasn't.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12402","Barney","Which brings us to step 5  THE TIPPING POINT.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12403","Curt","...but he should be back on the mound by spring training and that's sport. Back to you, Robin.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12404","Robin","Thanks iron man we'll be right back.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12405","Productor","and clear.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12406","Robin","So you want to do something later?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12407","Curt","Oh, so you're talking to me now?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12408","Robin","What are you talking about?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12409","Curt","I'm talking about last night. You said you'd call and you didn't. I missed you and i waited up, but you didn't call. That really hurts.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12410","Robin","oh, um, i'm sorry, i-i guess i just forgot.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12411","Curt","I'm sorry Sweetie. I don't want to fight tonight. It's our first weekiversary. (he hugs her)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12412","Marshall","on my suggestion, you... (Barney looks at a girl)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12413","Barney","hey, Wendy, uh, do me a favor and send a glass of champagne to that pretty young girl over there.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"

"12415","Barney","over there... YOU... you're the pretty young thing...is what i meant. Champagne? Would you? on me.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12416","Wendy","Oh, okay, thanks sweetie. (She kisses him)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12417","Barney","okay. All right.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12418","Michael","hey, neighbors.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12419","Laura","We bought all the fixings for a mexican fiesta.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12420","Lily","um, well, we actually have tickets...","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12421","Michael","and no fiesta would be complete without","03","11","The Platinum Rule"

"12423","Michael","charades!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12424","Laura","What do you say?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12425","All","Oh no!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12426","Barney","which brings to step 6.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12427","Ted","Yeah, listen i'm leaving so if you want to write the rest of these down, i will read it tomorrow.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12428","Barney","Don't do this Ted.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12429","Ted","You want to get out of the way?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12430","Ted","Don't do this Ted. Don't (He brushes his hair in a mess)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12431","Ted","Dude! ya! It was perfect! You're such a jerk!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12432","Barney","Which brings us to step 6. You finally realize you've made a huge mistake and now you have to live with it. Step 6 is called purg... wait for it. Keep waiting. Keep waiting for the eternity only to dicover there's no escap-atory.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12433","Robin","God, i'm such an idiot.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12434","Marshall","yeah.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12435","Robin","Curt ""the iron man"" irons keeps leaving me love notes on post-its. On the teleprompter, on my desk, on the coffee-maker, on the jar of sugar packets next to the coffee-maker.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12436","Lily (reads a post-it)","""here's some sugar for my sugar.""","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12437","Robin","The iron man. oh!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12438","Marshall","I remember that.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12439","Marshall","Ro! we are such idiots!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12440","Barney","Yeah!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12441","Lily","Every time we step out the door, they're out there waiting for us. Sometimes, we'll send Ted out first as a scout. Nobody's there. Then we'll go out one second later, and there they are.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12442","Marshall","It's freakin' supernatural. Are they ghosts? Can only we see them?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12443","Lily","""Hey neighbor!"" ""Hey, neighbor""""Hey neighbor.""","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12444","Barney","I remember that.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12445","Barney","How could you guys let me date Wendy the waitress?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12446","All","oh you are kidding me?! What?!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12447","Marshall","Don't kill the bar dude!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12448","Lily (same time)","We said ""don't do it!""","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12449","Barney","tss (He looks at a girl but Wendy is right behind, she smiles, he looks desperate)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12450","Ted","You've got a whole meat locker at home full of corpses, don't you?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12451","Barney","Now look at me. Declawed. Neutered. What was once my jungle is now my zoo and i am forced to mate with the same old lioness again, and again, and again while families pay to watch.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12452","Ted","yeah, this metaphor's really falling apart.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12453","Barney","Put a bell around my neck and scratch my belly kids, for i am just a docile housecat now. Miaou!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12454","Lily","Well, we love this bar. You can't dump her. Marry her if you have to.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12455","Robin","Wendy the waitress hyphen Stinson.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12456","Marshall","don't kill the bar dude.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12457","Barney","And so, inevitably, you have to do the thing you've been dreading all along. Now, a relationship-ectomy is a delicate surgery as it is, but in the case of the platinum rule, it takes a very, very steady hand, and that's step 7  CONFRONTATION.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12458","Robin","Curt, we need to talk. I like you...","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12459","Marshall","guys, we like you a lot...","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12460","Barney","I don't like you.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12461","Robin","We're pretending this works, but it doesn't. And i'm getting a little sick of the whole charade.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12462","Lily","We're getting a little sick of charades.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12463","Barney","I mean, i don't like you that way. I used to like you that way but now that i've seen everything there is to see, i don't know, i kind of want to see those same parts just on other girls.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12464","Robin","So maybe we could go back to just being coworkers.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12465","Marshall","Maybe we should just go back to being neighbors.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12466","Barney","other girls and you, if you're into that but the other girls have to be there, too. That's the important part.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12467","Wendy","Gosh, you're just terrified of ever getting close to anyone, aren't you?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12468","Barney","or that. Let's say it's that. So can i get a gin and tonic?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12469","Barney","And in any other relationship, that would be it. End of story. But because you have to see this person again, there's a step 8  FALLOUT.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12470","Robin","And now, here's Curt ""the iron man"" irons with sports. Curt? (he's demoralized) Curt?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12471","Curt","Well, the Knicks lost. It's sad, really. They had a real shot. Then, out of nowhere, game over. And why? Why Robin?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12472","Robin","Uh, well, their perimeter shooting has been a little bit off this season...","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12473","Curt","The knicks lost because they were afraid of getting hurt. So they didn't even try. Well, you know what i think? I think the knicks didn't deserve my love to begin with. Kincks suck! (He gets out, on tears)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12474","Robin","And that's sports.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12475","Lily","Do you see anything?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12476","Marshall","I think we're clear.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12477","Lily","ok go go go. (They go out but the door of the Gerards opens, they gets in quickly)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12478","Marshall","That was close.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12479","Lily","Too close. (Someone knocks on the door) You've got to be kidding me. What do we do?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12480","Marshall","I have no idea. (it knocks again)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12481","Ted","guys, are you here? I forgot my keys. Can you open up?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12482","Lily","It's just Ted!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12483","Marshall","Wait! (He looks at the judha  Ted is alone)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12484","Ted","Hello? Guys? (Marshall looks again and see the Gerards go out their apartment)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12485","Marshall","Baby, we only have one choice.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12486","Lily","Okay, hurry! (They come down to the rescue ladder) Michael and Laura are probably...","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12487","Laura","Hey, neighbors.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12488","Wendy","Barney, i just want you to know, i have no hard feelings. It wasn't the best idea for us to get involved. I hope we can still be friends.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12489","Barney","Thanks Wendy. Of course we can.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12490","Wendy","If you need anything else, let me know.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12491","Ted","waouh. I've got to hand it to Wendy the waitress that was very mature of her.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12492","Barney","She's gonna try to kill me. This is poisoned.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12493","Ted","What? You're being ridiculous.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12494","Barney","Yours is poisoned too. She's trying to kill me and everyone close to me.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12495","Ted","What are you talking about?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12496","Barney","Ted! Look at the facts. I dump her and she says ""no hard feelings"". She's a psycho! What other explanation is there?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12497","Ted","Uh, that you're letting yourself believe she's crazy so you don't have to face the far more likely possibility that she doesn't want to date you either?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12498","Barney","Where did Marshall get that hamburger?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12499","Ted","I don't know, i guess Wendy the Waitress brought it to him.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12500","Barney (in slow motion, comes towards Marshall)","Noooooooo! (He throws his hamburger away)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12501","Marshall","Dude.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12502","Barney","You're welcome.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12503","Robin","Wait a second. You've been sitting here, pretending to be the expert on all this, but the truth is, this was no real fallout from your breakup at all?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12504","Barney","Yet.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12505","Robin","You're an idiot.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12506","Ted","All right, i'm taking off.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12507","Barney","What?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12508","Ted","I have a date. (Barney brushes Ted's hair in a mess)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12509","Ted","You're such a jerk!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12510","Barney","Ted, have you not been listening? Attraction, bargaining, submission, perks, tipping point, purgatory, confrontation, fallout! These things will all happen to you as surely as they happened to all of us! It's a rule of nature.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12511","Ted","Well, i'm sick of all the rules! There's too many of them! The hot/crazy scale, the lemon law, the platinum rule! If everyone in the world followed every one of your rules, the human race would cease to exist. Yes chances are to Stella and I are not going to live happily ever after the overwhelming odds have it ending badly. And when that happens, it'll be for one of a million possible reasons. But that doesn't mean i'm not gonna try. And when it does fail, so help me god, it's not gonna be because of some rule. (He watches himself in th mirror) PS  you just made my hair look awesome. Good night. (He leaves)","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12512","Narrator","So Stella and i went on our date. But here's the funny thing  turns out, it wasn't actually a date.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12513","Marshall","So what do you mean ""it wasn't a date""?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12514","Ted","She thought we were seeing a movie just as friends.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12515","Marshall","Why would she think that?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12516","Robin","Did she see your tattoo and assume you were gay?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12517","Ted","Apparently, there's a rule that says i can't date Stella.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12518","Barney","Exactly, the platinum rule. Stella reads my blog.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12519","Ted","No, this rule comes from the american medical association. Doctors aren't legally allowed to date their patients.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12520","Lily","Oh, sorry Ted.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12521","Ted","It's okay. What are you guys watching?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12522","Narrator","So that was the end of the story between me and Stella, at least for the time being. But i don't know, looking back on the platinum rule, i think there's a ninth step. We'll call it coexistence. It's the moment you realize that all that anger and resentment just isn't useful.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12523","Robin","Thanks for watching.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12524","Curt","Good night.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12525","Narrator","and you start to let go of it.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12526","Marshall&Lily (to Michael&Laura)","Hey guys!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12527","Lily","So what do you guys have going on tonight?","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12528","Laura","We're going to have a few friends over.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12529","Michael","gonna play some charades.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12530","Marshall","Have fun.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12531","Narrator","And move on with your life.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12532","Narrator","It just takes a while.","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12533","Barney","Thanks. (She leaves and he throws the drink) Crazy!","03","11","The Platinum Rule"
"12534","In fairness, I did call Ted's butt at, like, 2","00 this afternoon.","03","12","No Tomorrow"
"12535","So on March 17, 2008, I went to a big St. Patrick's Day party. And it's a good thing I did, because, funny story","your mother was there.","03","12","No Tomorrow"
"12536","Okay, it's official","do bad things, good things happen.","03","12","No Tomorrow"
"12537","There's three rules of cheating","NA There's three rules of cheating","03","12","No Tomorrow"
"12538","First skipped message","I don't see no ring on this finger.","03","12","No Tomorrow"
"12539","And then last night started coming back to me","NA And then last night started coming back to me","03","12","No Tomorrow"
"12540","Next message","Can you put it on my tab?","03","12","No Tomorrow"
"12541","Next message","I really want to hook up with you, leave before breakfast, and then never see you again.","03","12","No Tomorrow"
"12542","Next message","...out of whack...","03","12","No Tomorrow"
"12543","Ted from 2030","Kids, sometimes in life you see someone and you just instantly know this is the person for you. It can happen anywhere. Even the waiting room of a tattoo removal clinic. And that's what happened when I met..Stella.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12544","Stella","Ah, the butterfly tramp stamp. My bread and butter. So I'm guessing that the real story involves a bad breakup and some booze. Unless it's a gang tattoo, in which case, I think it's time to find a new gang.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12545","Ted","No, I just thought it would be cool to get a caterpillar tattoo, and then a few weeks went by, and all of a sudden...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12546","Stella","Well, I can get rid of it in ten one-hour sessions, but, I should warn you, laser surgery's very painful.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12547","Ted","Well, I think you'll find I have a very high tolerance for pain. Just last night, I sat through the worst movie ever made.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12548","Stella","Oh, Plan 9 From Outer Space?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12549","Ted","No, the worst movie... Manos  Hands of Fate.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12550","Stella","Uh, I'm a doctor, went to medical school. It's Plan 9. If you don't believe me, it's playing down at the Pamela Theater.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12551","Ted","Uh-huh. I don't believe you, Doctor.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12552","Stella","Well, what are you doing tonight?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12553","Stella","Hey, Ted.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12554","Ted","Hey. Hey, put that away. Tonight's on me.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12555","Stella","Oh, no, no, don't...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12556","Ted","Come on, I insist.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12557","Stella","That's so nice. Thank you. Hey, guys, this is my friend Ted. (3 women approaches) He wants to pay.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12558","Ted","Oh, wow. Oh, yay. Wow, thank you. One, two, three, four.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12559","Woman 1, to Ted","Is something wrong?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12560","Ted","No, it's just, um... I'm just a little embarrassed. I thought this was a date. But it's no big deal. Don't worry about it.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12561","Woman 2, to Woman 1","What's wrong?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12562","Woman 1, to Woman 2","Ted's embarrassed-- he thought this was a date.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12563","Woman 2, to Woman 3","Ted thought this was a date.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12564","Woman 3, to Stella","Stella, did you know Ted thought this was a date?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12565","Stella, to Woman 3","What? I'm not allowed to date a patient. It's an AMA rule.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12566","Woman 3, to Woman 2","She's not allowed to date patients. It's an AMA rule.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12567","Woman 2, to Woman 1","She's not allowed to date patients. It's an AMA rule.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12568","Woman 1, to Ted","She's not allowed to date...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12569","Ted","Yeah, I got it.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12570","Man","We all got it. Ted's a schmuck.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12571","Stella","And you bought all the tickets.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12572","Ted","Yeah, yeah. Hey, you were right. Worst movie-going experience ever. Of course, it had nothing to do with the movie.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12573","Stella","I am so sorry that you thought that was a date.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12574","Ted","No, it's fine. I got to hang out with you on girls' night out. All right, so if you're not allowed to date a patient, I'll just... I'll wait until these ten session are up and then I'll ask you out then.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12575","Stella","Well, then,fair warning  I'm going to say no.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12576","Ted","Really? I'm getting mixed signals from you. I feel like you've been staring at my ass for quite some time. What, you're married?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12577","Stella","No.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12578","Ted","Boyfriend?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12579","Stella","No.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12580","Ted","Lesbian?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12581","Stella","No.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12582","Ted","Only date black guys?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12583","Stella","No.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12584","Ted","And yet you can say with absolute confidence that ten weeks from now, if I ask you out on a date, your answer will be...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12585","Stella","No.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12586","Robin","No... Hmm. What could she mean when she says 'no'? I don't know, it is totally cryptic.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12587","Ted","This is far from over. We're talking ten weeks from now. Who knows what she'll want then? Do you know what you're going to want for lunch ten weeks from now?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12588","Marshall","Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail and a milk shake.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12589","Barney","Ted, do you know how long it takes a woman to decide whether or not she's going to sleep with a guy? 8.3 seconds. After that, her decision is made. She will not change her mind.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12590","Ted","That's ridiculous.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12591","Barney","Is it? Describe your first 8.3 seconds with Stella.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12592","Stella","Lower back butterfly tattoo... you're up.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12593","Ted","So we got off to a rocky start. That may be a problem for some guys, but I get better over time. Right? I'm not some Top 40 song... easily digestible. I'm complex. I require time and multiple listens. I'm 'Stairway to Heaven'.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12594","Robin","Wow, Roger Daltrey just rolled over in his grave. That's not the right guy, is it? He's not even dead, is he?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12595","Lily","I think that's great, Ted. You can do whatever you set your mind to. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm going to stop biting my nails.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12596","Marshall","But, baby, you love biting your nails.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12597","Lily","I know, but I'm doing this for Ted. Hmm. God, this is really hard.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12598","Ted","Give me ten sessions, I'm going to turn that ""no"" into a ""yes.""","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12599","Barney","Really, Ted? You think so? Well, tell me, how did the rest of that session go?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12600","Stella","This is going to hurt a little.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12601","Ted","Yeah, well, I can handle pain. This one time I was playing tennis, and... (He screams in a high-pitched ton)","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12602","Stella","Yeah, but tattoo removal really hurts. Everyone probably sounds like that.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12603","Abby","Doctor, are you all right? I heard a woman screaming in here. Oh. (she starts laughing and leave)","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12604","Ted","Here's to nine more great sessions.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12605","Ted from 2030","Weeks went by. The second session I told her about how I spent a summer working with inner-city kids. The third session we both spoke nothing but French. The fourth session I made her laugh so hard she fell out of her chair. So by the time the fifth session came around...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12606","Stella","Still no.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12607","Ted","Still no. What's up with that? I mean, I juggled.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12608","Barney","You juggled? I thought you were trying to impress her.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12609","Ted","You do magic. How is juggling any lamer than magic?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12610","Barney","Magic's not lame.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12611","Ted","I don't get it. I mean...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12612","Barney","Is this lame?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12613","Robin","Oh, Barney, no, no. We said no fireballs at the table.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12614","Marshall","What the hell is wrong with you?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12615","Robin","There's alcohol in here.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12616","Lily","Barney...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12617","Barney","I...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12618","Lily","We've talked about this. It's a fire code violation.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12619","Barney","Yeah, but Ted provoked me.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12620","Lily","No, no, you are on a time-out. Go sit over there.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12621","Barney","But...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12622","Lily","Go!","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12623","Ted","Anyway... I don't get it. She should be into me by now.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12624","Lily","You know, you can do this, Ted. I said that I would stop biting my nails, and kablam-ey. It's just a challenge. It can't be easy to woo someone while you're sticking your naked butt in their face.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12625","Marshall","Works for baboons. It's called ""presenting.""","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12626","Ted","I got four sessions left. Ther-There's got to be an angle I'm not seeing.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12627","Barney","You can't turn a ""no"" into a ""yes,"" Ted. Can't be done.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12628","Robin","I don't know, Barney. I mean, sometimes persistence pays off. I said ""yes"" eventually.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12629","Barney","No, you didn't. You were like, ""No, we can't, we're friends. It would mess up the dynamic of the group.""","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12630","Robin","To Ted.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12631","Barney","Oh, right.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12632","Ted","Wait a second. Wait a second, I got the angle.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12633","Abby","Sir, please don't yell at me, because when people yell at me, I have a tendency to start crying. Please don't do it.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12634","Stella","Abby, I've told you before.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12635","Abby","...Please...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12636","Stella","When they're rude to you, hang up the phone.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12637","Abby","...how difficult it is for me to...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12638","Stella","Go on, you can do this, hang up. Abby, hang it up.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12639","Abby","I am too busy to waste my time... (Abby finally hangs up)","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12640","Stella","I'm sorry, I just wish that some of the patients would be nicer to you.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12641","Ted","The receptionist. That's my way in.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12642","Barney","I like this. Seduce the receptionist. That's a great plan.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12643","Ted","That's not the plan. And how would that help me with Stella?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12644","Barney","Who?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12645","Ted","Here's the plan.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12646","Ted","Hi. Here. I stopped... (He takes the bag back and wait for stella to be able to see him to give it back to Abby) Hi, I stopped for coffee and I... and I thought I'd grab you something.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12647","Abby","Oh, wow, thank you, that's so nice. You're like a knight. I should call you Sir Ted.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12648","Ted","What?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12649","Abby","Nothing. Nothing. (laughs nervously) It's really stupid. (She calls Stella, who is standing right behind her) Um, Dr. Zinman, Ted's here.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12650","Stella","Thanks. Thanks, Abby.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12651","Ted","And now... we wait.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12652","Ted from 2030","And sure enough, by session seven, she saw me in a whole new light.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12653","Stella","Okay, I'm about to break my big rule here.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12654","Ted","Break it.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12655","Stella","Okay. Abby goes bowling with her church group every Wednesday nights...and she really wanted to invite you, but she's too shy.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12656","Ted","Abby is...?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12657","Stella","My receptionist. You really made quite an impression on her with the coffee the other day. I mean, she has really not stopped talking about you.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12658","Ted","Oh, Abby. I thought you said ""Alan.""","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12659","Stella","But you just said, ""Abby is...?""","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12660","Ted","Right. Right, I thought I said ""Alan.""","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12661","Stella","Who's Alan?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12662","Ted","Who's Abby?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12663","Stella","My receptionist.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12664","Ted","Exactly.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12665","Ted","What is happening?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12666","Lily","Ted. You just got to be yourself, no more gimmicks.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12667","Ted","You're right, no more gimmicks. One more gimmick.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12668","Ted","You know what's on her shelf? That self-help book 'The Power of Me'.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12669","Ted","I know, I know, but I thought if I read it, maybe we'd have something new to talk about.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12670","Marshall","It's actually a great book. It taught me the power of complete memory.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12671","Ted","Can I borrow your copy?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12672","Marshall","I left it somewhere... I forget.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12673","Ted","Hi. Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12674","Abby","Hi, Ted. I'll let her know.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12675","Ted","Telepathically?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12676","Abby, laughing","That's funny. That's funny, smart, and great.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12677","Stella","I am so sorry that I am late. I have, like, two minutes for lunch everyday.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12678","Ted","It's crazy. Yeah, I understand. I was just, uh, checking out the old bookshelf here. I see you've read 'The Power of Me'. It's funny...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12679","Stella","What? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, I would never read that piece of crap. Some patient left it here.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12680","Ted","Oh, thank God. (chuckling) I couldn't agree more. That's total crap. I see people reading that on the subway and I just want to shout, ""Get a life, people!""","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12681","Abby","Ted, I found your book.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12682","Ted","What?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12683","Abby","Your book 'The Power of Me'. I think you accidentally dropped it in the garbage.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12684","Ted","What? No, that's... that's not mine. I've never seen that before in my life.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12685","Abby","No, you were reading it in the lobby.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12686","Ted","Wha... no, you have me confused with someone else.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12687","Abby","No, no, look right here. ""From the personal library of Ted Mosby."" That's you.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12688","Robin","Ted, I hate to say this, but I think it's ""nail the receptionist"" time.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12689","Ted","I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12690","Barney","Ted, every little boy wants to grow up to nail the doctor or the lawyer. Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12691","Ted","No. I like Stella.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12692","Barney","Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, Ted. Your little Stella is not so perfect.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12693","Ted","What do you mean?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12694","Barney","I went down there and checked her out for myself. Yeah. And while I was down there, I discovered that she had a secret, a terrible... terrible secret.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12695","Ted","What? What is it?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12696","Barney","Hold on, I gotta pee. (He stands up et goes to the toilets) Okay, I'm back. What's going on at work?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12697","Ted","What's the big secret?!","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12698","Barney","Oh. Oh, right.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12699","Barney","Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12700","Abby","Sure, what's it regarding?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12701","Barney","Oh, I just want to see her. Want to look at her, see what she looks like.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12702","Abby","I-I don't understand.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12703","Barney","I'm sorry, did I accidentally oprima numero dos when I called? Do you speak English? I want to see her!","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12704","Abby","Sir, please don't yell at me because when people yell at me, I have a tendency to start crying.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12705","Barney","What are your credentials?!","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12706","Abby","Please don't do that. Please.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12707","Barney","I want to know who am I speaking with!","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12708","Barney","At first she seemed great, beautiful, smart, way out of your league. But then, I overheard this conversation.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12709","Stella","Oh, Abby, did my hypnotherapist call yet?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12710","Abby","No.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12711","Stella","When am I going to kick this folliculaphilia?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12712","Ted","Folliculaphilia?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12713","Barney","Folliculaphilia.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12714","Ted","What is that?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12715","Barney","Ted, your perfect woman can only be attracted to men with moustaches.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12716","Ted","That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. That's not real.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12717","Barney","You're right, Ted. I'm just making that up.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12718","Ted","I know that you are because there's no such thing.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12719","Robin","I got it a little bit.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12720","Ted","Hi. Uh, Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12721","Abby","Oh, hi, Ted. Love the 'stache. You look like a young Tom Selleck, only a million times handsomer. Dr. Zinman, Magnum's here to see you. Just kidding. Stupid.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12722","Stella","Sorry I'm late. Typical two-minute lunch. So we are very close to getting...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12723","Ted","Why? Just why?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12724","Barney","Y-you don't remember?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12725","Barney","I'll bet anyone ten bucks I can get Ted to grow a moustache.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12726","Ted","Uh... okay.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12727","Ted","You sabotaged my next to last chance with Stella for ten dollars?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12728","Barney","I know. I would've done it for free. But, no. You owe me ten bucks.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12729","Ted","This is awful. My-my tenth session is next week. I'm gonna ask her out, and she's gonna say the most demoralizing syllable in the English language... no. You know what? Just forget it. I'm not even gonna ask her.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12730","Lily","No, you have to. She likes you. She said so herself. (clearing throat) I mean...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12731","Ted","Oh, my God, you went and saw her, too.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12732","Lily","I swear to you, I did not.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12733","Marshall","My wife's always getting on me about my dry elbows. So good to be in a relationship. Anyone special in your life? Or maybe just someone you're interested in? Interes-ted in?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12734","Stella","You know, we should really get this mole checked out. It's just a little irregular.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12735","Marshall","Irregular? Oh, my God. This is it. It's all over.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12736","Stella","One of my patients has this little butterfly tattoo at the bottom of his back.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12737","Marshall","Can you stop talking about your other patients?! I'm dying here, woman!","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12738","Stella","There you go. Look, even if it is something, it's easily treatable, so try to relax.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12739","Marshall","Okay. Hey, what was it you were saying before about the guy with the butterfly tattoo?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12740","Stella","Oh, that... that's nothing. It's just a little crush. So I will be calling you with your results.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12741","Marshall","Oh. Okay. Thank you.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12742","Stella","Oh, sir, your book!","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12743","Ted","No.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12744","Marshall","Yes.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12745","Ted","She said ""crush""? And she was talking about me?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12746","Ted from 2030","That last session was the least painful of all. I savored every searing blast of that laser.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12747","Stella","All done.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12748","Ted from 2030","The moment I'd waited ten weeks for had arrived.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12749","Ted","Stella...now that I'm no longer your patient, would you like to have dinner with me?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12750","Stella","Ted, you're a really nice guy...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12751","Ted","Oh, no.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12752","Stella","It has been so great getting to know you.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12753","Ted","I am gonna kill Marshall.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12754","Stella","I've had so much fun these last ten weeks.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12755","Ted","Oh, my God, this is worse than the laser.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12756","Stella","I have a daughter.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12757","Ted","What?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12758","Stella","Her name's Lucy. She's eight. Work and being with her, that's pretty much my life. My social calendar is movie night with the girls once a month when I can get a sitter. I mean, I've been to one party in the past year... St. Paddy's Day... it was awful, I left early. But, really, my only free time is the two minutes I get for lunch, so... this is why I don't date. Ted, I only have time for one most important person in my life, and that's Lucy. Anyway, it's been fun. Next time, think before you ink. But if you ever do wake up with, like, a dolphin tattoo on your ankle, just give me a call.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12759","Ted","There it is... she's a mom. It's just not gonna happen.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12760","Marshall","Sorry, dude. Have a shrimp.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12761","Ted","I'm good. I guess I got no one but myself to blame. She told me right from the start she was gonna say no and sure enough... Wait a minute.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12762","Ted","You didn't actually say no.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12763","Stella","What do you mean?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12764","Ted","All this time you were, uh, you were supposed to say no, but you didn't... I checked the transcript. So, here's what I'm proposing. Uh... You only have two minutes, right?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12765","Stella","Right.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12766","Ted","Okay. You want to, uh... go on a a two-minute date with me?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12767","Stella","Last two-minute date I had gave me a daughter. Um... Okay.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12768","Ted","Great. And... go. Taxi!","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12769","Ranjit","Hello!","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12770","Stella","Ted, I seriously only have two minutes...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12771","Ted","I know.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12772","Stella","That's like 120 seconds.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12773","Ted","380 West 22nd, please. And step on it. We're in a hurry.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12774","Stella","380 West 22nd? That's...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12775","Ted","Right this way.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12776","Stella, laughing","Thank you, sir. You know, I have always wanted to try this place.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12777","Waitress","House salad.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12778","Ted","So, college?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12779","Stella","Stanford.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12780","Ted","Uh-huh. Wesleyan.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12781","Stella","Oh, good. Do you know Adam Lazar?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12782","Ted","No. Scott Crable?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12783","Waitress","Eggplant parmesean.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12784","Ted","Thanks.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12785","Stella","Oh, already cut up. Nice.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12786","Ted","Could we get the check please. We're trying to make a movie in 15 seconds.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12787","Waitress","Of course.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12788","Ted","Okay, great. Uh, how do you want to do this? You had the eggplant parm. I only really had water so... I'm kidding. Oh. Okay. Let's go. Taxi! You nervous?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12789","Stella","A little bit.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12790","Ted","You can't tell at all.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12791","Stella","Oh, good. Yeah.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12792","Ranjit","Hello!","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12793","Ted","384 West 22nd.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12794","Stella","15 seconds. The movie's started.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12795","Ted","Nah, previews. We'll be fine. Ah! Just in time. It hasn't started yet.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12796","Stella","So, what are we seeing?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12797","Ted","Manos  Hands of Fate.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12798","Stella","The whole thing?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12799","Ted","Only the important parts. Worst movie ever.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12800","Stella","Yeah, I almost walked out, like, five times.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12801","Ted","How we doing on time? Taxi!","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12802","Stella","We got a little time.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12803","Ted","Okay. Do you want to walk it?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12804","Stella","Why not?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12805","Ranjit","Hello! Good-bye!","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12806","Ted","So what grade's your daughter in?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12807","Stella","Third grade.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12808","Ted","Ah! That's a good year.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12809","Stella","Yeah, she's wonderful. I just wish that I could get her to quit smoking, you know?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12810","Ted","What?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12811","Stella","I'm kidding.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12812","Ted","Oh. Look, coffee and dessert?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12813","Stella","You know, this neighborhood just keeps on changing. This used to be a cute, little Italian restaurant.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12814","Ted","I know. New York. It's a living organism, an ever-changing tapestry. Ooh, look at the time. Let's go.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12815","Stella","Mmm, the cheesecake's amazing.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12816","Ted","Flowers?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12817","Stella","I'm allergic.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12818","Ted","Okay. See? We're getting to know each other. Stella, I had a lovely... Doggy bag? Stella, I had a lovely time.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12819","Stella","Me, too, Ted.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12820","Ted","And... date.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12821","Stella","Huh?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12822","Ted","That wasn't so bad, right? No lengthy, awkward silences. Dessert ran a little long, so... I had to cut the good-night kiss.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12823","Stella","I think I can be late just once. (They kiss) Ted...","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12824","Ted","Look, I would love to have a second date, I would. But I understand that you really don't have time right now, but if you ever do, will you give me a call?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12825","Stella","Yes.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12826","Ted","Okay.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12827","Ted from 2030","And that, kids, is how you turn a ""no"" into a ""yes.""","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12828","Abby","All my friends told me, ""Abby, be strong. He doesn't deserve another chance."" But I forgive you! (She runs after Ted)","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12829","Ted","No, no, no, no!","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12830","Abby","...then he just kept toying with my emotions.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12831","Barney","Wow. This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk. You know your problem? You're too sweet.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12832","Abby","Aren't you going to see the doctor about that mole?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12833","Barney","Oh, yeah. Turns out it's just a Raisinet. Hey, how would you like me to take you out to a fancy restaurant and then go on a shopping spree? Treat you the way you should be treated. Would that make you forget about that Ted monster?","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12834","Abby","My mom was wrong. There are nice guys in New York.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12835","Barney","We just have to go by my hotel room first. My bed was broken. I just have to make sure they fixed it.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12836","Abby","Well, then if it's fixed, can we can have s*x on it and then go shopping.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12837","Barney","I like you.","03","13","Ten Sessions"
"12838","Ted from 2030","Kids,back when we were younger, your Uncle Marshall and I were really into college basketball. Every year,March Madness would take over the entire apartment.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12839","Robin","Hey.What's with the blackboard?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12840","Ted","It's our NCAA bracket.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12841","Marshall","Big board equals big luck!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12842","Lily","Hey, that looks familiar, where did you get it?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12843","Marshall","Hello. Uh, I'm looking for my wife, Ms.Aldrin.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12844","Cleaner","There's no school today. It's Saturday.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12845","Marshall","Of course. How could I forget?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12846","Cleaner","Dumb ass.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12847","Ted","Big board!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12848","Marshall","Big luck!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12849","Marshall","We found it. No big deal. Anyway, every year, Ted and I go in together on this big money pool out in Staten Island.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12850","Ted","Yeah. The winner gets $100,000 stuffed in a duffel bag.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12851","Marshall","And you get to keep the duffel bag.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12852","Lily","Why do you guys put yourselves through this? You lose every year.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12853","Ted","That's because in the past, we were just guessing. This year, we watched every game, read box scores, tracked injuries. This isn't March Madness. This is March Meticulously Thought-outness.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12854","Barney","Your team lost 20 minutes ago.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12855","Ted","I didn't know they were playing today.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12856","Lily","You okay, Barney?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12857","Barney","Something strange is going on. I was down at the hardware store trying to get a little somethin' somethin'.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12858","Robin","Wait. You go to the hardware store to pick up girls?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12859","Barney","There are four kinds of women who go to the hardware store by themselves.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12860","Robin","Of course there are.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12861","Barney","Single, recently single, recently divorced, lesbian who will let me watch.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12862","Lily","You could not be more evil.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12863","Barney","Sorry. Five. Recently widowed. So, I'm talking to this girl...","03","14","The Bracket"
"12864","Barney","Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12865","Barney","I was only gone for a second when...","03","14","The Bracket"
"12866","Barney","See? Skid-proof.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12867","Barney","The same thing happened at the pet store yesterday.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12868","Marshall","Pet store?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12869","Ted","Single girl, mid-twenties, looking for a canine replacement for the boyfriend who just dumped her. Instead, finds Barney.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12870","Barney","God bless you, Ted. You're reading my blog.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12871","Ted","I'm really bored at work.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12872","Barney","I'd call your ex a dog, but that would be an insult to little Ladybug here.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12873","Woman","Oh, I want to take her home right now.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12874","Barney","Not without a chew toy from Uncle Barney first. And when I got back... I'm sorry,I'm already spoiling her but diamond in the rough... Could your heart just melt?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12875","Woman, slapping him","Jerk!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12876","Barney","Weird, right? Yeah. The same thing happened last week at the museum.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12877","Lily","Ooh, ooh, ooh!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12878","Barney","Lily.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12879","Lily","You pretend to be a struggling young artist who needs a new muse.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12880","Barney","No. Marshall.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12881","Marshall","You're a millionaire art thief casing the joint for a thrill money can no longer give you!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12882","Barney","Oh. No. Robin.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12883","Robin","You're going blind, and you're trying to soak up all the beauty in the world before the darkness descends.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12884","Barney","Bingo! So, I was talking to this girl...","03","14","The Bracket"
"12885","Barney","At this point, about 83%. Soon, these audio guides will be all that I have left.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12886","Woman","I'm so sorry.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12887","Barney","My God, you are beautiful. How about I get you a headset so you can see with your ears like I do? I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds, but when I came back... Hmm.You know, I also love the smell of great art.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12888","Barney","Why does this keep happening?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12889","Lily","Maybe you're not as good a liar as you think you are.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12890","Barney","Oh, really? Then why am I not in prison for perjury? But I don't want to talk about work. Something weird is going on here.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12891","Ted from 2030","But the next night got even weirder.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12892","Barney","Alan Alda. It was Alan Alda.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12893","Lily","You never gonna believe what just happened.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12894","Barney","Who was that, um, guy from Mash? The main guy. What...? Hawkeye from Mash. How can I be blanking on this?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12895","Lily","Alan Alda?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12896","Barney","No.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12897","Mystery woman","Hey, a word of advice? That guy you were talking to, Barney Stinson... I know he seems charming, but he's just saying whatever it takes to get in your pants. Sleeping with Barney was the biggest mistake of my life.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12898","Barney","Oh, my God. Where is she?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12899","Lily","She must have left. She...","03","14","The Bracket"
"12900","Barney","Well, she-she said I hooked up with her? What was her name? What did she look like?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12901","Lily","She didn't say her name, but she had blonde hair, boobs. Kind of trashy.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12902","Barney","Dead in the eyes with an aura of self-loathing and despair?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12903","Lily","Yes!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12904","Barney","That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12905","Barney","Some woman that I slept with and screwed over is trying to ruin my life. God, why is this happening to me?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12906","Lily","It's karma.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12907","Barney","Nah, it's not Karma. She's stripping in Vegas. Plus, we're good.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12908","Ted","Look, if you want to figure out who it is, why don't you just start by checking your list?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12909","Barney","My list? Dude, do not pretend you're not the kind of guy who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12910","Marshall","I have one. It's called my marriage license.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12911","Ted","Come on, let's see the list.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12912","Barney","Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12913","Barney","This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with. I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th. Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you. What do you think, Lil? You recognize the saboteur?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12914","Lily","I don't know, Barney. I only saw her face.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12915","Ted","How many of these girls know they're being photographed?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12916","Barney","All of them, but only about half buy a copy on the way out.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12917","Lily","Oh, Barney, you're never gonna figure out which one of these is the mystery woman. All of these women have a right to hate you.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12918","Robin","Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up. I mean, any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney and do this or that, or this and that, or do this with those in that... I mean, she should have known what she was getting into.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12919","Barney","Absolutely. And what I do with these women should be between me and them. And you guys. And Heloise. She helped me do the decoupage.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12920","Lily","I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12921","Barney","This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12922","Barney","The top 64 women I've slept with, split into four regions. This tournament will systematically narrow down which girl has the most cause to hate my guts. Last girl standing has to be the saboteur.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12923","Lily","Absolutely not, Barney. We are not going to make a game out of the women you've tricked into sleeping with you. No way!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12924","Lily","The girl who thought he had 12 hours to live has way more cause to ruin his life than the girl he faked proposed to.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12925","Robin","It's fake proposal girl. I mean, she hired a wedding planner!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12926","Ted","It's 12 hours to live! That girl flew them both to Paris!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12927","Robin","Oh, she only bought him a one-way ticket!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12928","Barney","Okay, okay, everybody! Hands.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12929","Marshal, Lily and Ted","12 hours to live!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12930","Robin","Damn it!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12931","Barney","Okay, toss up. ""Thought I was Jorge Posada,"" or ""You have my dead wife's kidney?""","03","14","The Bracket"
"12932","Ted","Kidney!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12933","Robin","Jorge Posada!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12934","Lily","She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12935","Barney","That's true...","03","14","The Bracket"
"12936","Marshall","It's ""Dead wife's kidney."" How are we even discussing this?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12937","Lily","Fake baby!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12938","Marshall","Lost at sea!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12939","Ted","Fake baby!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12940","Marshall","Lost at sea!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12941","Ted","I was there. Trust me. It's fake baby.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12942","Barney","Down to the sweet 16. And coming out of the Upper West Side, we have the number three seed, ""Girl who thought I owned Google,"" up against the number seven seed, ""Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor.""","03","14","The Bracket"
"12943","Ted","You got to go scuba instructor.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12944","Robin","You're kidding me!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12945","Ted","She got the bends!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12946","Barney","Yeah, she did.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12947","Marshall","Evil twin!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12948","Ted","Prince of Norway! How could it not be Prince of Norway?!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12949","Robin","Barney, you're the tiebreaker.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12950","Barney","I'm going with Evil Twin.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12951","Ted","You're kidding me!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12952","Barney","Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl twice. As Barney and Larney. Okay, we're down to the Final Four. What do you think, people? Come on, dig deep.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12953","Robin","Oh! I can't decide. It could be any one of them.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12954","Lily","Is that the blackboard from my classroom?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12955","Barney","Come on! Marshall?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12956","Marshall","I'm tired and sad.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12957","Barney","Mosby?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12958","Ted","I want to call my mom, just tell her I love her.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12959","Barney","Okay. Then this is as far as we get. The Final Four. It's got to be Meg, Anna, Kate or Holly. We are gonna track these girls down, and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12960","Lily","You guys stole my blackboard!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12961","Barney","Okay, there's her building. When she comes out, I'm gonna hide, and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar, we run like hell.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12962","Lily","No.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12963","Barney","What do you mean ""no""?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12964","Lily","That woman, like every woman in your Final Four, deserves an apology, and I'm not telling you if she's the one until hear you say, ""I'm sorry.""","03","14","The Bracket"
"12965","Barney","Are you nuts? That would involve me speaking to a woman I've already had s*x with, which, frankly, is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12966","Lily","Barney, you're doing this.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12967","Barney","Lily, this girl hates me. I hooked up with her in an apartment I was pretending was my own, told her I loved her, and then ditched her there. She got arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail. Oh, crap, there she is! If she sees me, she's gonna kill me!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12968","Lily","Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Hey, Meg! Over here! Look who it is! Yo old friend Meg  Barney! Barney?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12969","Barney","If she kills me, I want you to go into my apartment, grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the East River.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12970","Meg","What are you doing here?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12971","Barney","Look, Meg, we need to talk.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12972","Meg","It was all my fault. I know it was, baby. I just came on too strong.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12973","Barney","And I forgive you. I love you.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12974","Meg","Oh, my God! I love you, too!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12975","Lily","No! What's the matter with you? Get off of him! Look, she's not the one, but you still owe her an apol...","03","14","The Bracket"
"12976","Barney","So you remember who this one is, right?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12977","Lily","Yes. You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12978","Barney","Right, and if you recall, her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I...","03","14","The Bracket"
"12979","Lily","Yeah, I know, Barney, you showed me. And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present. So go over there and apologize.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12980","Barney","Ah, there she is.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12981","Lily","Ooh and she's holding hot coffee. Maybe she'll throw it in your face.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12982","Barney","You're really enjoying this, aren't you?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12983","Lily","I'm making a scrapbook.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12984","Barney","Anna, hi.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12985","Anna","Look who it is, Mr. Big Shot Architect. If you're here to ask me to take down the Web site, forget it.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12986","Barney","What Web site?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12987","Anna","Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12988","Barney","You're right, I do deserve that. That's all I came here to say. You know what? I don't care who knows about it. Excuse me. Excuse me. I, Ted Mosby, am a jerk to women. Tell your sisters. Tell your daughters to stay away! Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12989","Ted from 2030","And that little Web site went on to get 400,000 hits. Thanks, Barney!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12990","Lily","Okay, which one is this again?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12991","Barney","She's...","03","14","The Bracket"
"12992","Kate","Larney! Die!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12993","Barney","Is it her?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12994","Kate","Die!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12995","Lily","Smile.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12996","Barney","You look good. Have you lost weight?","03","14","The Bracket"
"12997","Barney","We're down to the number one seed. I knew it was Holly. It had to be Holly. Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly.","03","14","The Bracket"
"12998","Holly","Barney, did you hear that? Somebody's stealing my truck. Barney? Barney!","03","14","The Bracket"
"12999","Lily","That is the worst thing you've ever done. That's the worst thing anyone has ever done.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13000","Barney","But in my defense, she was kind of annoying.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13001","Lily","She's gonna kill you.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13002","Holly","Barney.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13003","Barney","Holly.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13004","Holly","Mark, come over here. Barney, this is my fiancé. Mark.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13005","Mark","Barney? You're the Barney who ditched her in the woods?","03","14","The Bracket"
"13006","Lily","So you're not mad at Barney? Don't you want an apology? An admission of guilt? Your truck back?","03","14","The Bracket"
"13007","Holly","No, whatever happened was in the past. Mark is my present and my future.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13008","Mark","And if you ditching Holly in the woods made her stop running around with guys like you, then cheers.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13009","Barney","Well then, to the last Fourth of July weekend I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13010","Mark","Fourth of July? We started dating in June.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13011","Lily","We ruined their lives. And the worst part of it is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13012","Barney","No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13013","Robin","Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13014","Barney","That's not a bad idea.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13015","Robin","I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13016","Ted","I don't know. That's a lot riding on a girl who giggles when she lies.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13017","Robin","I do not.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13018","Ted","Have you ever fallen asleep while eating ribs?","03","14","The Bracket"
"13019","Robin","No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13020","Barney","I'm in.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13021","Robin","Okay, here's how it's gonna work. Now, Lily...","03","14","The Bracket"
"13022","Robin","...she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13023","Barney","Talking, we should be talking. Words. Here are words. Why is this so hard? Laughter!","03","14","The Bracket"
"13024","Robin","And then I'll come in, looking hot as all hell.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13025","Man","Wow, you are gorgeous. Oh, God, I know that's awful.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13026","Robin","I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13027","Barney","Hey, there, how are you doing?","03","14","The Bracket"
"13028","Robin","Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13029","Barney","Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?","03","14","The Bracket"
"13030","Robin","Get your hand off my thigh, Barney.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13031","Barney","It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13032","Robin","You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?","03","14","The Bracket"
"13033","Barney","Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?","03","14","The Bracket"
"13034","Robin","No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13035","Barney","Uh, I'm going to go to the bathroom now, but, uh, when I come back we'll go to my place and have s*x.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13036","Ted","Dude, dude, dude, look. Blonde girl heading over to Robin right now. We are go.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13037","Marshall","I don't know what to do with my hands. What do I normally do with my hands? (Barney joins them at the booth) Barney. I brought a copy of the bracket. Which one is she?","03","14","The Bracket"
"13038","Barney","I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13039","Marshall","Not even on bracket. Cinderella story comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing. That'll warm your heart.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13040","Ted","Are you okay?","03","14","The Bracket"
"13041","Barney","I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13042","Lily","Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13043","Barney","What? What?","03","14","The Bracket"
"13044","Robin","Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13045","Barney","So I apologized for nothing?","03","14","The Bracket"
"13046","Lily","Yes, but it was a great apology. And a perfect way to end my scrapbook. I'm going to call this photo ""Barney's Redemption."" Could you stop giving me the finger?","03","14","The Bracket"
"13047","Ted from 2030","Eventually, Barney did figure out who the mysterious girl was. But we on that later.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13048","Woman","Barney, come back to bed. You have a shuttle launch tomorrow. And that asteroid that's headed for Manhattan, It's not gonna destroy itself.","03","14","The Bracket"
"13049","Ted from 2030","Kids,the spring of 2008 was a pretty great time for me. Stella and I had started dating, and I'd just gotten a big raise at work. So I decided to purchase something I knew would be the envy of all my friends.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13050","Ted","A new car!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13051","Barney","Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13052","Robin","You can't call shotgun for eternity.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13053","Barney","I just called it.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13054","Robin","You can't just call things, barney.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13055","Barney","I call that I can call things!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13056","Lily","Hey, baby.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13057","Marshall","Beer.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13058","Lily","Are you okay?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13059","Marshall","Beer.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13060","Ted","Okay, what happened?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13061","Marshall","They always told me that working at a big law firm was like being at war...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13062","Marshall","...You get out of law school, it's like getting out of boot camp. That first day at work, you're storming the beaches, full of piss and vinegar...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13063","Man","Dude, we're lawyers now.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13064","Marshall","Totally.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13065","Man","We've got briefcases and everything.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13066","Marshall","Freakin' briefcases.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13067","Man","You have anything in yours?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13068","Marshall","Totally empty. you?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13069","Man","Candy bars.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13070","Marshall","Then you get in the trenches side by side with your buddies. And you feel a sense of camaraderie. But before too long...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13071","Arthur","Hey, Marshall....","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13072","Marshall","...the shells start to fall. Hello, Arthur.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13073","Marshall","Arthur Hobbes is one of the senior partners at my firm, and he's... he's my boss. He seems like a nice guy, but he's got a nickname... Artillery arthur.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13074","Arthur","How's your morning going?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13075","Marshall","It's going fine. How is yours?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13076","Arthur","Not too bad, not too bad. Hey, is Ferguson in yet?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13077","Marshall","He is, he's in... just in his office next door.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13078","Arthur","That's great... have a good one, buddy.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13079","Marshall","You, too. (Arthur leaves Marshall's office) You never know who's gonna get hit...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13080","Arthur","Hey, Ferguson! I read your report, and it's complete crap! No, you know what? That's an insult to crap. If crap could eat and then crap stuff out, it's that! Your report is the crap that crap craps! If you last two more days here, I'll be shocked! Shocked!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13081","Marshall","It was brutal, But the worst was a few minutes later.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13082","Ferguson","Did you hear that?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13083","Marshall","Yeah, sorry.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13084","Ferguson","Can you believe he did that On ""Take-your-daughter-to-work"" day?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13085","Marshall","So that brings us to today. A little background. So I'm working on this report called ""Using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent to contest a class certification order based on a lack of commonality, numerosity...""","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13086","Ted","Dude, you lost us. Can't you just call it something cool like ""the ninja report""?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13087","Marshall","Okay. yeah, fine, whatever. Um, so I'm supposed to turn in ""the ninja report"" yesterday. But I got insanely busy with other stuff, I didn't get a chance to finish it, and then this morning...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13088","Arthur","Hey, Ferguson.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13089","Ferguson","Hey, Arthur.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13090","Arthur","How's your day going?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13091","Marshall","I gotta go.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13092","Ferguson","Great. how is yours?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13093","Arthur","Great, great... Hey, is Marshall in yet?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13094","Ferguson","Oh, thank god. Yeah, he's right in there.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13095","Arthur","Fantastic. have a good one, buddy.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13096","Marshall","And then...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13097","Marshall","He screamed at me.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13098","Lily","Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13099","Barney","What, that's it? You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13100","Marshall","Barney, I have never been screamed at like that in my life.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13101","Ted","Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13102","Barney","I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13103","Lily","Oh, baby, it's just not fair. You've been working so hard. Late nights, weekends. I never see you. We've barely made love in weeks. It's bad, guys, mama needs her sugar.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13104","Robin","Look, Marshall, he screamed at you, you took it. He probably respects you more for it.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13105","Marshall","Yeah, about that... So Arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment... Face turning red, vein in his forehead about to burst, spittle flying like shrapnel. Everyone you work with walking by your office, peering in. And suddenly, I just felt all of it.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13106","Ted","All of what?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13107","Marshall","All of it. The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment, and now I'm working for the bad guys instead. The fact that I am stuck in this job because of a mortgage I can barely afford on an apartment that is crooked. The fact that I am a grown man, and nobody, not even Artillery Arthur, has the right to talk to me like that!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13108","Marshall","I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13109","Barney","Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13110","Barney","Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13111","Marshall","I don't know what happened. There's just something about being yelled at like that, like I was being scolded by my dad. Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13112","Robin","Is ""boy"" the right word?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13113","Marshall","I felt absolutely powerless. Flaccid... Hell, I... I felt castrated.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13114","Lily","God, you're hot right now.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13115","Marshall","And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13116","Barney","Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13117","Marshall","How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13118","Robin","Here's what I would do if I were you.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13119","Robin","Hi, Arthur.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13120","Arthur","Hello, Marshall. Have you finally finished the ninja report?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13121","Robin","Yeah, I got it. Right here. I think it's gonna blow you away.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13122","Arthur","Please, I have a family.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13123","Robin","So we good?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13124","Arthur","We're so good.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13125","Robin","Then why are you still in my office?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13126","Ted","Okay, gun violence might be the answer to everything up in Canada, Robin, but here in America, we solve our problems with words. Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy with a big eloquent speech defending human dignity. Like abraham Lincoln.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13127","Marshall","Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big, eloquent speech off the top of your head.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13128","Ted","Observe.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13129","Ted","Arthur?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13130","Arthur","What do you want, Marshall?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13131","Ted","Justice, sir. You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights, the most fundamentally paramount of which is the right... Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount. One means highest, one means lowest.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13132","Arthur","You are nailing this.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13133","Ted","Human beings have rights, and those rights are, um...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13134","Arthur","You got me hooked, reel me in.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13135","Ted","There are certain justices that cannot or will not be inalienable... as such... for the future.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13136","Arthur","Stuck the landing... bravo! Thank you. Security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13137","Marshall","Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay? I can't have some big confrontation with Arthur. I need this job, i... I need the money.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13138","Ted","Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow, tell him off and then quit?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13139","Marshall","It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13140","Barney","Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13141","Barney","Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13142","Bilson","You made yourself look bad, you made this company look bad, and quite frankly, you made our friends, the North Koreans, look bad! And I'll tell you something else, Blauman, if you think for one moment...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13143","Blauman","You know what, Bilson? You can kiss my ass.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13144","Barney","Oh, snap.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13145","Bilson","What?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13146","Blauman","You heard me. I don't need to take your crap anymore. My cousin's website went public today, and I made a pile of money on the ipo, so you know what I think Of this whole damn company?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13147","Ted","Oh, my God.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13148","Marshall","He peed on the conference table?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13149","Blauman","Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second till I get started? Come on. Come on.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13150","Barney, pouring some water in a glass","Does this help?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13151","Barney","Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website tanked. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13152","Marshall","That's it? that's the end of the story?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13153","Barney","No, no, of course not... he died.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13154","Marshall","How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13155","Barney","Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13156","Marshall","Chain of screaming?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13157","Barney","Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13158","Ted","I thought it was a chain of screaming.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13159","Barney","It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13160","Marshall","I don't scream at Lily.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13161","Lily","And I don't scream at my kids, none of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13162","Robin","So it's not a circle.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13163","Barney","Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13164","Marshall","Lily, I need your take on this. What... what should I do?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13165","Lily","Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13166","Barney","Oh, God.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13167","Lily","...When dealing with a bully, the most important thing is to be constructive and positive.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13168","Lily","Hello, Arthur.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13169","Arthur","Hello, Marshall.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13170","Lily","I have the ninja report right here. But Arthur, in the future, if you want someone to do their best work, try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation, but through encouragement, inspiration and respect.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13171","Arthur","Well said, Marshall, I needed to hear that. By the way, I saw your wife's picture in your office. That is one tasty slice.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13172","Lily","Oh, you're damn right. You know what I'm gonna do when I get home?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13173","Arthur","Oh, yeah.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13174","Lily","I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13175","Arthur","That's it.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13176","Lily","...just throw her on the bed...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13177","Arthur","That's where she belongs.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13178","Lily","...and drive her home like a pack of sled dogs!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13179","Lily","It's bad, guys. Mama needs it bad.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13180","Marshall","You're right, baby, it's about respect. That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight. Can you give me that speech again?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13181","Lily","I'm gonna drive her home like a pack of...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13182","Marshall","No, the other part, please.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13183","Lily","I have the ninja report right here, but...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13184","Ted from 2030","And it seemed like that was the end of it, but it wasn't, because the next night...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13185","Lily","Which of these carpets would look better in the new apartment? I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft. It would feel great on your bare feet......or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat rolling down your trembling bosom.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13186","Ted","Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13187","Marshall","Shh, don't say my name. Lily can't know it's me. Just pretend you're talking to Stella. Be all lovey dovey.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13188","Ted","Hey, Stella. Sweetie, how's it going?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13189","Marshall","Not good, not good at all.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13190","Ted","Where are you right now?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13191","Marshall","Right downstairs, come find me. Without Lily.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13192","Ted","Okay, I'll see you soon.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13193","Marshall","I love you.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13194","Ted","I love you, too.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13195","Lily","Wow, you two are already saying the ""l"" word, huh?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13196","Ted","Apparently.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13197","Lily","You hitting that?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13198","Marshall","I'm in trouble, Ted. Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13199","Ted","Um... it's a new car, so just be careful...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13200","Marshall","I did something stupid, can we just drive somewhere? I need to get away... just drive, man. Please just drive.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13201","Ted","It's just, this is a really good parking spot.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13202","Marshall","Dude!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13203","Ted","Look, just tell me what happened first.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13204","Marshall","Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech that Lily told me to give, be firm but respectful? Well, it didn't totally go that way.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13205","Ted","There is a lot of ketchup on that burger. Sorry, what happened?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13206","Marshall","After we all finished talking last night, I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13207","Barney","Hey, marshall.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13208","Marshall","How long have you been sitting there?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13209","Barney","If you go in there with Lily's kindergarten nonsense, you're gonna get torn apart. I'm here to save your life. you hungry?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13210","Marshall","Yeah, I was just about to order.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13211","Barney","What do you want?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13212","Marshall","A sandwich and gravy fries.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13213","Waiter","Okay, friends, what do you like?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13214","Barney","A green tea with lemon for me, and for my friend here, the meatloaf, please.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13215","Waiter","Very good.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13216","Marshall","No, I didn't want meatloaf.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13217","Barney","Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13218","Marshall","No, I don't.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13219","Barney","Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13220","Marshall","Who would I even scream at?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13221","Barney","I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13222","Marshall","No.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13223","Robin","Hey, I was just heading to the bar. What are you guys doing out here?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13224","Marshall","Oh, I was just telling Ted a story.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13225","Robin","Ooh, I like stories. You want a lick? What?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13226","Ted","Is that ice cream cone big enough?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13227","Robin","Uh, it's delicious enough.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13228","Marshall","Okay, so... Then I say to Barney...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13229","Marshall","I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13230","Barney","Yes, you are. That waiter is every boss and every bully who ever embarrassed or belittled you. And how dare he deny you the one thing that you want, that would make you happy at this moment. A sandwich and gravy fries.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13231","Waiter","One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf. Enjoy, my friends.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13232","Barney","Marshall.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13233","Marshall","Excuse me?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13234","Waiter","Yes?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13235","Marshall","This is not what I ordered.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13236","Waiter","Yes, it is.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13237","Marshall","I beg your pardon, sir, But I ordered a sandwich and gravy fries, And as the customer, I'm always right, so...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13238","Waiter","No, no, I am not going to stand here and take this! I am at the end of a triple shift... that's 18 hours!... And then I have to take two trains and a bus to astoria to have my wife scream at me because I'm never home. No, no, you eat your damn meatloaf!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13239","Barney","Hey, what are you guys doing out here?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13240","Robin","Oh sweet, can I get a toot?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13241","Ted","Uh-uh. against car rules, it's against car rules!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13242","Barney","Oh, Ted, relax, it's Cuban. People pay to have their car smell like this.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13243","Ted","Well, that's just not true.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13244","Barney","Oh, Marshall, switch seats with me. I called shotgun for all eternity.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13245","Robin","You can't call shotgun for eternity.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13246","Barney","Well, that's funny, cause I did!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13247","Robin","It's case by case.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13248","Marshall","Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13249","Barney","A 20% tip, really, for that waiter?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13250","Marshall","I don't know, Barney, he worked a triple, it just...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13251","Barney","I can't believe it! If you're not gonna yell at the waiter, Yell at me.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13252","Marshall","What?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13253","Barney","Yell at me.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13254","Marshall","I'm not gonna yell at you, Barney.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13255","Barney","What, you think you're gonna upset me? Please, give me your best shot.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13256","Marshall","Okay, fine... what, you want me to yell at you?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13257","Barney","Yeah.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13258","Marshall","This is me yelling at you, Barney.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13259","Barney","I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly landing on a leaf about three blocks away.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13260","Marshall","This is me yelling at you, Barney!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13261","Barney","Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content. Make it hurt.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13262","Marshall","You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13263","Barney","No, something that's true-- come on. The man made you cry. Make me cry.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13264","Marshall","Your mom's a slut!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13265","Barney","Yes.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13266","Marshall","Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, Barney, but you and your brother clearly have different fathers, And you know why? It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13267","Barney","Keep going.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13268","Marshall","I don't care what you say. Bob Barker is not your father!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13269","Barney","Okay, now, well, that's just not cool.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13270","Marshall","Oh my god, Barney, I'm so sorry...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13271","Barney","No, I'm kidding... keep going.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13272","Marshall","Bob Barker's not your father! You've concocted this delusional idea that a game show host is your real father, and he's not! You were abandoned, Barney! You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it, and so now you never allow yourself to feel anything, and that's how you survive in this corporate world, and if I keep heading down this path, I'm gonna turn into you! And I don't want that! I don't want any of this! This is not why I became a lawyer. This is not the person that I wanted to be...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13273","Marshall","... I quit, Arthur! I quit!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13274","Arthur","Well, thank you, Eriksen, I needed to hear that.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13275","Marshall","Really, 'cause I didn't mean to attack you personally, It's just that i...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13276","Arthur","No, no, no, the part where you said, ""I quit."" Now we don't have to pay you a severance package. Uh, security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13277","Ted","Robin, you dropped a little ice cream...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13278","Marshall","Dude!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13279","Ted","I'm sorry.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13280","Barney","Don't blame this on me, Marshall. I told you to yell at someone beneath you. The circle of screaming is... The chain of scr... Pyramid... the pyramid of screaming! The pyramid of screaming.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13281","Marshall","How am I supposed to tell lily? She supported me through three years of law school, and now is the time when I'm supposed to pay her back. Now we're gonna lose the apartment. The place where we were gonna raise our children. How am I supposed to tell the person who I love more than anything in this world that I've just thrown away our future?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13282","Ted","Everybody out, everybody out of the new car! Out of the new car!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13283","Barney","Ted, screaming never solves anything.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13284","Ted from 2030","And so marshall finally had to tell lily what happened.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13285","Marshall","I'm so sorry. I just lost it. But I can fix it. First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go in there on my hands and knees and beg for my job back.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13286","Lily","No, you're not.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13287","Marshall","What?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13288","Lily","Marshall, our future isn't money or an apartment. And it's definitely not you being miserable at that horrible job. I'm just happy to have my husband back. We'll figure the rest out.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13289","Marshall","I love you.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13290","Lily","I love you, too.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13291","Ted from 2030","Ultimately, they were able to make ends meet without going bust on the apartment.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13292","Marshall","You sure about this?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13293","Ted","Yeah, who needs a car in new york city, right?","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13294","Marshall","Ted, I don't think I can accept...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13295","Ted","Marshall, don't make me scream at you.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13296","Marshall","Thanks a lot, buddy.","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13297","Ted","You guys did it in the car, didn't...","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13298","Marshall","Oh, yeah!","03","15","The Chain of Screaming"
"13299","Ted from 2030","Now kids, When aunt Robin was the teenager. She was, well, the Canadian pop star. But by 2008, she was the entirely different person.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13300","Robin","Coming up next, 'Is your baby trying to kill you?'","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13301","Ted from 2030","Which maybe events that week, all the more surprising.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13302","Ted","So, I got up this morning, its freezing. So I walked over there. And I don't know why I am still talking. Because clearly we are all asking the same question. What in God's creation is going on with Robin's breasts.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13303","Robin","I know, right, isn't that amazing? I spent half an hour making these happen. Its tape in there, cotton balls, half of a Nerf football, but it works, right?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13304","Lily","Totally. What's the occasion?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13305","Robin","And old friend from Canada is in town and I'm meeting him for a drink.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13306","Barney","Ooh! Somebody you went to Degrassi with?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13307","Robin","No. Actually, he was my first boyfriend.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13308","Robin","Simon. I thought he was the coolest guy ever. He smelled like Drakkar. He could ollie on a skateboard. He had the most amazing collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. We spent the whole summer madly in love.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13309","Barney","Tell me more. Tell me more. Like, did he have a car?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13310","Marshall","So he's the guy who... How shall I say this like a gentleman? Robin, did he take your maple leaf?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13311","Robin","No, it wasn't like that.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13312","Barney","Sounds to me like he gave you your first ""O, Canada!"" face.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13313","Ted from 2030","This went on for a really long time. Some of them jokes were elegant and well-crafted...","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13314","Lily","Wait, wait. Did he break up with you and tell you he's just not that Inuit?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13315","Ted from 2030","...others were crude, and ill-formed...","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13316","Ted","Um, something about fur trapping.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13317","Ted from 2030","...and others were obvious, but needed to be said...","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13318","Barney","Did you ride his Zamboni?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13319","Marshall","Wait, wait, wait. Did he...? I think I'm out.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13320","Ted","Yeah, I'm also ""oot. Okay, now I'm really out.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13321","Robin","Well, I'm sorry, guys. It was all very tame. We only dated for a week and a half.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13322","Barney","Wha...? I thought you said you were together all summer.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13323","Robin","Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty much the last week of July. Anyway, one night, his band just finish playing this gig...","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13324","Robin","Oh, my God! Simon. That was such a good show. You guys totally rocked out.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13325","Simon","Yeah. I know. I figure we're about four or five gigs away from really exploding. We're gonna be big, babe. I mean, like Crash-Test-Dummies big. So, that everything? All right. Listen, babe... It's over.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13326","Robin","What?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13327","Simon","I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13328","Lily","Louise Marsh?! That's a whore's name if I ever heard one.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13329","Marshall","Yeah, why would he want to get back together with Louise Marsh?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13330","Simon","Well, the thing is... her folks just put in a pool.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13331","Robin","Oh... So... I totally... I get it. Pools are great. Swimming's awesome. We have a sprinkler. Run right through it. Well, I should go.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13332","Simon","Uh... Babe, wait.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13333","Robin","Yeah, Simon?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13334","Simon","You forgot to load the drum set.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13335","Ted","No! Tell me you did not load the drum set.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13336","Robin","I did.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13337","Marshall","And now he's coming here? Robin, why do you want to see this guy?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13338","Lily","Oh! I know why. You're gonna win, aren't you?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13339","Robin","I have no idea what you' talking about.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13340","Ted","Yes, you do. Whenever you haven't seen someone for a long time, no matter how much you want to deny it, there's always a clear winner and a clear loser.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13341","Robin","Well, since you brought it up, let's add up the points.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13342","Barney","You're starting out with two big ones right there.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13343","Robin","Thank you. Okay. So, Simon still lives with his mom.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13344","Ted","Point Robin.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13345","Robin","Um, he never became a rock star.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13346","Lily","Point Robin.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13347","Robin","He now works at a water slide park outside of Ottawa.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13348","Marshall","Point Simon.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13349","Ted","Wait. Do they have a wave pool?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13350","Robin","No.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13351","Marshall","Ah. Point Robin. That's five-zip. There's no coming back from that.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13352","Robin","Yeah, he's going down. I mean, unless somehow, he got hotter. There he is.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13353","Ted from 2030","And sure enough, there was a clear winner, and a clear loser. It just wasn't clear to everybody.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13354","Simon","Hey, babe.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13355","Robin, giggling","Oh, my God.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13356","Ted","Okay, what the hell just happened?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13357","Robin","Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13358","Robin","Hey, Simon.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13359","Simon","Wow, look at you. You got old.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13360","Robin","Yeah. You look great. You got hotter, like that's possible.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13361","Robin","So... Look, I know it didn't go as planned, but I can't help it. I mean... he's still got it.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13362","Simon","Whoa! Four bucks for a brew? What a rip. Good thing I'm packing.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13363","Robin","So he's not a snob. He's from a different part of Canada, you know? The maple leaf flag on the back of the pickup truck? He's Red Province. He's from the Deep North.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13364","Marshall","The thing is, we gave you so many opportunities.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13365","Lily","So, Simon, Robin's a bit of a local celebrity here in New York. She's the lead anchor at Metro News One. Tell him, Robin.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13366","Robin","No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13367","Barney","I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are nattering on about our big celebrity. What do you do for a living?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13368","Simon","Oh, I work at the Splish Splash Ottawa Water Slide Park.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13369","Ted","Huh! A water slide park. That sure is different than what Robin does.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13370","Simon","Yeah, it is... because I save lives. If I'm not sitting in that stool at the top of the slide, going... Go.. Go... Go... people die. What, you think it's so easy? You try it.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13371","Ted","Um... (clears his throat)... okay. Go.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13372","Simon","You didn't put your hand up; kid just died.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13373","Ted","No, I didn't know...","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13374","Simon","Another kid just went; he died too.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13375","Ted","Oh, well, sure. I mean, if I was actually...","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13376","Simon","Another kid just went; now you've got a pile-up and Robin's got something to report on the news. This just in  My friend, Ted, just killed a bunch of kids today.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13377","Lily","Well, that's cool. You got to pay the bills somehow since your whole music thing didn't really pan out, did it?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13378","Simon","Well, it hasn't panned out yet, but the band's still going. About four or five gigs away from really exploding.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13379","Robin","The Foreskins are still playing?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13380","Ted","The Foreskins? How'd you guys come up with that name?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13381","Simon","Well, there's four of us, and we play without shirts. Babe, seriously.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13382","Robin","I know. I'm sorry.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13383","Robin","I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13384","Barney","Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13385","Barney","So, Simon, how did you guys meet?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13386","Simon","Oh, I was in her video.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13387","Robin","Starred in it is more like it.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13388","Simon","Well, once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg, everybody wants a piece of the moneymaker.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13389","Barney","I'm sorry. I've seen ""Let's Go to the Mall"" about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13390","Simon","No, I was in the other one.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13391","Barney","There's another video?!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13392","Barney","Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13393","Robin","No.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13394","Barney","All right! You leave me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute ching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13395","Robin","Okay.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13396","Marshall","It's just... It was so hard to watch, Robin. You're usually so cool.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13397","Robin","I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm sitting next to Simon, and suddenly I'm 16 again.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13398","Ted","Oh, it's actually a common thing. When you're around someone from your past, you kind of revert back to who you were when you knew them. There's not really a name for it, though.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13399","Marshall","It's called ""revertigo.""","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13400","Ted","Yeah, I don't know about ""revertigo.""","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13401","Marshall","You know who gets really bad revertigo? (whispers) Lily when she around her high school friend, Michelle.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13402","Barney","Michelle? She sounds hot.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13403","Ted","You don't know about Lily and Michelle?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13404","Barney","No. What about Lily and Michelle?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13405","Marshall","Oh, my friend, you are in for a treat. Hey, Lil?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13406","Lily","What?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13407","Marshall","You know, I was just thinking, we haven't seen your friend Michelle in a while.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13408","Lily","Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13409","Barney","What... (stammers) Do they make out?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13410","Marshall","Better.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13411","Ted","Comparable.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13412","Marshall","Comparable.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13413","Robin","Whatever. It's over. I lost. I guess you, uh, you don't get second chance.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13414","Robin","I got a second chance.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13415","Lily","What happened?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13416","Robin","He came by my place tonight...","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13417","Robin","Simon. What are you doing here?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13418","Simon","I just feel like there's some unfinished business between you and me. Seeing you now... has made me realize that breaking up with you is the biggest mistake I made in my entire life.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13419","Robin","Oh, I like where this is going.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13420","Simon","I know this is crazy, and I'm only in town for a couple of days, but do you want to go on a date?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13421","Lily","He asked you out?! Oh, step into my web, Simon.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13422","Ted","The coup de grace.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13423","Barney","Finish him!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13424","Robin","I'd love to!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13425","Ted","Wait. You're going on a date with Simon? That Simon?The one we met?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13426","Lily","Robin, this guy doesn't deserve a second chance. Not after the way he treated you.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13427","Robin","That was ten years ago. People evolve. I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13428","Lily","Oh, hell, no!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13429","Marshall","I think you're gonna enjoy this.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13430","Lily","That my girl Michelle?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13431","Michelle","Bitch, you know it!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13432","Lily","How she livin'?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13433","Michelle","She living only way she know how to. Large!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13434","Lily","Oh, girl, you gots to get your drink on up in here.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13435","Michelle","I'm hoping my big ass can hustle me up a vodka-Gatorade.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13436","Lily","For reals.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13437","Barney","I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13438","Robin","Yeah!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13439","Simon","Guys, that was great. Let's take five. Hey, babe, did you like it after my bass solo when I flicked my pick at you?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13440","Robin","That rocked.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13441","Simon","Yeah. Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need that pick back.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13442","Robin","Oh, uh, sure.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13443","Simon","Um, I think it... It's cool. You'll find it later.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13444","Robin","Oh, cool. I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13445","Simon","Oh, but, babe, you got to go to work. You got to play our demo on your show.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13446","Robin","Oh, well, you know, it's not a show. It's the news.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13447","Simon","Right. So you can be, like ""Hey, did you hear there's some news? There's a rad band you guys should check out."" And then play it. Or just, like, the first three songs.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13448","Robin","And now it's time for ""Puppy Corner,"" some little angels looking for a new home, courtesy of the Midtown Animal Shelter.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13449","Robin","Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted. Of course, a lot of the people calling in thought we were going to kill them.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13450","Marshall","Robin, your revertigo is really starting to affect your work.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13451","Lily","What's revertigo?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13452","Ted","It's a stupid, made-up word with no meaning.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13453","Marshall","No. It's a phenomenon where, when you're around people from your past, you start behaving like them.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13454","Lily","Oh. One example of that springs to mind. I think we all know what it is.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13455","Marshall","You do?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13456","Lily","Yeah. Ted.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13457","Ted","Me?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13458","Lily","Whenever Ted's friend Punchy comes into town, it's like, all of a sudden, Ted's in high school again.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13459","Ted","Okay, okay. First of all, his name is Adam Punciarello, and I don't do that.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13460","Ted","Ooh. That must be Adam. 'Sup, Punchy?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13461","Punchy","'Sup, Shmosby?!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13462","Ted","You want to go?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13463","Punchy","I'm already there!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13464","Ted","Dude, seriously, I'm sorry about your dad.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13465","Punchy","Yeah, it was a real shock.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13466","Ted","I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13467","Lily","Why?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13468","Ted","No reason.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13469","Marshall","Robin, the point is, what are you doing? I mean, this guy?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13470","Robin","Okay, you want the truth? Yeah. I like Simon. I do. We have fun together.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13471","Lily","Oh, we know you do, honey, but we're worried about you.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13472","Robin","You're worried? Okay, hold on. Is there any version of this conversation where you guys don't sound like my parents?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13473","Lily","I don't know. Is there any version where you don't sound like a 16-year-old?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13474","Robin","That's exactly what my mom would say.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13475","Lily","No. If I was your mom, I woulsay, ""We forbid you from seeing this boy.""","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13476","Robin","Lily!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13477","Lily","No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13478","Robin","This is my life! You guys just don't get it! You've never felt the way that I feel!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13479","Marshall","Now, now. We were once young and in love, too.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13480","Robin","Yeah, like, a billion years ago.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13481","Lily","You've been drinking, haven't you?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13482","Robin","Yeah, we all have. You bought the last round.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13483","Lily","You're not going to that show tonight!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13484","Robin","Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else? Tonight, after the show, Simon and I are going all the way.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13485","Lily","Young lady, get back here! Thanks for your help.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13486","Ted","Hey, so, today at work...","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13487","Marshall","Not now, Ted!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13488","Ted","Geez.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13489","Robin","Oh, hey, Simon. Great show. You guys still rock.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13490","Simon","Yeah. They totally dug my bass solo. Man! Why can't I always feel this alive?!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13491","Robin","God, I just love seeing you so happy.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13492","Simon","Yeah. About that. Listen, babe. It's over.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13493","Robin","What?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13494","Simon","I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13495","Robin, laughing","What? You're kidding me. You're breaking up with me? Again? F-For the same ex-girlfriend? In the same van? What is it? Her-Her parents got a pool? Is that still the reason?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13496","Ted","Well... I'm sorry, Robin.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13497","Robin","I'm fine, really.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13498","Lily","Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real. Simon's a dawg. You feel me, Chelle?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13499","Michelle","Mm-hmm, for reals. He a scrub.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13500","Lily","Mm. True dat. I'ma get me my champagne and grape soda on.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13501","Ted","So, how's Columbia?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13502","Michelle","Great! I'm almost done with my dissertation. Hmm. I'm getting a PhD in behavioral psychology.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13503","Robin","Um, can I make an observation?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13504","Michelle","Oh. I know. Whenever I'm around Lily, she just brings out that side of me. There's a psychological term for the phenomenon.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13505","Marshall","Revertigo?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13506","Michelle","No. Actually, it's associative regression. You see, the neural pathways that... Oh, no, you did not just put on my jam! Oh. Put your hands up, girl!","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13507","Ted from 2030","One by one, we all had to go home. Soon, it was just Robin.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13508","Barney","All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13509","Robin","Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13510","Barney","Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13511","Robin","No, tonight.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13512","Barney","Ooh. Really? (Robin starts crying)Oh! Oh, come here.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13513","Robin","It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13514","Barney","Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13515","Robin","Right. Of course, the-the first being you.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13516","Barney","No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13517","Robin","Barney, do you want to come back to my place?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13518","Barney","Your place?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13519","Barney","Are you sure you want to do this?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13520","Robin","Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13521","Barney","Of course. So, should I just put it in?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13522","Robin","Yeah, why not?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13523","Robin","This was my big artistic follow-up to""Let's Go to the Mall."" It kind of tanked.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13524","Barney","Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13525","Robin","Oh, I'm so glad.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13526","Barney","Is that Alan Thicke?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13527","Robin","Yeah.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13528","Barney","You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then?","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13529","Robin","Yeah, you're right. I was lame.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13530","Barney","Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13531","Robin","He was my sidekick. He had to be.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13532","Ted from 2030","And so they watched it again... And again... And again. They watched it over and over that night until finally... (Robin and Barney kiss) they stopped watching.","03","16","Sandcastles in the Sand"
"13533","Ted from 2030","Well, kids, here we are. We've arrived, my 30th birthday. The long-awaited story of...the goat. That week started just like any other. Barney woke up in some girl's bed.","03","17","The Goat"
"13534","Barney","In my experience, the way this normally goes is, we lie here for a while, make a little awkward chitchat.","03","17","The Goat"
"13535","Robin","Check.","03","17","The Goat"
"13536","Barney","Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery, rocket test flight I've got to be at, slip out of the apartment and never call you again.","03","17","The Goat"
"13537","Robin","And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, ""who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?""","03","17","The Goat"
"13538","Barney","Actually, you usually say that out loud. So...I just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend","03","17","The Goat"
"13539","Robin","And I just slept with my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.","03","17","The Goat"
"13540","Barney","Best friend.","03","17","The Goat"
"13541","Robin","Okay, here's the deal, Barney. The second my feet touch the ground, this never happened.","03","17","The Goat"
"13542","Barney","Okay. Wait. Right click, save as... Into the.bpeg folder, and okay. This never happened. It's a good plan.","03","17","The Goat"
"13543","Robin","Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.","03","17","The Goat"
"13544","Barney","Okay. Right. So, Robin?","03","17","The Goat"
"13545","Robin","Yes, Barney?","03","17","The Goat"
"13546","Barney","Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?","03","17","The Goat"
"13547","Robin","I'm gonna shower... till June, and, um, since you were never here to begin with, you won't be here when I get out.","03","17","The Goat"
"13548","Barney","Okay. This never happened. Never happened. Never... happened.","03","17","The Goat"
"13549","Ted from 2030","But pretending it never happened wouldn't be that easy.","03","17","The Goat"
"13550","Ted","So, tell us, what was it like?","03","17","The Goat"
"13551","Barney","What?","03","17","The Goat"
"13552","Ted","Penetrating that barrier. You and I are the first ones to hit it. Well, not the first ones, certainly, but the first ones at this table.","03","17","The Goat"
"13553","Barney","I... I... I'm... I'm...","03","17","The Goat"
"13554","Marshall","Although, I'm gonna be hitting it pretty soon.","03","17","The Goat"
"13555","Robin","Yeah, you are.","03","17","The Goat"
"13556","Marshall","Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts.","03","17","The Goat"
"13557","Lily","It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there. I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there.","03","17","The Goat"
"13558","Barney","What are you talking about?!","03","17","The Goat"
"13559","Ted","The big three-oh. You know, my 30th birthday's this friday. Did you forget? What kind of friend is this guy?","03","17","The Goat"
"13560","Barney","Ha-ha right. A great friend, by the way. The best. Is it my imagination, or are these drinks getting smaller? If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, ""try again."" How you doing there, Robin?","03","17","The Goat"
"13561","Robin","I'm good.","03","17","The Goat"
"13562","Ted","Oh, so, I made a a decision. I'm going to go through all my old stuff, And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore. Hmm. Barney, you want my xbox?","03","17","The Goat"
"13563","Barney","Ted, she has a name! And just what are you accusing me of?","03","17","The Goat"
"13564","Ted","Liking video games?","03","17","The Goat"
"13565","Robin","I'm gonna get a drink.","03","17","The Goat"
"13566","Barney","I'll come with you.","03","17","The Goat"
"13567","Robin","Okay.","03","17","The Goat"
"13568","Barney","God, this is awkward.","03","17","The Goat"
"13569","Robin","What is?","03","17","The Goat"
"13570","Barney","Being around Ted.","03","17","The Goat"
"13571","Robin","Why?","03","17","The Goat"
"13572","Barney","Because of our thing.","03","17","The Goat"
"13573","Robin","What thing?","03","17","The Goat"
"13574","Barney","You're really gonna pretend this never happened?","03","17","The Goat"
"13575","Ted","What never happened? What are you guys talking about?","03","17","The Goat"
"13576","Robin","Nothing.","03","17","The Goat"
"13577","Ted","Guys, cut the act. I know. I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me. Marshall let it slip earlier today. Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything. Just be sure to invite Stella.","03","17","The Goat"
"13578","Barney","Stella! You have a serious girlfriend now! You're over this one. Robin who, right? Stella makes this one look like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right? Happy birthday, bro.","03","17","The Goat"
"13579","Marshall","Hello.","03","17","The Goat"
"13580","Barney","Hey, Marshall, I need your help.","03","17","The Goat"
"13581","Marshall","Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now.","03","17","The Goat"
"13582","Barney","I know. I want to hire you.","03","17","The Goat"
"13583","Marshall","For the last time, Barney, I will not be your butler.","03","17","The Goat"
"13584","Barney","I need a lawyer. I'll pay you.","03","17","The Goat"
"13585","Marshall","How much?","03","17","The Goat"
"13586","Barney","A little.","03","17","The Goat"
"13587","Marshall","I'll take it.","03","17","The Goat"
"13588","Marshall","Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say, this might be a little bit over my head. For one thing, I'm fairly certain that if these contracts aren't executed precisely, we will be at war with Portugal.","03","17","The Goat"
"13589","Barney","Forget that. That's a Tuesday for me. New shredder. This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds. From sky mall. It's all from sky mall. Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall. Want a hot dog?","03","17","The Goat"
"13590","Marshall","Of course. Why are you upset?","03","17","The Goat"
"13591","Barney","Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret that you can't tell anyone-- not Ted, not Robin, not Lily.","03","17","The Goat"
"13592","Marshall","No. no, no, no, I don't want any more secrets, especially now that I know what you guys did to the drinking water in lisbon. I...","03","17","The Goat"
"13593","Barney","You are hearing this secret, Marshall. I... I slept... (Marshall covers his ears with his hands and starts singing) Stop..stop doing that. (Barney throws a bowling ball at him, Marshall catches it) I slept... I slept with Robin.","03","17","The Goat"
"13594","Marshall","You slept with Robin?","03","17","The Goat"
"13595","Barney","Are you mad at me?","03","17","The Goat"
"13596","Marshall","I don't know.","03","17","The Goat"
"13597","Barney","How's the hot dog?","03","17","The Goat"
"13598","Marshall","It's helping. You slept with Robin?! I... I cannot keep that secret. I mean, you know I at least have to tell Lily.","03","17","The Goat"
"13599","Barney","You can't. you can't tell anyone. Attorney-client privilege.","03","17","The Goat"
"13600","Marshall","Why are you doing this to me?!","03","17","The Goat"
"13601","Barney","Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer, to prove that I didn't do anying wrong.","03","17","The Goat"
"13602","Marshall","How can I help you as your lawyer? You didn't break any laws, did you? Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?","03","17","The Goat"
"13603","Barney","I didn't break any state or federal laws, but I think I broke a much, much higher law. The Bro Code.","03","17","The Goat"
"13604","Ted from 2030","For many years, we had heard Barney quote the Bro Code, a list of do's and don'ts for all bros. Some were basic.","03","17","The Goat"
"13605","Barney","Bro Code article one ""Bros before hoes.""","03","17","The Goat"
"13606","Ted from 2030","Some were unbelievably complicated.","03","17","The Goat"
"13607","Barney","Bro Code article 89  ""The mom of a bro is always off limits, but the stepmom of a bro is fair game if she initiates it, and/or is wearing at least one a article of leopard print clothing.""","03","17","The Goat"
"13608","Ted from 2030","And some were just plain disturbing.","03","17","The Goat"
"13609","Barney","Bro Code article 34  ""Bros cannot make eye contact during a devil's three-way."" Two dudes.","03","17","The Goat"
"13610","Marshall","This is not a legal docume.. This is just something you wrote.","03","17","The Goat"
"13611","Barney","You think I wrote that? Oh, Marshall, don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?","03","17","The Goat"
"13612","Barney","The year was 1776. The place  Philadelphia. Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were hangng a drink.","03","17","The Goat"
"13613","Benjamin","But, bro, seriously, I called the dibs on that wench. You codpiece blocked me.","03","17","The Goat"
"13614","George","So what if I did? There's no rule against it.","03","17","The Goat"
"13615","Benjamin","Well, there should be. There should be a set of rules that govern the way bros comport themselves among other bros.","03","17","The Goat"
"13616","George","But who shall write such a document? I have to go to Me, D.C.,and pose for the dollar bill.","03","17","The Goat"
"13617","Benjamin","And I have to do some kite-flying or setething.","03","17","The Goat"
"13618","Barney","I shall write this set of rules. And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution. To save paper.","03","17","The Goat"
"13619","George","It's resolved! Barney Stinson shall write... the Bro Code.","03","17","The Goat"
"13620","Barney","And I shall l include a provision that stateth ""No eye contact in a devil's three-way.""","03","17","The Goat"
"13621","Benjamin","Seconded.","03","17","The Goat"
"13622","George","Seconded.","03","17","The Goat"
"13623","Marshall","Listen, what do you want me for?","03","17","The Goat"
"13624","Barney","I've just been losing my mind lately, and do you know why I feel so bad?","03","17","The Goat"
"13625","Marshall","Yeah, because you slept with Robin.","03","17","The Goat"
"13626","Barney","No, that was awesome. I feel bad because the Bro Code clearly states ""No s*x with your bro's ex."" But if you, my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere, then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.","03","17","The Goat"
"13627","Marshall","And you would pay me for that?","03","17","The Goat"
"13628","Barney","No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork. Technically, you'll be paid by a toy factory in Pyongyang.","03","17","The Goat"
"13629","Marshall","Barney, I'm no shrink, okay, but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?","03","17","The Goat"
"13630","Barney","Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation, I'd hire the guy we pay to hint notize us before depositions. Now, get cracking!","03","17","The Goat"
"13631","Ted from 2030","While Marshall examined the Bro Code, Lily's kindergarten class welcomed a special guest.","03","17","The Goat"
"13632","Lily","And with a little luck, in a few days, Farmer Frank's cold will be all gone. And that's why Farmer Frank's breath smells like medicine. Right, Farmer Frank?","03","17","The Goat"
"13633","Frank","You got it, toots.","03","17","The Goat"
"13634","Lily","Any last questions for Farmer Frank? Yes.","03","17","The Goat"
"13635","Girl","Will we ever go to see Missy the Goat again?","03","17","The Goat"
"13636","Frank","Oh! Ah, isn't that sweet! Well, you know, honey, right after this, I'm gonna drop old Missy off at the butcher shop. And they're going to take a great big knife...","03","17","The Goat"
"13637","Ted from 2030","And Frank went on to traumatize Lily's entire class with a graphic explanation of where meat comes from... So not one little scrap of Missy goes to waste.","03","17","The Goat"
"13638","Girl","Ms. Aldrin, please don't let emem eat Missy.","03","17","The Goat"
"13639","Lily","I know, I know. I already called an animal rescue, and they're going to come get her on Monday.","03","17","The Goat"
"13640","Ted","Monday?! Where's she going to sleep and eat and go to the bathroom?! Okay, where's she going to sleep and eat?","03","17","The Goat"
"13641","Lily","I-I guess I'll keep her up on the roof.","03","17","The Goat"
"13642","Ted","Look, call me crazy. I just... I don't think having a goat in the apartment is a good idea.","03","17","The Goat"
"13643","Ted from 2030","And, boy, was I right,because what Missy the Goat would go on to do in that bathroom was so... No, you know what? I'm m getting ahead of myself. We'll get there.","03","17","The Goat"
"13644","Robin","Hey, Ted. You ready to, um... Where'd the goat turd come from?","03","17","The Goat"
"13645","Ted","How'd you know that was a goat turd?","03","17","The Goat"
"13646","Robin","Well, it was either that, or a musk ox turd, and I figured,what the hell would a musk ox be doing in here?","03","17","The Goat"
"13647","Ted","Hey. Guess what your wife brought home.","03","17","The Goat"
"13648","Marshall","Attorney-client privilege.I can't talk about it.","03","17","The Goat"
"13649","Ted","Talk about what?","03","17","The Goat"
"13650","Marshall","Nothing. How was your day? Oh, goat turd on the floor,I see. Is that new?","03","17","The Goat"
"13651","Ted","How does everyone know that's a goat turd?","03","17","The Goat"
"13652","Robin","Barney told you.","03","17","The Goat"
"13653","Marshall","I don't know what you're talking about,madam.","03","17","The Goat"
"13654","Robin","Marshall, you can't look me in the eye, you're blushing, coughing, and your hands are shaking.","03","17","The Goat"
"13655","Ted","Robin, come here!","03","17","The Goat"
"13656","Robin","Ted is never finding out about this, you understand? Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything. And don't even think about opening that can until I'm out of the splash zone.","03","17","The Goat"
"13657","Barney","Fantastic, you're here. Give me the good news.","03","17","The Goat"
"13658","Marshall","I'm sorry. You did too good of a job writing this thing. It's-it's iron-clad.","03","17","The Goat"
"13659","Barney","No! Bad lawyer! I need a loophole! I want to feel better, Marshall! I can't keep buying things! I have six self-cleaning litterboxes and I don't even have a kid. Wait. How about this? Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right? And if he's broken the Bro Code, then I'm off the hook.","03","17","The Goat"
"13660","Marshall","I thought about that. And I gotta say, Ted has upheld this thing time and time again. For example, article 87  ""A bro shall at all times say yes.""","03","17","The Goat"
"13661","Woman","So he saved you from an avalanche?","03","17","The Goat"
"13662","Ted","Yes.","03","17","The Goat"
"13663","Woman","And he carried you six miles to safety on his broken leg?","03","17","The Goat"
"13664","Ted","Yes.","03","17","The Goat"
"13665","Woman","And you're a pre-op transsexual nightclub singer who used to be a member of the Russian mob?","03","17","The Goat"
"13666","Ted","Da.","03","17","The Goat"
"13667","Marshall","Article 29 ""A bro will in a timely manner alert his bro to the existence of a girl fight.""","03","17","The Goat"
"13668","Ted","Dude, two girls are fighting at MacLaren's.","03","17","The Goat"
"13669","Barney","What?!","03","17","The Goat"
"13670","Ted","Yeah, yeah. It was crazy. This one girl was like... Oh, hey.","03","17","The Goat"
"13671","Barney","Hey.","03","17","The Goat"
"13672","Marshall","Article 53  ""A bro will, whenever possible, provide his bro with protection.""","03","17","The Goat"
"13673","Woman","That feels nice.","03","17","The Goat"
"13674","Barney","Good.","03","17","The Goat"
"13675","Woman","I just wish we had some wine.","03","17","The Goat"
"13676","Barney","Yeah. I wish we had some wine, too.","03","17","The Goat"
"13677","Barney","Damn it, Marshall. I'm not paying you to tell me what a saint Ted is! You're my lawyer! The answer is in there! Find it!","03","17","The Goat"
"13678","Marshall","Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it. The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong. And the only way you're ever gonna feel any better about it is if you tell Ted what you did.","03","17","The Goat"
"13679","Barney","What if he never wants to talk to me again?","03","17","The Goat"
"13680","Marshall","Well, I guess that's just a chance you're gonna have to take.","03","17","The Goat"
"13681","Ted from 2030","Which brings us to April 25, 2008. My 30th birthday, or as it would come to be referred to in later years  The Day of the Goat.","03","17","The Goat"
"13682","Lily","Hey, where are you?","03","17","The Goat"
"13683","Barney","I'm in the limo, right outside of Ted's office.","03","17","The Goat"
"13684","Lily","Great. Well, everyone's here. Stella just arrived and there is something here so awesome, I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you won't believe...","03","17","The Goat"
"13685","Barney","Goat in a party hat?","03","17","The Goat"
"13686","Lily","Damn it! Well, you still gotta see it. It's so much fun having a goat at a party!","03","17","The Goat"
"13687","Ted from 2030","In a few short hours, Lily would come to regret those words. But we'll get there.","03","17","The Goat"
"13688","Barney","Uh, gotta go. Here he comes.","03","17","The Goat"
"13689","Lily","Okay. Bye.","03","17","The Goat"
"13690","Ted","Whoa, you guys went all out.","03","17","The Goat"
"13691","Lily","Okay, everyone, Ted's in the limo, five-minute warning! Everyone get ready! Oh, Missy, are you excit?? Yes, you are!","03","17","The Goat"
"13692","Ted","Whoa, we're leaving the city. Where the hell is this party?","03","17","The Goat"
"13693","Barney","Vegas.","03","17","The Goat"
"13694","Ted","Vegas? I thought the party was on the rooftop.","03","17","The Goat"
"13695","Barney","Surprise! Just a decoy, my friend.","03","17","The Goat"
"13696","Ted","So there's no roof party?","03","17","The Goat"
"13697","Barney","Oh, no. There is. We're just not going. This is how good a friend I am. They want you to spent your 30th standing around drinking flat beer ten feet above your living room. But not me, bro. I pulled out all the stops. Private jet, Valderrama suite at the Bellagio. Steaks at BOA, scotch at Ghostbar, then two ringside seats to watch Floyd Mayatather go ten rounds with, wait for it... a grizzly bear!","03","17","The Goat"
"13698","Ted","Take me home, Barney.","03","17","The Goat"
"13699","Barney","No! We have to go to Vegas. Look, Ted, I didn't want to say this, but... there's something that I have to tell you, and I wanted you to be in the best possible frame of mind before you heard it.","03","17","The Goat"
"13700","Ted","You slept with Robin.","03","17","The Goat"
"13701","Ranjit","You slept with Robin? Barney! That is Ted's ex-girlfriend!","03","17","The Goat"
"13702","Barney","When did you find out?","03","17","The Goat"
"13703","Ted","Hey, Robin. Come here!","03","17","The Goat"
"13704","Robin","What's up?","03","17","The Goat"
"13705","Ted","I was, uh, just going through some old stuff and I...","03","17","The Goat"
"13706","Marshall","Oh, crap!","03","17","The Goat"
"13707","Ted","Anyway, uh, I came across this.","03","17","The Goat"
"13708","Robin","From my vacacation in Vermont.","03","17","The Goat"
"13709","Ted","Yeah. I don't know if you'd even want it, but if you do, it's yours.","03","17","The Goat"
"13710","Robin","I slept with Barney!","03","17","The Goat"
"13711","Ted","What?","03","17","The Goat"
"13712","Robin","It was just one time, it, it was the night that Simon dumped me and I was in a really vulnerable place and I, I wanted to just pretend like it never happened, but I couldn't, and... I can't. I just, I had to tell you. And... I just hope that we can still be friends.","03","17","The Goat"
"13713","Ted","Of course we can still be friends.","03","17","The Goat"
"13714","Robin","So you're not mad?","03","17","The Goat"
"13715","Ted","Well, I'm... it's a little weird, but, um... No, I'm not mad.","03","17","The Goat"
"13716","Barney","So you're not mad?","03","17","The Goat"
"13717","Ted","No, I'm not mad. I mean, Robin and I broke up a year ago. We've, we've both dated lots of people since then. I'm with Stella now. Seriously, I...I'm fine with this.","03","17","The Goat"
"13718","Barney","I'm so relieved to hear you say that.","03","17","The Goat"
"13719","Ted","Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hey, I just remembered, um, my mom is coming into town next month. Maybe you'd like to nail her, too!","03","17","The Goat"
"13720","Marshall","Where are they?! I'm getting a cramp.","03","17","The Goat"
"13721","Lily","Marshall, can we keep the goat?","03","17","The Goat"
"13722","Marshall","No.","03","17","The Goat"
"13723","Lily","But she's so cute and furry and soft.","03","17","The Goat"
"13724","Marshall","Yeah, and she also sheds, eats out of the garbage and can't control her bobowels.","03","17","The Goat"
"13725","Lily","Why don't we just call Duluth Mental Hospital and say my Uncle Linus can live with us?","03","17","The Goat"
"13726","Robin","Yeah, Lily, that may seem like a good idea after a couple of drinks but tomorrow morning you're going to want this thing out of your house.","03","17","The Goat"
"13727","Lily","Oh, you should talk.You slept with Barney.","03","17","The Goat"
"13728","Robin","Marshall!","03","17","The Goat"
"13729","Marshall","I'm sorry! I couldn't take it anymore.","03","17","The Goat"
"13730","Lily","I can't believe you did that. That's so gross. Was it amazing?","03","17","The Goat"
"13731","Robin","What? I... Lily, I really don't want to talk about this.","03","17","The Goat"
"13732","Lily","I know but it's Barney. It's just hard not to be curious. Did he have like devices and stuff?","03","17","The Goat"
"13733","Robin","Lily,come on.","03","17","The Goat"
"13734","Lily","Hot wax?","03","17","The Goat"
"13735","Marshall","Stop it.","03","17","The Goat"
"13736","Lily","Did he tie you to anything?","03","17","The Goat"
"13737","Marshall","That's enough. What's wrong with you?","03","17","The Goat"
"13738","Lily","I'm sorry. Is he all smooth down there?","03","17","The Goat"
"13739","Ted","Three billion women on the planet! Three billion! And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?! Robin?!","03","17","The Goat"
"13740","Barney","You think I'm proud of this?! I'm horrified that this happened.","03","17","The Goat"
"13741","Ted","How did it happen? Huh? Barney, I want to know. Tell me exactly how it happened.","03","17","The Goat"
"13742","Barney","You mean... what position? (They starts fighting) Stop it! Stop it!","03","17","The Goat"

"13748","Barney","Okay. Okay. You're pissed. You deserve to be. Fine. You know what? One free shot. On me. Anywhere but the face. (Ted hits him where it hurts the most...) Who punches someone in the groin? Okay.Okay. I deserved that. I deserved that. But what's important now is... we're passed this whole Robin thing now, right?","03","17","The Goat"
"13749","Ted","You think that this is just about Robin? This is about... You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff. I mean some really terrible stuff to a lot of different people. I just always thought there had to be a limit. I always thought I was the limit. You're always spouting off these rules for bros. Isn't one of them, ""don't do this""?","03","17","The Goat"
"13750","Barney","Yeah. And I broke it. I'm sorry. But, Ted...seriously, this suite at the Bellagio...","03","17","The Goat"
"13751","Ted","I am not going to Vegas with you! I'm not going to blow off my friends and my girlfriend, and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club. The fact that you think I would... You know, Barney,earlier this week I started putting things in a box and that box was labeled ""stuff I have no use for anymore.""","03","17","The Goat"
"13752","Barney","What does that mean?","03","17","The Goat"
"13753","Ted","It means... maybe you belong in that box.","03","17","The Goat"
"13754","Barney","Are you saying you don't want to be bros anymore?","03","17","The Goat"
"13755","Ted","I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.","03","17","The Goat"
"13756","Barney","Okay, I'm going to stop you right there, because it seems like you're about to say something that's going to pretty much ruin Vegas.","03","17","The Goat"
"13757","Ted","Ranjit, stop the car. I'm getting a cab.","03","17","The Goat"
"13758","Everyone","Surprise!","03","17","The Goat"
"13759","Ted from 2030","Oh, right, the goat. So funny.You're going to love this. So later in that night, the goat locked himself in the bathroom and was eating one of Robin's washcloths and wait, hold on. Robin wasn't living here on my 30th birthday. When did this happen? Oh, wait, the goat was there on my 31st birthday. Sorry, I totally got that wrong.","03","17","The Goat"
"13760","Narrator","Now kids, the spring of 2008 was a complicated time in your old man's life. (Cut to when Ted and Barney was in the limo) The last time I had seen Barney was shortly after I found out he has spent the night with Robin.","03","18","Rebound Bro"

"13783","Marshall","Wait, so you haven't had s*x since like Thanksgiving. Do you know how many big federal holidays have come and gone since then.","03","18","Rebound Bro"

"13820","Stella","Me too!","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13821","Ted","It's been five months for you too?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13822","All (except Ted)","Five years!!??","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13823","Marshall","Wow. Stella hasn't had s*x since 2003. Let's just put this in context. The last time Stella had s*x, the movie, Seabiscuit, had just galloped into the theaters... and our hearts.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13824","Lily","Five years! God, if I even went one year, I would be out on the street selling it for a nickel.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13825","Marshall","The last time Stella had s*x, the world was just learning about SARS.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13826","Robin","Well, Ted, what else did she said? Did she gave you any kind of explanation?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13827","Stella","Look, after Lucy was born, I dated a little, but it was hard to find a guy I could trust enough. Sooner or later, every one of them gave me a reason not to.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13828","Ted","But nobody in five years?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13829","Stella","Look, Ted, guys regret the girls they didn't sleep with. Girls regret the guys they do sleep with. And for the past five years, I've had no regrets. Ted, you're staring at my boobs.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13830","Ted","In my defense, they were staring at me.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13831","Lily","So what does this mean for you? Is she ever wanna want to get intimate?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13832","Ted","Actually...","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13833","Stella","But the truth is, I really do want to do this with you. I don't think I'd regret it at all.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13834","Ted","Your pillow talk's a little rusty.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13835","Stella","You know what I mean Ted, I'm ready.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13836","Ted","That's great. Like ""right now"" ready? (She laughs)","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13837","Ted","So, her sister's driving up to baby-sit Lucy, and we're getting a hotel room in the city Saturday night.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13838","Marshall","The last time Stella had s*x, The Da Vinci Code had just come out.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13839","Robin","Well that's doesn't seem like that long ago.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13840","Marshall","Not the movie, the book.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13841","Robin","Wow.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13842","Ted","It's a lot of pressure, isn't it?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13843","Lily","You know what? It's not. This woman needs it bad. Anything you do is going to be fireworks. I remember my longest drought...","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13844","Lily","(V.O.) It was that summer I lived in San Francisco. I hadn't had been with Marshall since two months and 19 days. (There is a shock. And Lily likes the sensation which that gets her.)","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13845","Lily","Oh, San Francisco!","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13846","Ted","I don't know Lily, after five years, her expectations have gotta be pretty high.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13847","Marshall (watching on Internet)","Notable deaths in 2003... Oh my God... Nell Carter. Did you guys know that Nell Carter had died?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13848","Ted","I really gonna have to bring my A-game to satisfy this woman.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13849","Robin","Yeah, it'll be pretty hard now that she's dead.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13850","Ted","Not Nell Carter... Stella.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13851","Marshall","Dude, relax, it's all about expectations management. Do you know why I hated Jerry Maguire so much?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13852","Ted","Because you're dead inside?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13853","Marshall","No, because you built it up for, like, two weeks, saying it was the greatest movie ever. With Stella, do the opposite  lower expectations.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13854","Ted","Right, right, and then no matter what happens, she'll be happy.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13855","Marshall (in the phone)","Hey, buddy. I'm married, Barney, I cannot be your new wingman. (Marshall hangs up, then Robin's phone rings, she picks up the phone and say directly...)","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13856","Robin","No. (And hangs up)","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13857","Barney","Hey, Randy. Could you come here for a minute? (Randy releases a box. And comes in Barney's office by running) Good news. I'm calling you up to the majors. Starting tomorrow night, how would you like to be my new wingman?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13858","Randy","Uh... Just need to check my calendar. Be right back. (Then he goes in the lane, and dances. He comes back.) Tomorrow works.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13859","Ted","I have a surprise appetizer for us today. Check it out. Potato skins.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13860","Stella","Fancy?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13861","Ted","Yeah. Right? God, it's been forever since I had potato skins. I remember them as being pretty much the most delicious things ever. (He eats the potato skin) Huh. That's surprising.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13862","Stella","What?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13863","Ted","This potato skin. It's good but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head. Even though potato skin performed admirably, and is a totally respectable size... I couldn't enjoy it because of my own unrealistic expectations.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13864","Stella","Hmm, Ted, I see what you're doing. You're trying to lower my expectations for tonight. Is this a lengh thing?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13865","Ted","No.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13866","Stella","Quick on the draw?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13867","Ted","No.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13868","Stella","Unexpected number of testicules?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13869","Ted","No. It's just that this is a big deal for you. I mean, it's like your virginity  the sequel. (She laughs)","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13870","Stella","Virginity 2  Eletric Boogaloo?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13871","Ted","Exactly, and I don't want to mess it up. I don't want you to ever wonder if was worth it.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13872","Stella","Oh Ted, of course it's gonna be worth it. Stop worrying. It's you and me. It already has everything it needs. (They kiss each other)","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13873","Ted","""Unexpected number of testicules?""","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13874","Stella","It happens. I knew a guy in med school... we used to joke that we was one ball away from getting walked. (They laugh)","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13875","Barney","Hey.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13876","Randy","What up bro-seph Lieberman?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13877","Barney","No, uh-uh. Randy, we never use the word ""bro"" in the name of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13878","Randy","(He takes out his memo pad) Goodbye ""Geraldine Ferrar-bro"".","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13879","Barney","You know what? I'm excited about this, Randy. You will be my next masterpiece. It's like with Ted. When I first met him, he was an even bigger loser than you.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13880","Randy","What a loser.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13881","Barney","But tonight, I'm going to make you the greatest wingman in the history of wingmen.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13882","Randy","Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro. Yeah. I've been reading your blog for years. You are like a God to me. That's why tonight is going to be legendary... wait for it... dary.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13883","Barney","Oh, okay, Randy, let's do this. (Barney wants to pick up two young woman)","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13884","Randy","Ok.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13885","Barney","You ready?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13886","Randy","Yes. (Barney starts walking and Randy holds Barney by the arm) No, no, no, no, no, no!","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13887","Barney","What? What's the matter?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13888","Randy","Nothing, let's do this. (Barney starts walking and Randy holds Barney by the arm) No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please! Just wait, just wait, just wait, just wait!","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13889","Barney","Randy what are you doing?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13890","Randy","Dripping with game, that's what i'm doing. Okay let's go. No. Yes. No! Randy listen to me  you can do this okay? Ok. I don't know. Are thos girls really that hot? Yes, they're hot. Let's do this. Okay!","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13891","Barney","(Finally Randy is ready, so Barney goes talking to the girls) Hey, laddies. Have you met... (He points the finger towards Randy and turns around. But Randy hid under a table.)","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13892","Ted","Hey.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13893","Stella","Hey.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13894","Ted","So, here's the plan. Take a horse-drawn carriage through the park, and it just so happens the Philharmonic is playing an open-air...","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13895","Stella","Ted. Five years.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13896","Ted","Straight to the hotel?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13897","Stella","Straight to the hotel.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13898","Ted","I'll get my bag. (Ted go to his bedroom)","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13899","Stella","Hey, guys.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13900","Lily","Hey.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13901","Marshall","Hey. So, uh, looking forward to tonight?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13902","Stella","Yeah. Definitly. It's been such a long time since I've had a night out.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13903","Lily","Yeah. We heard. I would explode if it had been that long since I had a ""night out"".","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13904","Marshall","This one wakes me up at 4am sometimes just to have a little night out.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13905","Stella","Um, what are you guys talking about?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13906","Lily","Nothing. Pizza. What are you talking about?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13907","Ted","Hey guys.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13908","Stella","Ted, you told them, didn't you?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13909","Ted","Told them what?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13910","Stella","You told them that I haven't had s*x in five years. (She seems embarrassing)","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13911","Marshall","You haven't had s*x in five years??!! That is a shocking revelation that we're just finding out right now!","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13912","Ted","Stella, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told them. But they're my best friends. I tell them everything. I-I didn't even think about it.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13913","Stella","Ted, that was so personal. Plus, now your friends think I'm a freak.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13914","Ted","No, they don't.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13915","Stella","Look, I realize it's weird, okay? Not many people go five years without having s*x.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13916","Barney","13 years??!!","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13917","Randy","I peaked really young.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13918","Stella","That's why it was difficult for me to tell you. But I did tell you because I thought that I could trust you.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13919","Ted","You can trust me.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13920","Stella","Obviously, I can't. You know there's always a reason not to sleep with a guy, and you just gave me yours.","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13921","Ted","Wait, did I gave you a reason or were you looking for one?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13922","Stella","Why would be looking for one?","03","18","Rebound Bro"
"13923","Ted from 2030","Kids, in the spring of 2008 something kind of strange have been happening to your uncle Barney. He's been doing great with a woman.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13924","Barney","So I threw the pressure air oxygen into its mouth. I shoot the tank, boo, nomore shark. Mr. Hall and I swam back to shore. Hey,let me serve you a drink.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13925","Ted from 2030","He's only been gone a few moments but when he return...","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13926","Barney","So where were we?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13927","Ted from 2030","...he gets slap! It kept happening...","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13928","Woman","Jerk!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13929","Ted from 2030","Until finally Lily was approached by a mysterious woman who wants her stay away from Barney...so when it happened once more...","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13930","Barney","Again? Really? Wait...","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13931","Ted from 2030","Barney knew who to look for...","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13932","Barney","Hey, excuse me. Did I sleep with you and then totally screw you over?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13933","Woman","No.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13934","Barney","What are you doing on Friday?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13935","Barney","Stop! Amy?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13936","Abby","Abby.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13937","Barney","Riiiggghhhttt!!!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13938","Ted from 2030","Kids, sometimes you can do something right a thousand times in a row...","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13939","Lily","A rainbow! That's beautiful! What a beautiful rainbow! Another rainbow? It's beautiful!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13940","Ted from 2030","But then, that thousand-and-first time...","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13941","Lily","You're kidding me. Seriously, aren't you sick of these things?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13942","Ted","Hey, how was your day?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13943","Lily","Today, I yelled at a little girl for painting a rainbow.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13944","Ted","A rainbow? Sounds like that bitch had it coming.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13945","Marshall","So, uh, I just met with the contractor. and it turns out, that fixing the floors of the new apartment is going to cost a lot more than the estimate.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13946","Lily","But we can barely afford that to begin with.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13947","Marshall","I hate to say this, but I think you're going to have to sell your stuff.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13948","Lily","Whoa! Marshall, that's just a game we play in the bedroom.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13949","Marshall","I mean your clothes. All those designer pieces and everything.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13950","Lily","What? Why just my clothes?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13951","Marshall","We can sell my stuff, too, but I got to tell you, I think your Marc Jacobs cocktail dress is going to go for a lot more than my ""Split Happens"" bowling shirt.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13952","Ted","Dude.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13953","Marshall","I'm not selling that. I've already made the Website.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13954","Lily","You made a Website?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13955","Marshall","Yeah, it's called ""Lily-and-Marshall-sell- their-stuff-dot-com.""","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13956","Lily","No, you know what would be a better name for the site? Guy-forces-his-wife- to-dress-in-a-garbage-bag- for-the-next- three-years-dot-com. That's real.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13957","Marshall","I'm worried. That woman is actually wearing a-a garbage bag.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13958","Lily","Hmm, but, girlfriend, you cannot pull off a tall kitchen.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13959","Barney","Why are you trying to ruin my life?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13960","Abby","Well, you slept with me and then you never called me again.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13961","Barney","And?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13962","Abby","That's it.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13963","Barney","That's it? As far as I'm concerned, if I leave you safe on dry land with adequate transportation home, you've got nothing to complain about.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13964","Abby","Well, it hurt, okay? And then Ted, the love of my life started dating my boss instead of me. Do you know how that feels?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13965","Barney","Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13966","Abby","Abby!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13967","Barney","Abby. A few weeks ago, Ted dumped me as his wingman. You had a crush on him for a couple weeks? I was Ted's best friend for seven years.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13968","Abby","Ted said Marshall was his best friend.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13969","Barney","Seven years!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13970","Abby","Sorry.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13971","Barney","Ted. What an idiot. With his stupid ""meaningful relationship"" with Stella.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13972","Abby","I hate Ted.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13973","Barney","I hate Ted more.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13974","Abby","Are you as turned on as I am?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13975","Barney","Probably not quite as much.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13976","Abby","I'm sorry I yelled out ""Ted.""","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13977","Barney","I'm sorry I yelled out ""Abby.""","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13978","Abby","I am Abby.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13979","Barney","Oh, cool.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13980","Ted","This is insane. Has Lily even worn half this stuff?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13981","Robin","Oh, yeah, like there's nothing in your closet you've never worn?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13982","Ted","As a matter of fact, no, there isn't.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13983","Robin","Whatever, red cowboy boots.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13984","Ted","Those are nice boots. I totally pull those off.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13985","Marshall","Hey, Lil, if I were to say ""Ted could never pull them off,"" What would I be talking about?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13986","Robin","His red cowboy boots.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13987","Ted","I totally pull them off! It's a classic Western look.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13988","Marshall","Oh, okay, uh, today's category  classic Westerns that involve red cowboy boots. Ooh, ooh! Robin.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13989","Robin","""The Good, the Bad, and the Fabulous.""","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13990","Lily","""The Magnificent Kevin.""","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13991","Marshall","""No Country for Straight Men.""","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13992","Lily","I don't want to sell my clothes!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13993","Robin","Oh, I know, sweetie. Come here. Is this a hundred percent silk?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13994","Marshall","Lily,listen, we really need the money. I have some leads on a job, but until then, I just... I don't know what else we can do.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13995","Lily","I'll sell my paintings!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13996","Marshall","What?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13997","Lily","Yeah, I'll sell my paintings. Good oil paintings go for like, $500.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13998","Marshall","Yeah. Totally. But...","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"13999","Ted from 2030","Kids, sometimes you can do something right a thousand times in a row...","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14000","Marshall","I love it. It's a masterpiece. That's it. We're selling the TV. I just want to come home and stare at this all day. Aw. Somebody call the cops! My wife stole an awesome painting from the museum!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14001","Ted from 2030","But then, that thousand-and-first time...","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14002","Marshall","...that kind of money only goes for real paintings.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14003","Lily","What does that mean?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14004","Marshall","Look, it just, it just means that-that we need money right now and I'm not sure that selling your paintings is-is how we're going to get it.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14005","Lily","You don't believe in me.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14006","Marshall","No, wait, wait! Of c... of course I believe in you!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14007","Lily","Marshall, I am proud of my work as an artist. My paintings are good. I bet Robin would buy one. What now?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14008","Marshall","I love your painting, I just... I'm trying to be realistic.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14009","Lily","Well, how much money do we need for the contractor to finish the job?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14010","Marshall","About 1,500 bucks.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14011","Lily","Okay. So, if I can sell three of my paintings at 500 bucks a pop, then I get to keep all my clothes.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14012","Marshall","Babe, we need money fast.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14013","Lily","Well, give me a week.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14014","Marshall","Okay, a-a week.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14015","Lily","Fine.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14016","Marshall","Fine.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14017","Ted","Pulling... Them... Off.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14018","Ted from 2030","Lily's first move on a great art challenge of 2008 was to display one of her favorite paintings at her friend's gallery. The night didn't go so well. But then at the last minute...","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14019","Woman","I love it.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14020","Lily","You do?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14021","Woman","Yeah, your top. It's gorgeous. Is that 100% silk?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14022","Lily","It's not for sale! My clothes are not for sale!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14023","Ted from 2030","So the next day, Lily took her painting to a coffee house that displayed local artists.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14024","Lily","We've been sitting here for hours and nobody's even glanced at my painting. Come on. Let's start talking it up.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14025","Robin","Wow! I really like that painting! It's neat! The-the colors are neat. The-the shapes are neat. It's really just... neat. What?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14026","Ted","Observe. I think there's a dynamic quality to the brushwork that, combined with the fluid composition, creates an almost Kandinsky-like emotional resonance.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14027","Robin","Yes, and you can still enjoy it even if you're not a pretentious douche.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14028","Ted","Can you clarify something for me about your critique? Are the colors ""neat"" or are they more ""neato burrito?""","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14029","Robin","Uh, then again, red cowboy boots.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14030","Ted","I pull these off! (Everyone is laughing at him) I pull these off!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14031","Abby","You know what I hate most about Ted?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14032","Barney","What?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14033","Abby","His stupid hair. His stupid, lame awesome hair. It's so stupid and awesome.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14034","Barney","You know what I hate most about Ted?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14035","Abby","What?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14036","Barney","How he's always like, ""Oh, I want to fall in love and have a relationship. I care about the people I have s*x with."" He's so lame.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14037","Abby","He's so lame and awesome.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14038","Barney","You know what he needs? He needs to see just how horrible he is when he's in a relationship.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14039","Abby","Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14040","Barney","I think so.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14041","Abby","You're thinking of having s*x with Ted?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14042","Ted from 2030","After four days without selling a single painting, Lily was getting desperate.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14043","Lily","Painting for sale! $500! Lifelong dream hanging in the balance! It's like they don't even see us.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14044","Man","Yeah, we're dirt to them. What do you need money for?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14045","Lily","Oh, I'm trying to fix the hardwood floors in my new apartment. You?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14046","Man","Heroin.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14047","Lily","Do you like heroin?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14048","Man","Love it. In fact, if you sell that, I'm going to take your money and go buy some more heroin.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14049","Lily","Thanks for your honesty, Crazy Sock Guy. Oh, I'm never gonna sell this...","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14050","Man","It's not very good.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14051","Ted from 2030","And just as she was about to lose all hope, something amazing happened.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14052","Man","2 Oh, my God!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14053","Lily","500 bucks! Who's a real painter now, Marshall?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14054","Marshall","Honey, I never said you weren't a real painter.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14055","Lily","Oh, I know, sweetie. And since I'm a professional artist now, I'm going to sketch you an Aldrin original, you know, to say thanks for being such a supportive husband. I'm thinking about calling it... ""Suck It!""","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14056","Marshall","Lily, come on. I'm proud of you. Who-who bought it?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14057","Lily","Well, that's the best part. A gay couple without kids. A G-CWOK!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14058","Ted","You bagged a G-CWOK?!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14059","Lily","Yeah, that's right. They are the heart and soul of the art-buying community.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14060","Ted","You know what you should do? You should call up the G-CWOKs and offer them a free painting if they throw a private art party for all their G-CWOK friends.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14061","Lily","That's an amazing idea. I'm going to go call them. I can probably sell two more paintings with time to spare. Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something I had to tell you. What was it? Oh, that's right. Suck it.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14062","Barney","Ted, fancy bumping into you here. Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14063","Ted","Uh, yeah.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14064","Barney","Hi, Abby.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14065","Ted","Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14066","Barney","That's right. I am done with this whole being awesome thing. Now I'm all about farmers' markets and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14067","Abby","That's right. And girlfriends are lame. Unless they're me. I miss you, Ted.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14068","Barney","Abby and I are in love. Not hot passionate love. Couple love. You know, movie night with my girlfriend, then waiting for her to go to bed so I can steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14069","Abby","We're showing Ted how lame he is.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14070","Barney","You don't have to say it, though.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14071","Ted","Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14072","Barney","Stop what, Ted? Stop being in love? Next he'll ask us to stop breathing.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14073","Abby","We can't stop breathing, Ted. Your hair looks amazing.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14074","Ted","Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing. Please stop.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14075","Barney","Not before I share with you what being in a relationship leads to, Ted. Abby, Pookie Bear... I am so pathetically desperate for you that... aw, heck, I'll just say it. Would you marry me?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14076","Abby","Wait, really?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14077","Barney","I would never joke about true love.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14078","Abby","Yes, I'll marry you.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14079","Barney","Okay.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14080","Abby","Thank you, thank you. I have to call my mom.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14081","Barney","That's you.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14082","Ted","Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14083","Barney","Uh, yes, she does.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14084","Abby","It finally happened, Mama. I just wish Daddy were alive to walk me down the aisle.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14085","Barney","Totally committed to the bit.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14086","Lily","Yes, Lily Aldrin. I sold you the painting earlier today.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14087","Man 2","Oh, honey, hello.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14088","Lily","You sound happy.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14089","Man 2","Are you kidding? We're popping the champagne right now.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14090","Lily","Well, I just wanted to offer you an exclusive chance to view some of my other paintings.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14091","Man 2","Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, oh, I guess I should have told you. We just bought that for the frame.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14092","Lily","What?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14093","Man 2","Yeah, it's an original Anton Kreutzer, a very rare frame from the turn of the century.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14094","Lily","So... y-you didn't like my painting?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14095","Man 2","Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, no, not at all. But you know, good for you.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14096","Lily","Okay. Well, if you didn't want the painting, can I... can I at least get it back?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14097","Man 2","Yeah, no, we don't have it anymore.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14098","Lily","Where is it? I see. H-He threw out my painting.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14099","Man 2","Champagne for everyone on me, the happiest guy in the world.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14100","Lily","This is great. My dream of becoming an artist is dead, and now I'm watching my wardrobe disappear piece by piece. There goes my favorite dress. This dress meant a lot to me.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14101","Robin","Really?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14102","Lily","Yeah. It was spring of 2004 and I had been having a hard few months.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14103","Man","Da-amn.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14104","Lily","I got a two-syllable ""damn"" in this dress.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14105","Robin","A two-syllable ""damn."" That's the dream.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14106","Lily","Yeah. Now she belongs to... CanadaGirl(a)MetroNewsOne.com.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14107","Robin","It's still in the family.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14108","Marshall","Lily, you're not going to believe this. Something amazing happened.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14109","Lily","What?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14110","Marshall","I went to the G-CWOK's apartment.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14111","Lily","Really? Why?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14112","Marshall","Because I felt guilty. This auction was my idea and now you've had to sit around all day while a bunch of vultures ruthlessly pick apart the carcass of your wardrobe.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14113","Robin","It's still in the family.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14114","Marshall","And more importantly, I honestly love that painting and I couldn't stand to think of it in a trashcan someplace.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14115","Lily","Well, what happened?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14116","Man 2","Well, hello.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14117","Marshall","Hi, um... Lawrence. I-I'm here about the painting my wife Lily solyou-- the one in the nice frame.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14118","Lawrence","Talk about a nice frame. My, my, you are a big one, aren't you? And you're married to that little bit of a thing. How does that work? I'd like to find out.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14119","Lily","Yeah, we get it. Gay guys like you.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14120","Marshall","No, Lily, they love me, but that's not the important part.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14121","Ted","Here's the important part.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14122","Ted","Since you're clearly a man of impeccable taste and style, I-I came down here to ask you  what do you think of the boots?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14123","Lawrence","Walter. Boots.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14124","Walter","Pulling... Them.... Off.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14125","Ted","I'll be in the cab.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14126","Ted","G-CWOK-approved.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14127","Lily","The painting!","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14128","Marshall","Right, so, um, they told me they threw it in the building's Dumpster.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14129","Marshall","It wasn't in there, but the super told me that he'd seen one Dr. Greer-- a veterinarian who works in the building-- take the painting out of the trash.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14130","Lily","Dr. Greer? Who's Dr. Greer a-and why did he take my painting?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14131","Marshall","You're about to find out.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14132","Dr Greer","I had to make a trash run. Been a busy day-- lots of neuterings.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14133","Lily","Ooh, we don't need the details.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14134","Dr Greer","Oh, n-n-no, it's not what you think. Oh, thank God. Yeah, yeah, yeah, mostly just dog testicles.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14135","Dr Greer","Anyway... I noticed your painting just sitting right there on top and I thought, ""Hey,free painting,"" so I brought it upstairs and hung it up in Exam Room 3, and then the strangest thing happened. Hey, Muffin. Whoa, I think he remembers me from the last time he was here. Take Muffin to Exam Room 3. I'll meet you there. I went in, expecting the worst. I'd never seen Muffin that calm, and then a little later the same thing happened again with Tidbit... and King Larry... and again with the Weinstein triplets.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14136","Dr Greer","Something about your art speaks to the canine sensibility on a very primal level.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14137","Lily","Really? Dogs like my paintings?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14138","Dr Greer","Yeah. But you know who it bums out? Birds. Yeah. Had a parrot in there today. He took one look at it, pried open his cage, flew right into the ceiling fan.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14139","Marshall","Anyway, because your first painting worked so well, I convinced Dr. Greer to buy four more.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14140","Lily","Really?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14141","Marshall","Mm-hmm, at $500 a piece.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14142","Lily","That's two grand. That's more than we need for the contractor.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14143","Marshall","Yeah, but I was actually thinking we could reinvest it.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14144","Lily","In what?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14145","Marshall","In you.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14146","Ted from 2030","Marshall explained that he was building a fancy new Web site specifically to sell Lily's artwork to veterinarians.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14147","Lily","Well, it's not exactly the clientele I had in mind, but... thank you for believing in me.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14148","Marshall","Man, birds do not get you.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14149","Abby","Hi, sweetie.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14150","Barney","Hey, I think I left my tie here. Have you seen it?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14151","Abby","No, I'm in wedding-planning mode. Stressville. Population  me. Okay, big decision. What do you think the cake should be  Fudgie the Whale or Cookie Puss?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14152","Barney","Yeah, that was a bit. We were doing a bit.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14153","Abby","So I'm thinking Labor Day. I was going to say Fourth of July, but I don't want to steal any attention away from America.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14154","Barney","Abby, I've... I've got some bad news. I can't marry you.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14155","Abby","What?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14156","Barney","Ted begged me not to. I think he's in love with you.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14157","Abby","Really?","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14158","Barney","Yes, our plan worked better than we ever dreamed. You have to go to him. Here's his home address. But you know what? He works late, so I wouldn't go before 2 00 or 3 00 in the morning.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14159","Abby","Oh, my God, thank you. But now I feel wrong keeping this.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14160","Barney","Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that. That's made of candy. Later.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14161","Marshall","Hey, go to lilyandmarshallselltheirstuff.com or charityfolks.com.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14162","Lily","We're having an auction to rise money for the children's hospital of Los Angeles","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14163","Marshall","You could get tons of cool stuff on the sell and they all use for great cause.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14164","Lily & Marshall","Thanks.","03","19","Everything Must Go"
"14165","It's 10","00 in the morning.","03","20","Miracles"
"14166","God sent those lice to my head like he sent the locusts to Egypt","NA God sent those lice to my head like he sent the locusts to Egypt","03","20","Miracles"
"14167","I know what he saw","boobs. Scotch.","03","20","Miracles"
"14168","Ted(2030)","Kids, there is something I wish my dad told me. The longest pause you will ever experience in your life is the one that follows asking the question...","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14169","Ted","Will you marry me?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14170","Ted(2030)","Your brain goes into overdrive, imaging every possible response.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14171","Stella","No.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14172","Stella","Oh, God, no.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14173","Stella","You want me to marry..(laughing).No.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14174","Stella","Oh, I'm sorry, Ted. I can't. Mark Johnson, the quarterback from your high school football team, already asked me.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14175","Mark Johnson","What's up, Turd?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14176","Ted","It's Ted!","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14177","Ted (2030)","But if you're lucky, she may answer with the single greatest word in the English language.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14178","Stella","Yes.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14179","Ted (2030)","Stella and I spent that summer happily engaged. Marshall was still coping with unemployment.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14180","Marshall to lily","What are you doing?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14181","Ted(2030)","Lily threw herself into her painting.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14182","Marshall to Barney","What are you doing?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14183","Ted(2030)","Barney was rehabilitating from his bus accident.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14184","Marshall to himself","What are you doing?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14185","Ted(2030)","And well, Marshall just kept coping with unemployment.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14186","Marshall to Robin","What are you doing?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14187","Ted(2030)","And Robin continued to uphold the high journalistic standards of Metro News 1.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14188","Robin","Is your favorite brand of dental floss poisoning your entire family? Tune in at 11 00 for the shocking... Tooth.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14189","Robin","Okay, I officially hate my job. I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who shows up at night and scares people. I'm the bogeyman with a teleprompter.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14190","Barney","""Bogeyman with a teleprompter."" That's hilarious! Great joke, Robin, great joke.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14191","Lily","Barney, no offense to Robin, but that wasn't that funny.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14192","Barney","Are you kidding? That was a great joke. It's smart, funny, beautiful, the whole package. It's everything you're afraid to let yourself want. In a joke. ""Bogeyman with a teleprompter."" Classic.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14193","Lily","Okay, what is so urgent that you called me and begged me to come over at 7 22 in the morning?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14194","Barney","I could tell you knew something was up with me, and you're right. But I can't tell you what it is. I should tell you, but I can't! I have to. I never will! I'm going to. Let's just drop it. What's up with you?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14195","Lily","Barney, just say it.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14196","Barney","I think I'm in love with Robin.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14197","Marshall","Hey, Lily needs some gift ideas for Stella's wedding shower. Does she like to cook?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14198","Ted","Actually, I don't know.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14199","Marshall","What's her favorite color?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14200","Ted","Don't know that either.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14201","Marshall","Well, does she have any hobbies?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14202","Ted","Yes. She's exactly the kind of person who would have hobbies. And interests, too. I am one lucky son of a bitch.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14203","Marshall","Dude, you don't know anything about the woman you're marrying.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14204","Ted","What? You're crazy! I know plenty.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14205","Marshall","What color are her eyes?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14206","Ted","The color of the ocean after a storm.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14207","Marshall","Which is?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14208","Ted","Beautiful.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14209","Lily","I don't believe it. I thought you called me over here to uncuff you from your s*x swing again, but you're in love? That is so sweet!","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14210","Barney","It's not ""sweet."" It's like a disease. I slept with Robin one time and I caught feelings. I caught feelings bad. I used protection and everything.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14211","Lily","Barney, you don't ""catch"" feelings, you just have them. And they're good.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14212","Barney","They're terrible! I can't eat, I can't sleep. She's all I think about. I close my eyes, I see Robin. I, I hear a song; it reminds me of Robin.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14213","Girl","Morning.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14214","Barney","I sleep with that chick, I'm thinking about Robin.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14215","Ted","Okay, so I don't know every single detail about Stella. What's really about? Do you not like her or something?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14216","Marshall","No, Ted, I like Stella a lot. She's a Mets fan.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14217","Ted","Really?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14218","Marshall","It's just that everything with you has moved so fast. You've only known each other a few months. Don't you think maybe you should slow things down a little bit? Get to know each other better?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14219","Ted","I'll have a whole life time to get to know her better. Right now, I know the one thing that I have to  that I love her.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14220","Lily","You love her? Barney, how can you be in love, and still be sleeping with anything that moves?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14221","Barney","I'm sorry, I don't follow you. That's like saying, ""How can an ant carry ""20 times its body weight, but root beer floats are still delicious?"" Are the two even related? Really?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14222","Lily","Barney, you're going to have to stop screwing around if you want to be Robin's boyfriend.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14223","Barney","""Boyfriend""? I don't want to be Robin's boyfriend.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14224","Lily","Well, what do you want, then?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14225","Barney","I don't know. I just want to be with her. All the time. I want to hear about her day and tell her about mine. I want to hold her hand and smell her hair. But I don't want to be her stupid boyfriend.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14226","Lily","Barney, what you just described is a relationship between a boyfriend and a girlfriend. And a pretty clingy one at that.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14227","Barney","Look, Lily, are you going to help me out with this or not?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14228","Lily","I'm a kindergarten teacher. I see a confused, little kid in the corner trying to eat the lefty scissors, I gotta help the poor, little b*st*rd. But only if you stop sleeping around. Deal?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14229","Barney","Deal.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14230","Robin","Coming up next, is your local ice cream man actually driving a roving meth lab on wheels? Stay tuned for the full... Scoop. Really?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14231","Stella","I know dudes think it's girlie for a guy to cook, but us ladies? We find it mighty sexy.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14232","Ted","Really? You know... My grandma taught me how.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14233","Stella","Oh, yeah, she did.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14234","Ted","Yeah. I had a lot of time after school to watch her cook because I wasn't good at sports.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14235","Stella","I'm on fire right now. Delicious. What's in this pesto?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14236","Ted","Oh, you know, the usual  basil, garlic, olive oil, but can you guess my secret ingredient?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14237","Stella","Peanuts.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14238","Ted","Yes. How did you know that?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14239","Ted","OK, let me think, what else?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14240","Stella","You know what, sweetie? I woke up so early and I had a really long day at work. And there was that whole thing where you tried to kill me. Can we please just go to sleep?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14241","Ted","No, I clearly need to know more about you. Let's do firsts. First kiss?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14242","Stella","Dale Harris, second grade. You're talking like peck on the cheek or a full-on passionate making out?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14243","Stella","OK, yeah, Dale Harris, second grade.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14244","Ted","First time you had s*x.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14245","Stella","Dale Harris, second...","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14246","Ted","Stop it.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14247","Stella","Billy Devito, sophomore year of college.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14248","Ted","Prude. Molly McKenzie, junior year of high school.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14249","Stella","Slut.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14250","Lily","Robin just needs to see this new see of you.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14251","Barney","So just call her up?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14252","Lily","Just call her up.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14253","Barney (on the phone)","Hi, Robin..(he jabbers something and hang up) She wasn't there. I left a voice mail.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14254","Lily","You left a voice, but it wasn't male. Barney, I don't get it. You've called a million girls a million times.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14255","Barney","Yeah, but those were just booty calls.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14256","Barney (present)","On a booty call, you barely even have to talk. Around 9 00 p.m., you say...","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14257","Barney","Hey, baby, it's Barney. You busy tonight? Sweet. See you in half an hour? Can't wait.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14258","Barney (present)","But the later it gets, the fewer words you need.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14259","Barney (present)","And by 3 00 in the morning...","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14260","Barney","Sweet.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14261","Lily","A question mark? You got laid off a question mark?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14262","Barney","It's no worse than your super-obvious code words.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14263","Lily","Rhinoceros.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14264","Marshall","We have to go.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14265","Lily","Great. Now we need a new code word.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14266","Barney","Ah, ah, it's her, it's Robin. What do I do? No-no-no-no, aah! Robin... Great to hear from you. To what do I owe the pleasure?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14267","Robin","You called, said..., and hung up. What do you want?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14268","Barney (to lily)","Help me!","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14269","Lily","Just ask her something.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14270","Barney","How are you feeling today?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14271","Robin","Fine.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14272","Lily","Something personal.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14273","Barney","At what age did you first get your period?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14274","Robin","Did you just ask me about about my period?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14275","Barney","No, I did not.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14276","Robin","Look, Barney, I'm at work right now.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14277","Lily","Just ask her out.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14278","Barney","Robin, I was wondering if... Nothing. Gotta go. Bye. That was just a practical joke. I'm not really in love with Robin. You should've seen the look on your face. There's cameras right there and there and there. What a legendary prank that we're never going to speak of again.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14279","Lily","Gross.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14280","Ted","First movie you ever saw.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14281","Stella","Benji,1981. I watched it recently with Lucy and I just thought, ""Oh, that dog is so dead right now."" What about you?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14282","Ted","My dad took me to an old drive-in to see the original Star Wars.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14283","Stella","You know, I've actually never seen Star Wars.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14284","Marshall","She's never seen Star Wars?! Ted, the only people in the universe who haven't seen Star Wars are the characters, and that's 'cause they lived them. That's 'cause they lived theStar Wars.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14285","Ted","You've got to calm down.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14286","Marshall","I told you. You didn't know this girl well enough. What if... you show it to her, she doesn't like it?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14287","Ted","Dude, it's just a movie.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14288","Marshall","Star Wars is your all-time favorite movie, and whether or not Stella likes it is actually important. It's like, it's a test of how compatible you guys are.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14289","Ted","It's just a movie. It's just a movie!","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14290","Ted","If Stella doesn't like this movie, I can't marry her.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14291","Marshall","You can't.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14292","Ted","You want to watch it again?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14293","Marshall","I do.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14294","Barney","Where are the boys? I thought this was a group thing.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14295","Lily","I lied. They're not coming and I'm about to leave.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14296","Barney","Why?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14297","Lily","Because... they're not in love with Robin, and neither am I. I mean, she's great and sweet. I'm not going to pretend that I haven't noticed her body, but this is off topic. Good luck.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14298","Barney","Wait, wait, I can't do this. She'll never take me seriously. She thinks I'm some womanizing idiot.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14299","Lily","We both know you're more than that. Show Robin the Barney I met the other day.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14300","Barney","You mean the insecure, touchy-feely she-male who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14301","Lily","Ted hit that for over a year.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14302","Barney","Wish me luck.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14303","Ted","I just thought it'd be fun to watch a movie tonight, and since you've never seen Star Wars, I figured why not? No big deal. It's pretty good.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14304","Stella","Sounds like a plan. I'm gonna grab a beer. You want one?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14305","Ted","The movie's already started, so...","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14306","Stella","It's some words flying through space. I'm not going to read that anyway.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14307","Ted","Oh, my God. Marshall appears behind the couch.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14308","Marshall","Off to a bad start.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14309","Ted","What are you doing down there?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14310","Marshall","I'm making sure my best friend is marrying the right woman. That's what I'm doing.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14311","Ted","What are you doing, hiding behind the couch? You need to get a job.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14312","Marshall","I really do, don't I?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14313","Barney","So, Robin... tell me about your day, and not just what happened, how you felt about what happened.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14314","Robin","What?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14315","Barney","I'm not looking to problem-solve, I'm just looking to listen.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14316","Robin","Why are you acting like this?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14317","Barney","Like what?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14318","Robin","You're being super nice. It's... freaking me out. Be... gross, be inappropriate. Be Barney.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14319","Barney","I'm being Barney, and I think tonight's going to be de... wait for it... lightful. Delightful.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14320","Robin","Right. So I went to the chiropractor yesterday. That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14321","Barney","Is insurance going to cover that? Sometimes they don't.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14322","Robin","That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14323","Barney","Your teeth look fantastic.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14324","Robin","Who are you?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14325","Stella","What?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14326","Ted","Nothing.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14327","Stella","You were staring at me.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14328","Ted","You look really beautiful tonight.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14329","Stella","You don't look so bad yourself, mister. She kisses him on the neck","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14330","Ted","Great scene, great scene. Star Wars fun fact number seven... George Lucas based the film's structure on Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. He also owes a debt to Campbell's work with comparative mythology.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14331","Stella","Yeah, Ted, I'm losing wood over here. What's going on?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14332","Ted","Nothing.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14333","Stella","Wait, it's really important to you that I like this movie, isn't it? I'm not gonna like it with you staring at me the whole time. Go to your room and I will come get you when it's over. Go.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14334","Marshall","Should I leave, too?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14335","Ted","What part, what part?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14336","Barney","Thanks.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14337","Robin","Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14338","Barney","I don't always want to be that guy. Sometimes I want to be someone you can have an actual conversation with. Now, tell me something about you that I don't know yet. Seriously.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14339","Robin","There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14340","Barney","Why not?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14341","Robin","Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14342","Barney","We both know you're more than that. Promise me you'll apply.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14343","Robin","It's not as easy...","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14344","Barney","Promise me you'll apply.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14345","Robin","I promise.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14346","Marshall","She's up to the scene where Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy escape from the Death Star's trash compactor.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14347","Ted","Great scene.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14348","Marshall","Great scene! Okay, we should have just heard... but Stella didn't make a peep.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14349","Ted","I'm gonna take a look. She's not even watching. She's texting.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14350","Marshall","I'll tell her you still want to be friends.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14351","Ted","I don't believe this. I believe, she knows this is important to me. She's blatantly...(Ted looks at his phone) ""Stop watching me, jackasses.""","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14352","Barney","To taking chances.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14353","Robin","To taking chances.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14354","Barney","You know, Robin, there's actually something, I do want to talk to you about.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14355","Barman","Last call.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14356","Barney","Of course it is. One more for the road?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14357","Robin","Yeah, why not? Hold that thought?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14358","Stella","I loved it.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14359","Ted","Yes! I am marrying a woman who is not only hot but loves Star Wars. That's the dream.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14360","Stella","What was that?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14361","Ted","I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me through the space-time continuum. We did it. We did it, you m*st*rb*t*ng little b*st*rd. Champagne for everybody. Ted leaves the room.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14362","Stella","It was so good.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14363","Marshall","You hated it, didn't you?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14364","Stella","It's so stupid. First of all, how do they understand that walking bear they hang around with all the time?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14365","Marshall","Wookiee.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14366","Stella","He goes nin nin nin... They're all like, ""That's a good point, Bear, ""let's try that.""","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14367","Marshall","He's a Wookiee, and his kind is actually more intelligent than they appear. That is Ted's favorite movie of all time. He watches it when he's home sick with the flu. He watches it on rainy Sunday afternoons in the fall. He watches it on Christmas Eve. Ted watches Star Wars in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad. Do you really think that you can pretend to like a movie that you actually hate for the rest of your life?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14368","Stella","I do.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14369","Marshall","Then, Ted's a lucky guy. Bear.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14370","Barney","So, here's the deal.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14371","Robin","April, have... you met Barney? April just finished her shift, she's looking to blow off some steam.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14372","Barney","Would you excuse us for one sec? What are you doing?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14373","Robin","You were so nice to me tonight, I wanted to return the favor, wingwoman-style. So, as I was saying, Barney is the Yankees' new second-baseman. And Barney, April asked if tomorrow, you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match. You can't make this stuff up. So, you two kids have fun.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14374","April","So are you... nervous about the game?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14375","Barney","Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not. I'm just some guy who's in love with the girl that just left, and she's never going to feel the same way. So I'm just going to go.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14376","Barney","And that was it.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14377","Lily","I'm so sorry, Barney. You can't give up. You know, it may take some time, but once Robin sees the new you...","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14378","April","When my family gets to Yankee Stadium, are the tickets under your name or mine?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14379","Barney","My name, and tell your nephews to bring their mitts. They're going to be in foul ball country. Come on. The Robin stuff was completely true.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14380","Lily","Damn it, Barney. I mean, for the last time, you can't... you can't be in love with Robin and still be sleeping with every bimbo on the planet. You have to choose right now.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14381","Barney","I choose bimbos.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14382","Lily","What?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14383","Barney","Bimbos make me happy. Bimbos make me feel alive. Bimbos make me want to pretend to be a better man. This whole thing with Robin was just a fling, but at the end of the day, my heart belongs to bimbos.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14384","Lily","This is just a defense mechanism, because you're afraid of getting hurt. You're just confused.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14385","Barney","Oh, I'm not confused. You know who is confused? Bimbos. They're easily confused. It's one of the thousand little things I love about them. I love their vacant, trusting stares, their sluggish, unencumbered minds, their unresolved daddy issues. I love them and they love me. Bimbos have always been there for me, through thick and thin. Mostly thin. B- man don't do thick crust. What up?","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14386","Lily","See you, Barney.","04","01","Do I Know You?"
"14387","Ted from 2030","When I first moved to New York, it was dingy, disgusting, ugly, flea-ridden, stinky and altogether terrifying, but then, sadly. The whole city started to go uphill. The streets got a little cleaner, the rents got a little higher, and one by one, the crappy old places we loved began to disappear. The Elbow Room, an old punk rock club, became a drugstore. McHale's, a working-class watering hole, became a fast-food place. And Fez, a Moroccan-themed lounge, became a bank. And not just any bank.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14388","Barney","Goliath National Bank. The world leader in credit and banking. God, I love Goliath National Bank!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14389","Ted","Okay, first of all, you look like the last pick in the draft. And, second, why are you so excited about some bank?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14390","Barney","Our company just bought them out in a ruthless takeover. Took two months. Cost 2,000 jobs. It was brutal. Who wants a T-shirt? (He throws one to Ted.) Hey, Marshall, they're hiring in the legal department. I could get you a job.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14391","Lily","Barney, Marshall didn't quit his last soul-sucking corporate job just to go work at a bank. He's gonna be an environmental lawyer.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14392","Ted from 2030","That was the plan, anyway. (We can see Marshall in front of the mirror of the bathroom.) Over the next few weeks, Marshall went on a lot of interviews.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14393","Marshall (to the mirror)","You are confident, you are energetic, you are focused!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14394","Ted from 2030","A lot of interviews.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14395","Marshall(to the mirror)","You are flexible on salary, you're willing to compromise, you're not gonna cry this time.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14396","Ted from 2030","Too many interviews.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14397","Marshall(to the mirror)","You are sad, you are beaten down, you will get through this, come home, get in your big underpants and take a nap.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14398","Ted from 2030","Which brings us to September 29, the night of the burger.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14399","Ted","So, what do you guys want to do for dinner?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14400","Wendy","Oh, we just got a new cook. You have to try the burger, it's amazing.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14401","Robin","Great, we'll take five of those.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14402","Wendy (taking note)","Five burgers.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14403","Ted","Really? You want to eat here?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14404","Robin","Yeah, I'm freaking starving. I just finished a seven-day cleanse.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14405","Marshall","I thought you started that yesterday.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14406","Robin","I finished early, OK? (To Wendy) Five of those.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14407","Wendy","Five burgers.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14408","Ted","Wait. What about sushi?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14409","Lily","We had sushi last night.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14410","Barney","Italian.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14411","Ted","I had Italian for lunch.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14412","Wendy","I can come back.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14413","Robin","No. We always do this. We spend an hour arguing about where to eat, and we end up here anyway. I haven't eaten for two days. Can we please, for the love of God, just order something now?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14414","Ted","Chinese?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14415","Robin","Oh.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14416","Barney","I don't like Chinese.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14417","Ted","Indian?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14418","Barney","I just said I don't like Chinese.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14419","Ted","Indian isn't Chinese.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14420","Barney","Weird meats, funny music, side of rice. Why are we splitting hairs?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14421","Ted","Mexican?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14422","Barney","I just said I don't like Chinese.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14423","Robin","God.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14424","Wendy","Robin, yours will be right out.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14425","Robin","Of course, mine comes last. Go ahead, start without me.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14426","Everybody","Sweet! You shouldn't have. That's so kind of you.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14427","Lily","My God. This burger is so good. It's like Christmas in my mouth, meat Christmas.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14428","Ted","It's like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's. Where the chef killed it and ran it through the meat grinder.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14429","Barney","I love this burger so much, I want to sew my ass shut.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14430","Marshall","It's okay.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14431","Everybody","Are you kidding me?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14432","Marshall","Guys, guys, guys. When you've had the best burger in NY, every other burger tastes like my grandpa's feet. But you guys eat up, enjoy my grandpa's feet.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14433","Robin","And you've had the best burger in New York?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14434","Marshall","It was eight years ago, my first week in New York, and for a kid from Minnesota, the big city was a scary place.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14435","Marshall","Oh, thank God it's just you.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14436","Ted","You are being ridiculous. (Taking the bat.) Tell me, you left the apartment today?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14437","Marshall","Why would I have to leave? I can have anything I want delivered, and New York City cable is awesome. Have you seen this public access show with the old Jewish lady in a bikini? (Laughing) It's disgusting.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14438","Ted","Marshall, you have to get over this paranoia. You are not gonna get mugged.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14439","Marshall","What if I do, Ted. I don't have a switchblade. I don't know how to break-dance and win the begrudging respect of a street gang.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14440","Ted","That's it, you're taking a walk. Come on, go.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14441","Marshall","No. Look, the old lady in a bikini is back on. I'm just gonna lie back and get comfortable.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14442","Ted","Go outside, go, go.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14443","Marshall","Okay. (He takes the bat discreetly.)","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14444","Ted","Leave the bat.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14445","Marshall","Fine.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14446","Marshal","So I went for a walk in the big, scary city. And I discovered something amazing  it wasn't scary at all. All right. What's the word?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14447","Man in the street (Distributing pamphlets)","Your search is over!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14448","Marshall","And then, right when I started to get a little hungry, I turned a corner...","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14449","Marshall","And there it was.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14450","Barney","Name two places where things get stuffed.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14451","Marshall","So, I went inside.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14452","Marshall voiceover","And I ordered the burger.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14453","Marshal","Thank you.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14454","Marshall","Ted, you got to wake up. Wake...","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14455","Ted","Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Are you okay?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14456","Marshall","I'm all right. Ted, I've just had the most amazing burger of my life! It's this awesome little place, Regis Philbin eats there, so it's sort of like a celebrity hot spot. But the burger. The burger. Dude.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14457","Ted","I want one of those burgers right now! Do you think they're still open?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14458","Marshall","I don't know. (Looking to his watch.) Does stuff in New York stay open past... 9 30?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14459","Marshall voiceover","So we went out to get another burger. But after hours of searching...","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14460","Marshall (Raising hands in the sky.)","Damn it! Where is this place?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14461","Robin","You couldn't find it?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14462","Ted","We didn't know our way around. Just getting back to the apartment took us three hours and one very helpful drag queen.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14463","Marshall","Wait, Penny Noir was a drag queen?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14464","Robin","Where do you think it was?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14465","Lily","Probably tucked between her legs.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14466","Barney","You know what's not a drag? Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14467","Marshall","Anyways, we never found the place. Now, eight years have passed, still... No burger.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14468","Man","I couldn't help but overhear.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14469","Marshall","Okay, here we go.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14470","Man","I know the place you're talking about.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14471","Marshall","No, you don't.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14472","Man","It's a place called the Corner Bistro. Greatburger.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14473","Marshall","Oh, the Corner Bistro! It's amazing, I spent a quarter of my life searching for the best burger in New York City, but silly me, it never occurred to me to check the highest-rated burger in the Zagat guide. Wow, thanks a lot, guy. Let me return the favor. Great cup of coffee  Starbucks.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14474","Robin","So I take it you've tried the Corner Bistro.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14475","Marshall","Robin, I've tried every so-called best burger in New York City trying to find that burger. Or at least forget about her.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14476","Marshall (getting up)","We're going.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14477","Marshall","But none of those places even came close.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14478","Ted","There was that one time we thought we had a break in the case, remember?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14479","Barney","Get this. You know who works out at my gym? Regis Philbin.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14480","Marshall (Watching Ted)","The autographed picture.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14481","Regis Philbin (Lifting weights)","Of course I remember the place. It was the best burger I ever had. I still have dreams about this burger. Beautiful, haunting dreams! I wake up at night screaming, ""Get out of my head, burger! Get out!""","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14482","Marshall","That's the one, Mr. Philbin. Do you remember where it is?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14483","Regis Philbin(He knocks in a bag of boxing.)","No! I never wrote it down. But not a day goes by that I don't regret it. (To Marshall) Why? Why? Do you know where it is?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14484","Marshall","No.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14485","Regis Philbin (Threatening him with his fists.)","And if you tell me it's at the Corner Bistro, I'm gonna smack you right in the face!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14486","Barney","No. No, we don't know where it is.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14487","Regis Philbin (Taking Barney by the collar)","Listen, Blondie! Don't mess with me! Daddy needs his meat.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14488","Barney","I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14489","Regis Philbin (To Marshall)","What about you, Lurch? (To Ted) And what about you, satchel-mouth? (Giving a card to Barney) This is my cell. You find that burger; you call me day or night.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14490","Barney","OK, Regis, we will, we will.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14491","Regis Philbin","What are you waiting for? Get out and find the burger!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14492","Barney","All right.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14493","Regis Philbin","Let's go, all of you!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14494","Marshall","That's where my story ends. Now I'm doomed to walk the earth forever searching for that green door and that red neon sign that says ""Burger.""","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14495","Robin","Green door, red neon sign that says ""Burger?""","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14496","Marshall","Yeah.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14497","Robin","I know that place. I've walked by it a million times. It's on West 12th, right off of 7th.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14498","Marshall","I knew it was on a numbered street!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14499","Robin","Finally.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14500","Marshall (taking Robin's burger in his hands)","No! Robin! If any of us is gonna eat a burger tonight, it's gonna be the best burger in New York. We're going downtown! He throws away the burger.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14501","Robin","No...","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14502","Marshall","I cannot believe we're finally gonna have this burger","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14503","Lily","Honey, I'm so excited for you. After all these interviews, after all these disappointments, you deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14504","Barney","You know what else is a mouthful? All that double-talk other banks give you. At Goliath, customer satisfaction is our most important investment.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14505","Lily","Barney, I hate to break this to you, but working for a bank's kind of lame.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14506","Barney","How lame is free automatic bill pay? How lame is 3.3% APY online savings? Yeah, that's right. Hate to make you look stupid in front of your friends, but you left me no choice. He laughs.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14507","Ted","We should probably call Regis.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14508","Barney","Reg... (He takes his phone.) That guy scares me. I think I'll leave him a text.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14509","""Million Dollar","Heads or Tails"" - Studio set","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14510","Regis Philbin","Now, Kathy, your last flip was heads. The one before that was tails. You polled the audience; they came out split, 50/50. No help at all there. So, for $258,000... I have to ask you, Kathy, what's it gonna be  heads...or... (His phone rings, he reads the text and starts to leave the studio.) Excuse me. Oh, boy. I've got to go. I've got to go!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14511","Marshall","Green door, red neon sign. Guys, this is the place. I've actually, I prepared a few words.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14512","Robin (On nerves)","I will eat your hand.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14513","Marshall","Let's just go inside then. Shall we?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14514","Marshall (to the waitress)","Thank you.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14515","Waitress","Yours will be right out.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14516","Robin","Please, go ahead, start.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14517","Robin","Just shut up and eat.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14518","Barney","All right.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14519","Ted","Oh my god. I'm never brushing my teeth again unless it's with a toothbrush made from this burger.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14520","Lily","I think I just had my first burg-asm.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14521","Barney","I want... to take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie, then take it back to my place, put on a little Terence Trent D'arby, and then I would just... fool around a little bit. Nothing serious, just take it slow, you know?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14522","Marshall (putting his burger in his plate)","This isn't it.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14523","Everybody","What?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14524","Marshall","It's not it.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14525","Ted","Marshall, you might not want to hear this, but... is it at all possible this is the same","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14526","Robin","I mean, it is just a burger.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14527","Marshall","Just a burger? It's so much more than just a burger. I mean, that first bite... Oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like a sesame-freckled breast of an angel, resting gently on the ketchup and mustard below. Flavors mingling in a seductive ""pas de deux"". And then... a pickle the most... playful... little pickle, and then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce, and a... a patty... of ground beef, so... exquisite...swirling in your mouth, breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savories so... delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread. This is God... speaking to us through food.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14528","Lily","And you got our wedding vows off the Internet.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14529","Marshall","Okay, look, so, so this, this isn't the place. All right, it's no big deal. It's another place with a green door and a red neon sign that says ""Burger"". I'll just... I'll call every restaurant in Manhattan and ask 'em what colour their door is. No big deal, right? Let's do this.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14530","Robin","I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this isn't just about a burger.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14531","Lily","Marshall's not doing so well, guys. He really needs to get a job.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14532","Ted","Tell them about the underpants.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14533","Robin","What about the underpants?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14534","Lily","It started a couple of weeks ago.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14535","Marshall","Heads! It's going to be heads. It's almost usually heads.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14536","Lily","Hey, baby.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14537","Marshall","Hey!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14538","Lily","Did you put on pants today?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14539","Marshall","Nope. They laugh.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14540","Lily","It was funny at first, but then it became a daily thing. I thought, ""Okay, well, at least he's not leaving the house like that."" Then, one day, he opened the door to get the paper. Day after that, went downstairs to get the mail.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14541","Ted","Everyone's got an underpants radius. For most of us, it's the distance from the bedroom to the bathroom, but as your self-esteem gets smaller, your underpants radius gets bigger.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14542","Robin","How big is Marshall's underpants radius?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14543","Marshall","We're going.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14544","Ted","Come on, Lily, he'll find a job eventually.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14545","Barney","You know, Lil, when times are tough, I like to remember the uplifting words of my favourite song. He starts singing. ""We'll be on your side when you need a friend. Through thick and thin you can always depend. On the world leaders in credit and banking. Goliath National Bank."" Member FDIC.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14546","Lily","We've got to find Marshall that burger.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14547","Ted","Lily, I think we're all eating that burger.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14548","Robin","I'm not eating that burger.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14549","Lily","No, if Marshall says this isn't the burger, this isn't it.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14550","Robin","Finally.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14551","Lily","Excuse me. Did you guys change cooks or something? Because my husband was here 5 years ago, he's sure he had a different burger. Robin is trying to take the plate.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14552","Waitress","Yeah, we get this a lot. This place is modelled after this other place uptown with the same green door and ""Burger"" sign.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14553","Ted","What? Uptown? Where?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14554","Waitress","106th and Manhattan Avenue.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14555","Robin","Damn it.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14556","Marshall","106. A numbered street. Of course.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14557","Barney","Barney Stinson.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14558","Regis Philbin (in front of the last restaurant)","Barney, where the hell are you?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14559","Barney","I'm sorry, this is...?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14560","Regis Philbin","Regis. I'm at the place.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14561","Barney","Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14562","Regis Philbin","What? Uptown? He breaks a mail box. Fine, fine, I'll be there in 20. If you get there first, medium rare.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14563","Barney","Onions?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14564","Regis Philbin (screaming)","Onions?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14565","Barney","Okay, no onions.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14566","Marshall","Stop the cab!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14567","Marshall","Wait. This is it.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14568","Man in the streets","Your search is over. We got girls taking off their clothes.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14569","Marshall","This is it.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14570","Barney","One of 9,000 convenient locations.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14571","Marshall","It was ri... it was right here. It was... it was right on this very spot.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14572","Robin","I don't understand. Where is the burger place?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14573","Ted","It's not a burger place anymore; it's a Goliath National Bank ATM.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14574","Robin (getting crazy)","That's fine. Let's just eat here.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14575","Ted","We can't eat here. It's an ATM.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14576","Robin","But... food.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14577","Barney","What the...","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14578","Lily","This is your fault, you and your stupid bank. You did this.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14579","Barney","It's not my... Stop, okay. She hits his knee. Stop that, Lily.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14580","Lily","I will never use a Goliath ATM ever again. Goliath National Bank sucks. It's the worst bank on the face of the earth. Attention, New Yorkers, this bank sucks! They suck!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"

"14582","Lily","They suck, suck!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14583","Barney","Will you just tell her already?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14584","Lily","Tell me what? Tell me what?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14585","Marshall","I got a job.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14586","Lily","What? Where?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14587","Marshall","Goliath National Bank. That's why Barney's been going on and on about how, how great Goliath is. He wanted you to be excited for me since we will to working together.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14588","Barney","Well, technically not together. You won't have access to my floor.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14589","Lily","But you want to be an environmental lawyer.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14590","Marshall","Yeah and I also want to be a Harlem Globetrotter and get paid in candy, but in the meantime, I need a job, and this is, this is a really good one. It's great pay and there's good benefits, and to be honest, it gives me a reason to put on pants in the morning. You know, I have my whole life to save the planet, but right now I'm kind of really excited to wear pants again.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14591","Lily","You've got great pants.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14592","Marshall","I love you.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14593","Lily","I love you.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14594","Ted","Robin, no!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14595","Robin","They're unopened.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14596","Ted","Give it.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14597","Robin","They're barbecue.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14598","Ted","Give it!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14599","Lily","I'm sorry you didn't get your burger.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14600","Marshall","It's stupid. I think about that first week in New York. You know? I was 22 years old. I had my whole future ahead of me. I guess I just kind of thought that if I could have that burger one more time and feel that way for one more night, that I might be able to check that off the list, and grow up, go work for the stupid bank, and just... be happy.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14601","Man","You know, that burger place isn't gone. It just moved to a new location. And I can tell you where that is for a hundred bucks.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14602","Robin (Licking an envelope.)","A hundred bucks? That's crazy.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14603","Marshall","Let's pay the man.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14604","Lily","I paid for the cab.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14605","Ted","I have any cash.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14606","Marshall","I haven't worked since March.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14607","Barney","If only there were an easy, convenient way to get some cash right now.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14608","Barney","Member FDIC.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14609","Ted from 2030","So we paid the guy, and 20 minutes later...","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14610","Marshall","Thank you.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14611","Ted","All right, Marshall, remember. It might not taste as good. This place has changed, you've changed, New York has changed. Just... don't get your hopes up too high, okay?","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14612","Marshall","This is it.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14613","Everybody","Yes!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14614","Marshall","It's exactly the same. It's the best burger in New York. Go ahead, eat up, eat up.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14615","Ted from 2030","And so, after finally tasting again the burger he'd craved for so many years, Marshall got up the next morning, put on some pants, and went to work, and he never looked back.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14616","Lily","I want to get tiny fitted sheets for this burger, and just... crawl into this bun, get all cosy, and die there.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14617","Robin","Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14618","Barney","This feels so good. I'm worried I'm gonna get this burger pregnant.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14619","Marshall","If he does get that burger pregnant, I have dibs on the delicious burger babies.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14620","Regis Philbin","This isn't it.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14621","Everybody","What? Come on.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14622","Barney","That's outrageous.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14623","Regis","That is unbelievable. Wait. This is it!","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14624","Marshall","You were just freakin' teasing us.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14625","Regis","No, really.","04","02","The Best Burger in New York"
"14626","Ted (2030)","During the fall of 2008, I had a little problem.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14627","Barney","Well, I must go to Stella. Tonight is the big night. I tried before, I always failed. This time I will succeed. Tonight... I am a lesbian. Robin, your lipstick.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14628","Ted","Oh, no! Take pictures, okay?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14629","Barney","Hi, Ted.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14630","Ted (2030)","I lived in New York, but Stella was living across the river in New Jersey...","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14631","Ted","Oh, no!","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14632","Ted (2030)","... So I took the train all the time.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14633","Man","What's up, Ted?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14634","Ted","Hi, Matisse.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14635","Marshall","Theodore!","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14636","Barney","T-Diddy! You've missed that!","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14637","Lily","Robin has had the job of presenter.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14638","Robin","And we have a free bottle of champagne.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14639","Marshall","But it's empty now.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14640","Ted","Oh, no!","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14641","Ted (2030)","So, it was always as if I missed any.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14642","Stella","Sorry, we could not wait. It cooled.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14643","Ted","Oh, no!","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14644","Lucy","Hey, big.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14645","Ted","What's up, G?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14646","Stella","Are you okay?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14647","Ted","Yeah, okay. It's just that... You know, I want to spend time with you, with my friends. I seem to spend my life on the train.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14648","Stella","Exactly, why not you invited your friends to come here?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14649","Ted","It's a great idea.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14650","Marshall","You want us to go in New Jersey? Oh, that's great.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14651","Ted","Why?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14652","Barney","First, I no longer have my gold medallions. I sold them when they are out of date, 400 years ago.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14653","Ted","Lily?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14654","Lily","I'm sorry, Ted. I am a New Yorker pure juice. I am programmed to despise and hate New Jersey and all it represents. Why I say that? You hate him more than anyone.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14655","Ted","What? I love New Jersey. Why you say that?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14656","Ted","And then he walks past me. I hate you not respect the queue more than New Jersey. In fact, this is false. There's nothing I hate more than New Jersey.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14657","Ted","Great, huh?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14658","Marshall","It's waiting for you?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14659","Ted","No, it'll take a while. I have to drop a massive New Jersey.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14660","Ted","So New Jersey is not my favorite place. But when we get married, and they have moved in with me, I will never stay there. Unless I see the Giants and I evacuated New York or I get rid of a body.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14661","Lily","Ted, if you murdered me and bury me in New Jersey, I'll haunt thee for ever.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14662","Ted","And if I assassinate and bury you somewhere else?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14663","Lily","I'll leave you alone. I'm sure you had your reasons.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14664","Ted (2030)","Children, your Aunt Robin was tired of his job, tired of lousy production...","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14665","Robin","I am Robin Scherbatsky, and you look... (The Metro M falls) Etro New One to 23h. (Thus the one from 11 pm) And again at 1am.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14666","Ted (2030)","... tired of the stories she had to announce.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14667","Robin","So hurry up and vote for the cutest dog in New York.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14668","Ted (2030)","... and most of all, fed up with stupid puns.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14669","Robin","Four workers were electrocuted when a subway train derailed. Stay here for more... de-rail shocking. Joel, people died.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14670","Ted (2030)","So, when she knew she was national presenter, she could finally say the words she longed to say for years.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14671","Robin","Tonight is my last issue. I arrived in Metro New One as a small caterpillar. And for 4 years, this office was my cocoon.But tonight, I turned into a butterfly ambitious.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14672","Marshall","Why it looks silly? She had a stroke?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14673","Ted","Yeah, a stroke of genius. This speech is really good.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14674","Robin","With an eye on the horizon, a look at the truth, and an eye on you all.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14675","Lily","It's you who wrote, right?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14676","Ted","This is a modified version of one I did when I left the swim team because of an ear problem.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14677","Marshall","You wore towels.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14678","Ted","It's part of the team.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14679","Ted (2030)","This Saturday, when Robin left for his first day, we crossed the river to experience the amazing nightlife of New Jersey.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14680","Ted","Stella has not found a babysitter, you're stuck. Instead, we'll all stay here and it'll be awesome.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14681","Stella","Well, there are games, there are movies. And there shall be beer in the garage.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14682","Marshall","It's pathetic. It's Saturday night. We should get drunk in a bar. I know this sounds depressing, almost tragic, but it is a fact.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14683","Barney","Yeah, and I want another drink for this girl, Doris. I know I can ask this aircraft lesbian.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14684","Marshall","No snakes on that plane.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14685","Ted","Come on guys, you promised. We stay there and we try to have fun. We're all here. Being with friends. It's not that the primary?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14686","Lily","With the next train, you can be in McClaren's to 23h.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14687","Barney","You can be at 22h.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14688","Lily","No, I have to change. I'm not feeling in New Jersey.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14689","Stella","You really hate this part.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14690","Marshall","What? No!","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14691","Stella","No, I understand, you're New Yorkers, you need a bar.You could go to the coolest bar in the state, which is so close that you will not believe it. (They descend the basement) and bang, here. The coolest bar in New Jersey.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14692","Lily","Yeah, probably.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14693","Ted","That's great! We have darts. A half ping-pong. An aquarium. Look how it's getting a great night as planned. One could make the bait and watch them fight.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14694","Barney","No thank you. I play not with aquariums unless they are my two favorite animals  the pilot fish and torturlute. Did you see!","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14695","Ted","For torturlute? You're right.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14696","Barney","Marshall.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14697","Marshall","You deserve better than that.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14698","Barney","Lily.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14699","Lily","Not good enough.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14700","Barney","Stella.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14701","Stella","Sorry.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14702","Barney","I fall not rest until we not make me respect for another person's knuckles brushing against mine so sweet, but manly.Small, small... Small, small... Small... Who's the baby? Know that as long as it does not have what he wants. No, deserves.This fist will not waver. It... bow... not.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14703","Stella","Who wants to play Scrabble?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14704","Lily","Yes, why not.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14705","Stella","Look, the letter ""X"" is a bit difficult to read because a few years ago, she walked into my dog. You know, we should get a dog when you come to live here.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14706","Ted","When I what?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14707","Stella","Super. This is Robin.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14708","Lily","I thought they came to live with you.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14709","Ted","Me too. My God, I moved to New Jersey?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14710","Barney","Guys, I'm sure the dog had to soaring after swallowing the tablet X. Too good! Go!","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14711","Ted","I can not live here.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14712","Marshall","It's not so bad. You can put a mini fridge, there, and perhaps an air hockey.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14713","Barney","Air Hockey. Well done my fat.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14714","Ted","I speak of New Jersey in general, not the basement. She wants me moved? I do not get it. It was discussed there for months.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14715","Ted","I thought that after marriage, Lucy and you could sit here.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14716","Stella","Yeah, it could play in the fire escape, be friend with the guy who sleeps on a couch in the driveway, biking on Broadway. Great idea, Ted.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14717","Ted","I understand why they want to live in New Jersey when you can live in Manhattan? I thought my apartment was one of his reasons for marrying me.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14718","Barney","Seriously, I thought it was the only one. Too much!(Robin arrives in the basement) You're glowing. Tape the Barnacle.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14719","Robin","Stella has already warned me.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14720","Marshall","So, your first day?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14721","Robin","It was not.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14722","All","What?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14723","Robin","It was not my first day. I arrived and there were 20 people. In fact, I have not really got the job. I just had an interview.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14724","Barney","How so?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14725","Robin","I know. He told me that I had had it.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14726","Robin","I got it? I got it!","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14727","Voice","Let's be clear, when I say ""you"", I mean the interview.You have the interview. I do not want there to be confusion.You only maintenance. Not the job.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14728","Robin","Thank you! Thank you!","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14729","Robin","I'll call and beg Joel for giving me my job.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14730","Marshall","No!","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14731","Lily","You hate that job.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14732","Robin","It was not so bad.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14733","Lily","How they made you call the Hurricane Hector when he was pouring with rain?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14734","Robin","A cycorde.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14735","Marshall","You're in the eye of cycorde.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14736","Ted","Thank you.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14737","Barney","Naughty.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14738","Robin","That sucks, but I can do what? I will not have another job. You would have seen other women in the interview. They were all more experienced, more ""ethnic"". There was a black girl with blue eyes. How can I compete?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14739","Barney","You can not.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14740","Lily","You can compete with anyone. You're Robin Scherbatsky. Confident, strong, great. With super long legs that look great in shorts.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14741","Robin","I called Joel.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14742","Barney","If you call now, you'll regret it. I slept with me full of women who were then sent to graze and then decamped. And sometimes they take the phone and they call me and do it again. And when we finished, I see that look on their faces, that look that says they hate themselves and they would never have known. But if you could see this look... In fact, you can see that look, there is a video, http //www...","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14743","Robin","Come on. I will not call.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14744","Stella (descending)","not Drink Beer! I remember when I bought it. That was before she became pregnant with Lucy. You can go pick on PriceCo? While you will be there, get yourself a map. You surely will go there all the time.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14745","Barney","This is the look.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14746","Ted","I can not live here. I hate being here. I would kill myself.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14747","Marshall","New Jersey is not so bad. Stella has a lawn. You can have a lawn mower. They sell there. I've seen with a cup holder. I saw a deck chair with a cup holder. I even saw a hammock with a cup holder. You live in New Jersey, you will not have to hold a cup.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14748","Ted","It asks me no problem holding a cup, unlike you.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14749","Barney","I'll give you $ 100 for hitting my fist. $ 200.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14750","Lily","Drop it, Barney. Your arm should make you suffer.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14751","Barney","$ 10 000.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14752","Marshall","You'll be on the other side of the river. You'll be in New York all the time.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14753","Ted","I'm sorry. You are in New York?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14754","Woman","We lived in Manhattan.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14755","Ted","Are you in town?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14756","Woman","All the time.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14757","Marshall","You see? All the time.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14758","Ted","When was the last time?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14759","Man","We dined with O'Rourke.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14760","Ted","It's been closed for six years.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14761","Woman","It's been a while. Funny, not that we lack.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14762","Man","I guess is the New Jersey-vegans, now. Honey, look, T-shirt with dogs.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14763","Ted","I can not do that. I'll tell Stella she and Lucy are coming to town and that's it.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14764","Marshall","What do you think guys? Beagle, or Boston terrier?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14765","Lily","It's the tears?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14766","Barney","They are magnificent... manly tears of pain. They are not emotional. They are a little emotional.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14767","Lily","Where is Robin?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14768","Robin","Shirley, this is Robin. I called Joel.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14769","Barney","Robin, hangs up. Do not do that.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14770","Robin","Sorry, I know, OK?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14771","Lily","If you hang up no...","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14772","Robin","Stop! Joel, this is Robin.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14773","Joel","So, Ms. Papillon wants to return to his cocoon.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14774","Robin","I'm sorry for saying all this stuff.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14775","Joel","You can put your socks with your apology, for you have already been replaced. Brian is the makeup and it could not be more excited.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14776","Biran","I can not do that. I can not do that.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14777","Joel","Look, although I want to see what college is over for the camera, if you can be here for the 23h, you can get your job.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14778","Robin","Ok, I have half an hour to arrive at the studio.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14779","Lily","You can never be in town in 30 minutes.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14780","Barney","Do not do it. It's scary to bet on itself, if you do not, nobody will. I'm not saying that to pat my fist. Even if a punch would be great. I mean it.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14781","Robin","I bet on me. I bet I can be there for 23h.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14782","She leaves home and takes Stella the bike that is on the porch. It is 10","31 p.m.. Marshall and Ted back.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14783","Stella","You got the beer?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14784","Ted","Yeah, I took a pack of 144. The rest is in the trunk.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14785","Stella","And you registered?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14786","Ted","No.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14787","Stella","Why?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14788","Ted","Was in line for the pictures, my hair is in the air... I want to live in New Jersey.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14789","Stella","What?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14790","Ted","I can not. And I see no reason that you did not come to New York.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14791","Stella","My daughter goes to school here. All his friends are here. I have lived here all my life. My whole family is here. This is my house. I'm at the EPA. And since June 1, I am the deputy mayor.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14792","Ted","Yes, but my apartment is close to the Metro.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14793","Stella","It moves not, end of discussion.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14794","Ted","How does it ""end of discussion""? It never was.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14795","Stella","That's what being a parent. I want to uproot Lucy.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14796","Ted","People with kids are moving all the time. It would be great for Lucy to grow up in the largest city in the world.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14797","Stella","It is. New York is the largest city in the world. Where the dream come true and of pigeon sh1t tastes like tapioca. Want a little secret? New Jersey... is better than New York.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14798","Ted","Better than...? You think...? I... The Empire State Buil...H and H Bage... The center Linco... Zabar's... Papaya King.New York is the cultural and intellectual center of the planet.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14799","Stella","New York is full of crazies, snobs and bad people. You know that once an old woman called me a slut and gave me a cat in his face? And you want to know if it's the same in New Jersey? 86th and Lex, right in front of your dear little Papaya King. The people of New Jersey are nice. This is the kind of place where you know your neighbors.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14800","Ted","Hey, I know my neighbors!","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14801","Stella","Yes, that kind?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14802","Ted","At the other end of the hall, there is... Clax... pa... I.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14803","Stella","Claxpamon?","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14804","Lily","It is called Paxton.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14805","Ted","I love this guy.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14806","10","47 p.m., Robin is the bike on the train.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14807","Robin","Sorry, I'm in a hurry. I go to before I go down first.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14808","Matisse","Do not spill Matisse.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14809","Lily","Ok, this is crazy. You can not believe that New Jersey is better than New York. In New York, there was Broadway. No need to say more.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14810","Barney","Oh, yes. Tape for safety.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14811","Stella","It was Atlantic City.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14812","Barney","You can not beat A.C. Pity! Nobody needs to know.","04","03","I Heart NJ"
"14813","Ted","New York has Greenwich Village.","04","03","I Heart NJ"

"14823","Marshall","I hate New York! Sorry, but it's true. Today, I passed PriceCo. You've already been? It's huge. The New York stores are cramped. When I turn, I spill something. I'm like a big monster out of the ocean to destroy bodegas.","04","03","I Heart NJ"

"15045","Ted","You know what? I take care of the warranty. It makes me happy, because every hole in this apartment is a memory I will never forget. But on one condition  you put all 10 tickets aside every week for next year and come back here and buy this tape 50 years of age, and a toast to the incredible year full of change that we had it. Remove from us. My new family and I, Marshall and Lily, in their apartment and Robin in a number of English-language journalists in the West Pacific, ending up here in New York to celebrate this day...

"15051","Barney","It's amazing.","04","04","Intervention"
"15052","Ted","It's smoky, with hints of cedar and old... You see the difference between that and tape for $ 10?","04","04","Intervention"

"15057","Lily","So if we continued the evening up there?","04","04","Intervention"
"15058","Marshall","Yeah.","04","04","Intervention"
"15059","Ted","Good idea. I have the tape.","04","04","Intervention"
"15060","Barney (old)","What...?","04","04","Intervention"
"15061","Robin","Barney is an intervention.","04","04","Intervention"
"15062","Barney (old)","Sorry, I hear you.","04","04","Intervention"

"15071","Stella (taking the glass of Barney)","I'll just finish this.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15072","Ted","It was just dinner with her sister Stella and her boyfriend.They married before us.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15073","Stella","You know, you dream of the perfect wedding since you been little girl.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15074","Lily","Yeah.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15075","Marshall","Bluntly.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15076","Stella","My sister steals my dream wedding. So every little detail on Shelter Island, the sun managed to sleep...","04","05","Shelter Island"

"15078","Stella (Ted taking the glass)","I'll finish it.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15079","Ted","It seems that the lamb is great here.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15080","Nora","I'm vegan. I wish I could silence that voice in me that says eating animals is murder, but I guess I'm not as strong as you.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15081","Ted","Did you need protein. I take the lamb.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15082","Ted","New objective  Our marriage is to kick the ass of hers.Our marriage is to take the head of his, press it down the toilet and flush 20 times.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15083","Lily","Ted, in high school, his marriage was you, right?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15084","Stella","You know, she always wants to overtake. I like it, but there is a part of me that would like it all falls apart.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15085","Nora","I hate it! I hate him. God, this steak is good. 4 days before and he fled with a consultant from Whole Foods? I do my make-up more for him. I do not shower more for him. I shave armpits more for him.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15086","Ted","Hard to know where is the problem.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15087","Nora","Now, so close to the wedding... Got some bacon or something in the sauce. I love it. I would not be refunded. I will lose thousands of dollars.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15088","Ted (2030)","Children in a relationship, you develop as a telepathy with your partner.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15089","Stella","You think about what? It might help.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15090","Ted","No, Stella, it should help. Pay for dinner. Do not worry.Taking Charge.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15091","Stella","It's true. Recovering your marriage, we reimburse you all that you paid for. Ted and I are getting married Sunday.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15092","Ted","We get married on Sunday? It is sure to be ready for this?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15093","Stella","I've wasted years waiting for the father of Lucy decides to be ""ready"" for it, but it has ever been. That's why we had never married. Come on, must be spontaneous, I dreamed that Tony is spontaneous like that.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15094","Ted","I'm leaving. And I'm also... spontaneous. (He throws a glass of water on his face) I would not have done that.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15095","Ted (2030)","Children, morality often happens at the end of the story, but this one is too important, I will say now  Never, never, invite ex to your wedding. If I was given this advice, it would have changed everything.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15096","Ted","We need you to come, this is my marriage.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15097","Robin","I can not. I am in Tokyo. This is my first week. I can not leave like this. In addition, I am finally serious information.","04","05","Shelter Island"

"15101","Ted","This is my marriage. You gotta be there.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15102","Robin","OK, I'll be there. I gotta go. Good evening. And I'm Robin Scherbatsky. The talks have been arrested in the Middle East. Despite a promising start in the final negotiations, the talks foundered on security.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15103","Ted","It is.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15104","Barney","Okay, burial of bachelorhood. Tonight, I have three exotic dancers most flexible physically and mentally that you've ever seen...","04","05","Shelter Island"

"15110","Barney","No, I recognize a lost cause, when I see it. That's why I'm not recycle. In addition, Ted getting married, it is my interest. You know...","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15111","Barney","I worked on an issue of utmost importance. I admit I was baffled. Until I decided to take the bull by the horns.(Barney written on a board  how to lie down again with Robin) Then, finally, I décryptais code. ""GIVE THE MARRIAGE OF TED. ""","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15112","Lily","So you come back to Robin.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15113","Barney","Let's hope. This weekend is my best chance to start with it.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15114","Lily","You'll never there. Too many opportunities. The first bridesmaid drunk, you'll have your head under the dress as a photographer of yesteryear.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15115","Barney","Lily, kidding. I want to look cutesy and romantic, but this weekend, Robin will be the only girl that I will draw.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15116","Ted (2030)","And the day before the wedding, Stella and I made the trip to Shelter Island. With others not far away.","04","05","Shelter Island"

"15123","Marshall","Super, meals included, right?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15124","Woman","Yes, and they are all 100% vegan.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15125","Barney","I need alcohol. I'm not gonna do that stuff with Robin.Look at that. Berry cocktail, conditioner meninges. I dream, these drinks could make a girl smarter. What hell Ted brought us?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15126","Marshall","There's no meat.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15127","Lily","There's no alcohol.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15128","Marshall","Even worse, I'm 90% sure that this kind in which you spoke was the lead singer of Spin Doctors.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15129","Ted","Guys, Stella and I have a little problem.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15130","Stella","The programs are great. It is not our names on it, but otherwise it looks nice.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15131","Ted","Actually, I spoke to Robin. It is a little late, but it will be there on time.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15132","Stella","You're invited Robin?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15133","Ted","Yes, of course.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15134","Stella","You gave me no warning. I'm not sure what to think.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15135","Ted","Can I help you? Are you happy. You like him.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15136","Stella","Yes, but it's your ex girlfriend. It's weird.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15137","Ted","But no.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15138","Stella","It's weird. Not what you imagine is to see her boyfriend's ex marriage.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15139","Robin","Your new husband dismounted me out three times a day.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15140","Stella","When the former are present, I dunno, it brings back...things unresolved. Close with your ex, do you know that the flame will not turn back?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15141","Ted","Come on, we're friends. In addition, we already had our Thanksgiving last relapse, it is not old.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15142","Stella","Have you bet money against you in this quarrel?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15143","Ted","She already has his ticket.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15144","Stella","It's important to me. I would have never invited the father of Lucy.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15145","Ted","It would not bother me. Tony is great. Invite him too.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15146","Stella","No, Tony is the last person I want to see here, OK? And Robin is the penultimate.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15147","Ted","Robin will soon get on the plane. In addition, it unleashed a lot of work for that.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15148","Robin","Driven by concerns about the environment and oil prices, sales of hybrid vehicles rose 11% over last year.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15149","Ted","What should I do?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15150","Marshall","I know. I understand something is ""no ex"". Why would we want that history failed to come see one successful?It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners World Series. It's embarrassing for everyone.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15151","Barney","What? No. Robin must come.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15152","Ted","That's true, this is my best friend. Girl friend. My best friend girl.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15153","Lily","I do not care, why do such.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15154","Barney","Dude, Robin has to be there.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15155","Marshall","It should not come.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15156","Barney","What are you parl...","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15157","Ted","Aldrin Justice, the last word.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15158","Lily","OK, this would be weird without Robin. But not contradict the bride.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15159","Ted","I will not tell him to come.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15160","Marshall","It's the right decision.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15161","Ted","It's gonna be the worst phone call of all time.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15162","Barney","Co-witness, I'll handle this.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15163","Robin","Hello?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15164","Barney","Robin, where are you?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15165","Robin","I'm off to the airport.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15166","Barney","OK, in a few hours. Have a good flight. Bad news. I can not have it. Robin is gone.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15167","Ted","OK, Robin arrives. You know, I'm fine. The former should be able to go to weddings. I'll tell Stella to do with.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15168","Lily","You should be more delicate with Stella about Robin.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15169","Ted","What do you mean by ""delicate""?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15170","Lily","The brides are very stressed before a wedding. Well, of course, I was under control.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15171","Marshall","Do not you remember?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15172","Lily","The florist told me that roses are medium pink pale pink that means. Medium pink pale! All're done. Our wedding hall uses a boiler instead of a forced air heating. This is the thing that concerned me. Why are we still married?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15173","Marshall","After a while, is that the waffle.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15174","Lily","Poor Stella must be the crazy one month in three days.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15175","Ted","What do I do?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15176","Lily","You wait for the next crisis, the rules you, you're a hero.After, you dealt with on about Robin, but this time she will say yes.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15177","Ted","And if there is no other crises?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15178","Lily","This is a bride. There will be another crisis.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15179","Ted","There is a new crisis.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15180","Lily","Great! What is it?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15181","Stella","My daughter, my daughter does not come to our wedding.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15182","Ted","What?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15183","Stella","Tony was the lead here tomorrow, but cash hurt my marriage, and he will not take him. It's been 5 years. Why not turn the page?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15184","Ted","So, first thing tomorrow I'm going to talk to him, convince him to let me take Lucy, then boom, crisis solved. Stella is happy. Robin comes to marriage.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15185","Nora","You are Barney?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15186","Barney","Yes.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15187","Nora","I heard you were a real b*st*rd, so listen. Tomorrow night, I want to do things so nasty and depraved that I forget that it was supposed to be my wedding.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15188","Barney","I'm here with someone.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15189","Nora","Bring her.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15190","Lily","You'll never get there.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15191","Ted (2030)","So the morning of my wedding, I made the way home Tony, to take Lucy.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15192","Ted","We did a little karate?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15193","Tony","Sorry, sorry dude. You have my alarm activated defense. You must remember these things. Stay alert, rest life.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15194","Ted","OK.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15195","Tony","What brings you here? I thought you'd be in a bridal suite with my wife.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15196","Ted","Not yet. Soon.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15197","Tony","That's right, tonight is the big night. Oh, man, you gonna make love to the mother of my daughter.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15198","Ted","Actually, I've already had s*x many times. Why I always corrects people?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15199","Tony","You and Stella. You're lucky. I could just... I am very happy for you.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15200","Ted","Look, here's the thing...","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15201","Tony","You can not take it.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15202","Ted","Tony, stop. It is also a great day for Lucy. You'll have to put your problems aside and think about what is best for her.Whether you like it or not, it really should be the wedding of his mother. I take Lucy with me.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15203","Tony","You're right, man. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just... You see all... made me realize what I had.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15204","Ted","Let's cuddle.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15205","Tony","I'm sorry. Lucy is everything to me. I will lose it with this family, I am not one.","04","05","Shelter Island"

"15211","Barney","Dear wife, thank you for the interest you have for Barney Stinson...","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15212","Nora","Your back will look like a Jackson Pollock.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15213","Barney","I regret to inform you that at this time...","04","05","Shelter Island"

"15218","Lily","No chance.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15219","Ted","Let me talk to Stella first.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15220","Lucy","Mom! Ted invited Dad!","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15221","Stella","Hi, my heart. You've missed. Just one second, OK?Tony invited you? At our wedding? This was discussed. No ex at our wedding. Why did you do that?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15222","Robin","What did Ted this time?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15223","Stella","What does Robin here? I thought I was clear. No ex at our wedding.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15224","Ted","To be fair... your ex is here.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15225","Stella","You've invited!","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15226","Ted","Come on, it's not weird.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15227","Stella","It's weird. It is as if it was not over between you. Tony and... I can not look after him. Will you tell him to leave? You can say it's my fault. I'll talk to Robin, she knows it's not personal.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15228","Ted (2030)","The children, if I had left Stella talking to Robin, this story would have ended differently.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15229","Robin","I understand.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15230","Tony","I get it.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15231","Man","For the first time, Ted and Stella Mosby.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15232","Ted (2030)","And now, how I met your mother.","04","05","Shelter Island"

"15234","Ted (2030)","But I have not done.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15235","Ted","You can talk to Tony? Robin made the trip from Tokyo. I should talk to him.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15236","Stella","Of course.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15237","Ted","Sorry to have run away like that.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15238","Robin","It's OK. Can you imagine not traveling I did. I was on a plane, a whole day. But it was worth it to see you get married.How I would have missed it...","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15239","Ted","You can not come to the wedding.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15240","Robin","thank you God!","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15241","Ted","What?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15242","Robin","It's weird.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15243","Ted","It's not weird.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15244","Robin","It's weird. You know how it feels to be one of the former married?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15245","Stella","Take that, bitch! I won!","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15246","Ted","It was broken, there is more than a year.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15247","Robin","Yes, but it's not that long ago. See you marry another woman is not really something I look forward to. I just thought if I changed my mind about marriage and children, it was nice knowing you were there.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15248","Ted","So, I was your backup plan. It's flattering.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15249","Robin","That's not it. It's just...","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15250","Ted","Why do you mention that? There was nothing between us.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15251","Robin","Maybe so. I mean, of course it does. The kind of thing that leaves no one fell swoop. I'm not a guest over.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15252","Ted","It's true. We went out together, but... we have moved on.And we got what we wanted. I marry, You have the job of your dreams in Tokyo. And they lived happily...","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15253","Robin","I quit my job.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15254","Ted","You what?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15255","Robin","I return to New York. I thought I wanted this job, but...Getting back to my real life. And you should go back to yours.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15256","Ted","What does that mean?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15257","Robin","You married. Listen, this is precipitated. It's as if you started a book by the end. You are the most romantic. You stole a blue horn for me. You tried to make rain.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15258","Ted","I did the rain.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15259","Robin","It was a coincidence. After all this is how your romantic quest comes to an end? You hide in the wedding of another in his house in his life, without thinking twice. This is not the end spectacular than you deserve. It's not Ted Mosby.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15260","Ted","I love Stella. This is good. If you feel it all... I think it is good that you come to the marriage.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15261","Bartender","Big fight?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15262","Robin","Yes.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15263","Barman","There you go. It is for me.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15264","Robin","You stop it. (Robin drinks the glass of a sudden) My God, so, stop.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15265","Robin","I spend a very bad day. I've stolen scotch at the duty free. It tells you?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15266","Barney","Let's go to your room. Far from it. And can be the whistle.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15267","Robin","I have no room. In fact, I thought I could stay with you.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15268","Barney","No problem. I just need to tidy up a little. Of clothes on the floor and...","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15269","Robin","And a girl naked, tied to your bed.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15270","Barney","The towels in the bathroom, a real mess. So, give me 10 minutes... to restore order...","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15271","Robin","In addition, Barney.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15272","Nora","OK, let's go. Who's that?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15273","Barney","The girl on reception.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15274","Ted (2030)","Children, sometimes you think you live a story, but the truth turns out to be quite different. (Robin is on board a boat, Ted is in his room and read a map and Stella is also on board) In those days, I thought it covered only the presence of Robin marriage. (Stella Tony covers his coat) If only I had understood what it was about.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15275","Stella","Have his former close... it reveals unresolved problems.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15276","Stella","With your ex not far, which tells you that the flame will not turn back?","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15277","Stella","It's as if it was not over between you.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15278","Stella","I've wasted years waiting for the father of Lucy decides to be ""ready"" for it.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15279","Tony","You see all... made me realize what I had.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15280","Stella","I dreamed that Tony is spontaneous like that.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15281","Ted (2030)","Seriously, kids, do not invite your ex to your wedding.","04","05","Shelter Island"
"15282","Ted (2030)","Children, on your wedding day should be the happiest of your life, the culmination of a perfect love story. My marriage, at least the first has not gone so well.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15283","Ted","It's funny when I think about it. I was sure that Stella was good. When she left me, I was so devastated. But you helped me overcome that. Now the hard part is over. I came out a little louder. You know, I do not think further of it. This is the work of time, I guess.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15284","Lily","Ted, the wedding was yesterday. It's been 24 hours.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15285","Ted","I know. That's all I advance. A new chapter in my life begins today, and we'll celebrate. Here, we need two things.We need Kool and the Gang. It's time the jukebox!","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15286","Barney","I watch this young man dancing near the jukebox, and I can not help thinking... Stella may have made the right choice. Ouch!","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15287","Marshall","How can he dance here? He should be trying to smash the car with a club of Stella.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15288","Barney","Assumption. He is not pretending to be happy. Ted is really happy. He did not want to marry from the start. Ted had the best train dodge since Stand by Me Well, not the first kid, but others.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15289","Lily","No, it is a mess.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15290","Ted","It gauze?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15291","Lily","A mess. And one must be there for him.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15292","Ted (2030)","But all my friends wanted to be there for me, I would, seemingly, well.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15293","Lily","Hey, man.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15294","Robin","You wanna hang out?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15295","Ted","Girls, I'm fine.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15296","Marshall","Dude, you make some?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15297","Ted","I'm fine.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15298","Barney","Hey, kid.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15299","Ted","Barney, I'm fine! It is not necessary, and it is rather unhealthy. Sorry, ladies.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15300","Barney","I did not know you'd be here. Girls stairwell.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15301","Ted (2030)","Finally, after two weeks, emotions eventually overflow.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15302","Ted","What do you want for dinner?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15303","Lily","Oh, the farm. I'm sorry, is that you have experienced something traumatic, and we try to be there for you, but do not you leave us, and it irritates us, selfish little whore. Sorry.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15304","Marshall","We are concerned that you faced not what happened with Stella. Do you remember when Lily left me? How I buried my emotions?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15305","Marshall","It... I... miss him so much.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15306","Robin","Yeah man, you've been a rock.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15307","Marshall","I should have been worse, OK? I should have my nerves, follow your advice and burn cases Lily.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15308","Lily","Super. Thank you, Ted.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15309","Marshall","I have not done it, and that's why I took so long to get better. So Ted, I want you explode. Release your rage.Ready? Now!","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15310","Ted","It's OK.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15311","Barney","Guys, let him go. He is happy. Listen, if Ted was married, then he would be married, he would live in New Jersey, and he would be married. It is well. Good, let's eat. Let Flat Michael's?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15312","Ted","It is between the 44th and Lex. Impossible.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15313","Robin","Why?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15314","Ted","It is near the gym Stella. We could cross. Everywhere else, it's going.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15315","Robin","Ok, how about Hurley's?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15316","Ted","Stack between his office and dry cleaner. Sorry.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15317","Lily","Well, The Meatloaf Charlie?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15318","Ted","Two blocks from her mother's hairdresser.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15319","Barney","Okay, Ted, is there a place in Manhattan where one can dine?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15320","Ted","Of course. Look at this.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15321","Robin","It's that thing?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15322","Ted","A reference card I made. A guide to places where you can meet Stella Zinman. The red areas  to avoid. White  OK.Blue  the sea","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15323","Lily","This is ridiculous.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15324","Robin","The sea is blue.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15325","Lily","You can not live like this.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15326","Marshall","It leaves you on the altar, and it's you who're avoiding?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15327","Ted","Yes, I avoid it. What is the problem? It goes like this.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15328","Marshall","It's that ""one"" small dicks?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15329","Ted","No, 'on', it is the people of the great state of Ohio. When life is hard, we take the pain and bury us. And if the pain goes, is buried pain over another. Why cope when you can avoid?All I have to do is to never see her again, and I will have a long happy life. So who wants to eat?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15330","Lily","Someone told me of a tapas bar located in the white zone.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15331","Ted","Super. Let's go.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15332","Waiter","Have you decided?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15333","Ted","Not yet. Can we have almonds to the table?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15334","Waiter","Certainly.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15335","Ted","Well done, Lily. This place looks cool. That you talked about?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15336","Lily","I actually remember it. Oh Oh!","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15337","Robin","What?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15338","Lily","I remember.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15339","Ted","Oh my God! Oh my God! OK, stay cool. We'll just have to manage it. Everyone... follow me.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15340","Marshall","Oh, you laugh.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15341","Lily","He is serious?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15342","Barney","I will not in this table. Possibly, in this one.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15343","Robin","She turns around.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15344","Ted","Think, think. Guys, stay there. I'll take a look. Marshall will look.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15345","Server","Do you want covered?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15346","Stella","No, I'm going home.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15347","Marshall","She took to win.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15348","Ted","She looks happy? She talked about me? I do not care.Where are the almonds?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15349","Barney","Where may well be nuts Ted? You should check the garage in the grip of Stella.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15350","Marshall","Will the yelling.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15351","Lily","You're maybe Ohio, but you live in New York now. We do not bury our emotions in New York. We take our emotions and they are sent to the other side!","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15352","Ted","Let me go. You'd do the same if you were in this situation.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15353","Lily","I dream! There's not one person on Earth to which I would hide under a table.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15354","Ted","Really, not one? Not even... Gazeur?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15355","Lily","How dare you pronounce this name to me?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15356","Robin","Who is Gazeur?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15357","Lily","This is the last person I would like to see here. Michael purifier. This is a guy I was in high school.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15358","Lily","Michael was next to me in Biology. It was a failure for the entire college, but the summer before the third, he grew 30 cm and joined the baseball team. It was becoming a cool guy.Until one day...","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15359","Barney","Lily, you're all been there. When we loose one, it's not pretty.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15360","Robin","You did what?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15361","Lily","Are you kidding? It was the third. I had a choice.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15362","Lily","Oh, my God, purifier! It gauze?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15363","Purifier","It was not me. That was it.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15364","Lily","Of course purifier. Or rather Gazeur. Gazeur!","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15365","Purifier","I'm in the team baseball. I'm cool.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15366","Lily","The Gazeur nickname stuck. He had so much ridicule, he had to change schools.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15367","Barney","The kids are great.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15368","Lily","It made me always feel guilty. But if Gazeur... Michael...came now, as hard as it may be, I would go to Gazeur...Michael... and I should settle things between us.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15369","Robin","Clearing the air, as before. Oh, man. It does not happen often. You are welcome.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15370","Server","It's going guys?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15371","Ted","Let's just eat here, if possible.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15372","Server","This is your almonds.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15373","Ted","Thank you. You have a daily special?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15374","Marshall","Ted, this is ridiculous.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15375","Barney","I am a person who... Well, are facing. There are a bunch of people I do not want to see... as the group of ""girls that I skipped""... but if one of them came here, I would stay there, and I would look into his eyes. For some, this would be the first time.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15376","Ted","Really, you hide from anybody? Not even... Becca Delucci?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15377","Barney","Son of a bitch.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15378","Host","Who is Becca Delucci?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15379","Barney","Do you mind?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15380","Robin","Who is Becca Delucci?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15381","Barney","Becca is this girl who lives in the North. I saw her from time to time.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15382","Ted","Where exactly in the north, Barney?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15383","Barney","Bedford Hills Federal Penitentiary.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15384","Barney","And yes, the visits were of a conjugal nature.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15385","Lily","That's not true?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15386","Barney","Really. And that I had with Becca was a perfect relationship. She was allowed to call me once a week. If it becomes too sticky, the armed guards stoppaient. I've never had to pay for dinner. In fact, this is false. I pay taxes. I guess we all paid for dinner. Thank you, guys. Anyway, at the last visit, I screwed up.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15387","Barney","I know it's hard, baby, but I'm in a prison too.Imprisoned in my heart. This room is ready or what? We can...?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15388","Woman","You're the only thing that kept me here.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15389","Barney","That's why I'm here, baby. I am your strength. I'm...Oh, my God. Hello, stranger. (He hangs up with the first woman prisoner and will talk to another who has just arrived) Barney Stinson, attorney. Let's talk about your output.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15390","Woman","Hell, no!","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15391","Barney","Now I have letters from Becca who say, ""I'll come see you the day I get out of here. I'll hang your eyes in my rearview mirror. ""Women, eh?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15392","Ted","You see? Are you afraid of Becca. Lily is afraid of Gazeur. (Marshall head out from under the table) are still under the table.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15393","Marshall","We do not need. Stella is a party.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15394","Ted","Oh, my God. That's it, and that's it, the style Ohio. The problem manifested itself. It has been avoided. It is a party.Here you can dine in peace...","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15395","Marshall","It comes back. (They go back under the table) We all think that you need... Wait, where is Barney? (Barney is in the next table) We think you should talk to him.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15396","Robin","Not me.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15397","Marshall","What?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15398","Robin","If the last person I wanted to see, came in I would not talk to him.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15399","Ted","Really?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15400","Lily","Who is it?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15401","Robin","My father.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15402","Barney","Boy, this sure is another table. What are we talking?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15403","Lily","From Robin's father.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15404","Robin","I have not spoken to him in 3 years and I want to start now.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15405","Lily","Why?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15406","Robin","It goes back to my birth.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15407","Man","Come on, give me my son. Grows.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15408","Robin","He wanted a son and the fact that I am a girl has not changed.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15409","Ted","How so?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15410","Robin","My full name is Robin Charles Scherbatsky, Jr. And it only got worse.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15411","Robin","At 8, he took me hunting for the first time. I want to shoot a deer.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15412","Father of Robin","Trivia, RJ Shoot a deer is the most noble goals.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15413","Robin","But they're cute.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15414","Father","You said the same about our rabbits. You remember how they were delicious?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15415","Robin","My body started to change...","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15416","Barney","Wait a second. Sorry, continues.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15417","Robin","It was increasingly hard for him to act as if I was a boy.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15418","Robin","The worst moment came in my 14 years. My junior hockey team had just won the ""Squamish Invitational."" And everybody came to my house to celebrate.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15419","Father","Guys, you have behaved splendidly there on the ice.Splendidly. You go outside. I come back with soft drinks and pretzels.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15420","Boy","I can not believe you hast missed the last shot, silly.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15421","Robin","You're an idiot.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15422","Boy","No, it's you, the idiot.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15423","Father","What do you do? You are teammates, hockey players.Teammates do not kiss! Hockey players do not kiss! Oh, my God. I have no son.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15424","Barney","My poor. Being forced to grow up in Canada with America, right next door.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15425","Marshall","It's sad for your father, Robin, but congratulations for this game.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15426","Robin","And Kyle and I are doing anything serious. It was only the blue line.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15427","Barney","The blue line?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15428","Robin","You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that ""crease"" speaks for itself. After that, my relationship with my father has cooled. I moved with my mother, let my hair grow, was a Canadian pop star. Young normal stuff.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15429","Lily","You do not think you'd feel better if you talked to him?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15430","Robin","That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what? ""I wish not to be raised as a boy, that thou teach me not to hunt, fish and smoke cigars and drinking scotch because girls do not do that. And you know why I run like a girl? Because I am one. ""","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15431","Ted","You kept it for quite some time, eh?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15432","Robin","Yes.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15433","Ted","It has returned to you.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15434","Marshall","Sorry.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15435","Barney","It's hot.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15436","Ted (2030)","And I realized... all my friends were haunted, but there was a difference between my and their ghosts. It was not too late for me.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15437","Ted","I'll talk to him. (They go out from under the table, but Stella is gone) She's gone. I'll catch up.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15438","Barney","There, there.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15439","Ted","There she is!","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15440","Ted","I see. It is two taxis right front. Not lose it, OK?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15441","Marshall","Well, well you do. You're going to confront it.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15442","Ted","I will face it.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15443","Robin","This is so exciting.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15444","Ted","Bluntly.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15445","Lily","You're gonna say what?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15446","Ted","I will say, ""Sorry it did not work. ""We will discuss in adults. She'll tell me his views and... I will listen. What I should have done more before.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15447","Barney","You can fly it into the lamp? Fasten your seat belts!Not you, Ted.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15448","Marshall","You have to get angry. Go ahead. Looking good.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15449","Ted","Come on. There is no question of moving his arms, stomping feet and get angry. This is Stella and I finally communicating. Clearly, it was...","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15450","Marshall","Stella hated Star Wars. She lied to you. Seeking your feelings. You know it's true.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15451","Ted","That's his problem.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15452","Barney","Come on, Ted. She left you on the altar.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15453","Robin","I understand!","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15454","Ted","In the name of all that is sacred...","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15455","Lily","Wait, wait! Where it goes? His taxi has missed the exit for the Lincoln Tunnel.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15456","Robin","Why take it away to bring him back in New Jersey, anyway?","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15457","Ted","Maybe she goes to his office.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15458","Marshall","No.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15459","Marshall","The waiter asked him  ""Do you want covered? ""And she said "" I'm going home. ""","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15460","Ted","If she goes to her, why you go to...? Oh, my God. Tony lives in the city center. ""At home"" is Tony's apartment. She would move in with me in New Jersey and moved to town, Tony? The bitch!","04","06","Happily Ever After"

"15476","Ted","I know exactly what I say. (Ted comes out of the taxi) You chose the wrong guy. You chose the wrong guy. You did a very, very, very bad choice. What were you thinking? This guy? You kidding me? Have you learned anything these past 8 years? You'll be sorry. You know it? You'll be sorry, and you can do anything about it because it is too late.

"15486","Ted (2030)","Here we go at once. And it was over. At this point, I was not angry. I saw that she was made to be with him.Children, you might think that the only choices are to swallow his anger, or swing at someone. There is another option  you can let it flow, and when you do that, we can forget and move forward. And that was the perfect ending to a perfect love story.It was just not mine. Mine was always there, waiting for me.","04","06","Happily Ever After"
"15487","Barney","I'm not impressed by the talent here tonight. And more I drink, the less it is attractive. I'm a whiskey and Coke in the Cantina scene in Star Wars.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15488","Ted","And those girls over there? They are cannon.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15489","Barney","Absolutely not.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"

"15492","Lily","A max.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15493","Marshall","Barney, they are canon.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15494","Barney","There is so much to learn. You are only victims of...the effect cheerleaders. Good question. The effect cheerleading is when a group of women air cannon, but only in groups. As with the cheerleaders. They look like cannon, but take them individually? Cod.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15495","Ted","Anything.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"

"15502","Ted","You're gonna be a father? How will it happen?","04","07","Not a Father's Day"

"15504","Lily","That may be a false alarm. It is perhaps not pregnant.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15505","Barney","No part of Barney Stinson does not run at less than 110%. If one of my Michael Phelps escaped, he swims for gold. It's a nightmare. I want no children. How can want to have children without being mad?","04","07","Not a Father's Day"

"15514","Marshall","No matter, it will be so cute, I'm going to exhaust the first day.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15515","Lily","And for the money? It has a ton of debt.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"

"15657","Robin","No. I do not know what she's doing there. It must have fallen into it. Bizarre!","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15658","Ted","""Falling in? ""","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15659","Robin","Or Lily put it there for fun. That bitch is stuffed. I took it.It's just... so cute. Sock.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15660","Ted","Robin Scherbatsky, you get the idea of having children?","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15661","Robin","I know. One day, perhaps. When I'm 70. Science will catch me. I'm just... I'm lost right now. I'm unemployed, I live on a couch.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15662","Ted","There were two difficult months both. I have a room free.Why not come to me in the meantime?","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15663","Robin","Really?","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15664","Ted","Yeah.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15665","Robin","Thank you, Ted. I have some ideas, so it will be one week, two large max.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15666","Ted (2030)","And this is how your aunt Robin moved in with me.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15667","Lily","I'm bored. Come and dance. Come fly a liquor store!","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15668","Marshall","We're going nowhere. Each time we go out when you're drunk, you always fall asleep when you enter the...","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15669","Lily","Let's dance! We gonna party all night!","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15670","Marshall","Can you make several turns to make sure she is asleep?","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15671","Driver","Sure.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15672","Barney","The last great idea for Fathers Day-No, a pregnancy test, but instead of a blue line, there is a small blue Barney who does that.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15673","Ted","Day of Non-Fathers, it sucks. It's a feast for the losers.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15674","Barney","What are you talking? This is a good group of friends.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15675","Ted","This is the effect cheerleaders.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15676","Barney","No, Ted. It works for girls.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15677","Robin","Look at these guys, individually. These geniuses are not childless by choice, my friend.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"

"15682","Lily","No, you feel ""pancake, I'm sorry for being such a stupid drunk"" chocolate.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15683","Marshall","There's no ""I wish not to throw up on you"" bacon?","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15684","Lily","Of course.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15685","Marshall","Baby...","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15686","Lily","I blame myself for last night. I was really painful. I just panicked at the thought of whether we are ready to parent. But you are so well taken care of me. I know you're gonna be a good father.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15687","Marshall","I want to be a father now.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15688","Lily","What?","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15689","Marshall","Last night, it was just... I share between work and drunk baby Lily, it was too. I just begin with this job, I work long hours... I love you. And I really want to have children one day.I just want... I want to be ready for that.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15690","Lily","Me too. When we're ready, I know you'll be fantastic.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15691","Marshall","You too.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15692","Lily","You wanna make love, by protecting themselves now?","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15693","Marshall","Yes.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15694","Lily","You want to finish your bacon first?","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15695","Marshall","You're the perfect woman.","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15696","Barney","""And the cat is in the cradle and the silver spoon Little Boy Blue and the Man on the Moon. When are you going back home, Dad? I do not know when we're together then, son I know we will have a good time. ""","04","07","Not a Father's Day"
"15697","Ted (2030)","Children at the end of 2008, your Aunt Robin was unemployed and a little adrift, so his friendship with Lily was more important than ever.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15698","Robin","So, it seems that Marshall has to work late on Friday.You know what that means, party girls.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15699","Lily","Well, a teacher at my school, Jillian, a birthday. What?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15700","Robin","It's just that... I have never heard of this before Jillian, and suddenly, it's your best friend. You do not stop talking about her.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15701","Lily","Do not be jealous. We hang out together all the time.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15702","Robin","Yeah, but Marshall is still there. There was not much time to talk, just us two.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15703","Lily","This is false.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15704","Robin","This is where the story gets really good. So it goes...","04","08","Woooo!"
"15705","Marshall","Hi.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15706","Robin","... place. And then this... guy talking about this thing with the stuff of which I spoke the other day about this place.Well, anyway... it happened.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15707","Marshall","My God. You and the guy the mayor's office did it to the UN under the office of Ambassador of Zaire? Cool.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15708","Robin","I wish we had time for girls. I love Marshall, but I am not free to express myself.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15709","Lily","Come with me and Jillian, then.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15710","Robin","OK, but I want to stay too late because... (Marshall and Ted joined them at the table) Do you remember... this thing last month after going there? You know who said it was going, but she gave me tips.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15711","Marshall","You always mycoses?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15712","Barney","I want to take this moment.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15713","Marshall","Which one?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15714","Barney","The last time you and I are just competing for the title of best friend Ted.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15715","Ted","Marshall is my best friend.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15716","Barney","Exactly. Draw. But it's all about to change. Is it correct that you are an architect?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15717","Ted","My best friend does not, but still.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15718","Barney","You draw what now?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15719","Ted","Well, you renovate the library Nouillorc.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15720","Robin","That's great!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15721","Ted","No, not the New York Public Library. This is the library Nouillorc, in Dakota. Their books are in two parts  fishing and not fishing.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15722","Barney","I think you'll love what's happened at work.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15723","Bilson","While corruption has destabilized the regime and killed most of the royal family, it helped to relax banking regulation in Rangoon. Good for us. Last order of the meeting it was decided to continue on the project's new headquarters in the city of Goliath National Bank.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15724","Ted","Who's going to draw?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15725","Barney","That was my first question.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15726","Barney","Who's going to draw?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15727","Bilson","We approached a company. This Swedish architectural collective called Sven.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15728","Ted","Sven?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15729","Ted (2030)","Sven was this swedish architecture collective revered for their bold, innovative designs. I hated them.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15730","Ted","I hate them. Swedish architecture collective.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15731","Robin","No one.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15732","Lily","Pretentious.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15733","Ted","""It is not a company. It is a collective. ""","04","08","Woooo!"
"15734","Barney","I know. ""We're Swedish. It's so cool with our baguettes and our Eiffel Tower. ""","04","08","Woooo!"
"15735","Marshall","Sweden, this is not France. You know that?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15736","Barney","It's France. No matter, I told Bilson...","04","08","Woooo!"
"15737","Barney","Bislon, saving your...","04","08","Woooo!"
"15738","Barney","No, I get up, and I told Bilson...","04","08","Woooo!"
"15739","Barney","Bislon, saving your...","04","08","Woooo!"
"15740","Barney","Music. Imagine a patriotic music.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15741","Barney","Bilson, with all due respect... it would be terrible if a job that would suit American architects was relevant to a band of French. Where is our patriotism? Love of country? Our love of all that...","04","08","Woooo!"
"15742","Bilson","Listen, Stinson, no one hates all the other countries of the world than me, but you have arguments?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15743","Barney","Yes. I know a great American architect who would be perfect. Ted Mosby.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15744","Barney","All you have to do is come and offer your drawing, I take care of the Board, the project is yours.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15745","Ted","You realize what a hero I'd be if I brought this project to my box?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15746","Barney","It's not the best. We three, we'll work together.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15747","Marshall","Ted will come to call.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15748","Barney","Yes, totally.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15749","Ted","What is it?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15750","Barney","It works like this  one of us goes into the office the other and said...","04","08","Woooo!"
"15751","Barney","Marshall, the teleconference begins soon.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15752","Marshall","Sorry, I gotta go.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15753","Barney","And then you go up on the roof... and drink beer.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15754","Marshall","It's great. Drinking at work.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15755","Barney","Basically, it is of ""Mad Men.""","04","08","Woooo!"
"15756","Marshall","Yes! There is too much ""Mad Men""!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15757","Barney","I'll spank a secretary.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15758","Marshall","That's exactly what they would do in this series.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15759","Barney","What series?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15760","Barney","And then you throw the bodies of cans at pigeons.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15761","Marshall","I do not do that.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15762","Ted","I love to do that.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15763","Barney","I will realize your dream.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15764","Ted","Seriously, Barney, from what I've lived with Stella, I have this opportunity... it touches me.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15765","Ted (2030)","It was true. You see, children, when I became an architect, I had a dream... contribute to building a panorama of New York. I wanted to point one of these buildings and say, ""See that? That right there? This is mine. ""This job was the opportunity to realize that.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15766","Robin","Your friend has a birthday here? She has what, 19?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15767","Lily","No. Believe me, it's not his style. She must not know what kind of place this is.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15768","Jillian","We're here, my little p *** sexy! We just get served!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15769","All","Wooo!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15770","Lily","Oh, my God. At school, she is so calm and normal. I thought it was not... a Woo.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15771","Ted (2030)","What is Woo? Let me explain. Woo is a kind of a young woman, who, like the cuckoo and the nightingale, takes its name from its singular it produces. Also, a Woo can be triggered in different ways. On one particular song on the jukebox...","04","08","Woooo!"
"15772","Jillian","My God, this song is my story too.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15773","All","Wooo!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15774","Ted (2030)","... to a cheap shooter. On a ride on a mechanical bull... up, everything and anything.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15775","Jillian","Oh my God, I was afraid of not having fed the cat, then I remembered that I had done.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15776","All","Wooo!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15777","Lily","I swear, at school, Jillian is not so Woo.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15778","Robin","It was not like a Woo. Perhaps it is that holidays like Mardi Gras and the day of the year. Maybe this is a cyclical Woo.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15779","Ted","Okay, be cool with me. This is a first draft.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15780","Barney","Ted, it's incredible. Detail. Shadows. The liveliness of the lines. This is exactly what Princess Leia would look like, topless.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15781","Ted","My way of saying thank you. Okay, you wanna see my designs for the building?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15782","Barney","No, that's fine.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15783","Marshall","Listen to this. Lily sent me a text message. It was at this bar, The Giddy Ups with full of Woos.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15784","Jillian","My God, girls, my breast just out of my top bar. And no! I took it out for a drink blackjack!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15785","All","Wooo!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15786","Robin","So, Jillian, it seems that when you not flash the bartenders, you are mistress of CE1. How is it?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15787","Jillian","If rewarding. I dunno if you know the RIE method, but it derives from the philosophy of progressive education Steiner founded the Waldorf school, which is... Oh my God, I love this song! Come on bitches, let's dance!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15788","All","Wooo!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15789","Jillian","You too, my ****** s.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15790","Lily","No thank you... drag ignorant.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15791","Barney","Lily Aldrin, little secretive. For years, I say that our gang needs a Woo, and thou hast hid me in a whole herd.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15792","Lily","You do not need a Woo. Nobody needs it.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15793","Barney","Attention Lily. The world badly needs the Woos. If there were not Woos, there would not Girls Gone Wild, no bachelor party girl, no pool bar in Las Vegas... all the things you hold dear would not exist.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15794","Lily","None of this stuff...","04","08","Woooo!"
"15795","Barney","Industry shooters memories would collapse. Just like the glitter body and that of Hummer limos. The mini cowboy hats would be worn by the little cowboys. And when ""Brown Eyed Girl"" happen on a jukebox, you do not hear... that silence. And ""Brown Eyed Girl."" But who would Woo, Lily?Who would woo? Would you? You'd... Woo?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15796","Jillian","Who wants to name my tits?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15797","All","Wooo!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15798","Barney","Well you'll excuse me, I have a date with Bataille and Fontaine.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15799","Ted (2030)","The weeks that followed, I immersed myself in work. It was great to be on a project I really wanted to heart.Finally, the morning of the presentation arrived.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15800","Ted","And we think this design will radiate timeless power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15801","Ted (2030)","I came out pretty confident about my chances.That evening I met Barney.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15802","Ted","Hey, Barney! Give me the good news.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15803","Barney","You did not have.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15804","Ted","What?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15805","Barney","The Board... Sven decided to choose.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15806","Woman (in a limo)","Wooo!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15807","Ted","I can not believe I had not. I thought I had hit the nail. Why did they choose Sven?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15808","Barney","I've done everything to change their minds. But they did not budge. I'm sorry.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15809","Ted","It's really bad. After the way the last few months have passed... I guess I'd need more than I thought.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15810","Marshall","You want to go to the current GNB building and just... I dunno, just a little pee on it?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15811","Ted","I think I need it.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15812","Barney","Finish Your Beer. Fill the machine.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15813","Robin","It's been what?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15814","Lily","Ted did not get the job. But this is not the biggest disappointment of the day.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15815","Robin","What?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15816","Lily","You were seen to Woo.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15817","Robin","Given that, do Woo?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15818","Lily","You who did Woo?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15819","Robin","I have not done Woo.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15820","Lily","Oh, yes.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15821","Robin","That's not true.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15822","Lily","Your nose is growing. You've become best friends with Jillian now?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15823","Robin","It's just... You're married, I'm still single. Whenever I'm with you, I'm usually the 3rd wheel. Sometimes it's nice to go out with other singles and doing stuff you do not.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15824","Lily","Like what?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15825","Robin","As to Woo, Lily. As to Woo.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15826","Lily","I can Woo.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15827","Robin","That's not true.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15828","Lily","But if.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15829","Robin","It's not you, that.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15830","Marshall","Bilson? I just wanna say, I know that you chose Sven, but... Ted Mosby is extremely talented, and... he would have made a hell of a job.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15831","Bilson","Yes. I voted for him.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15832","Barney","It's okay. All withdrawals at ATMs are free.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15833","Marshall","Teleconference. Now.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15834","Marshall","You wanna tell me something?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15835","Barney","Good grief. I told Heather to put everything back as it was on your desk.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15836","Marshall","Bilson told me he wanted to give the job to Ted.What has happened?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15837","Barney","Okay.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15838","Ted","... will radiate power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15839","Barney","So?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15840","Bilson","It was great. I like it.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15841","Barney","It looks like we had our man. I not think there need to see...","04","08","Woooo!"
"15842","Man","I'm Sven Jorgensen. With me, there's Pilsen and Sven Sven Johanssen, and it is... Sven! You are the Goliath National Bank. You are at the forefront. You are new and fresh.Women want to be with you, men want to hurt you, but the fool who dares challenge you will be crushed! Your home office will show the world these facts. And one more thing... Do not look now! (It shows a dinosaur) Who is Barney Stinson, the head of the Research Committee?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15843","Barney","Oh, my God. It's me!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15844","Sven","You, Barney Stinson, are a man of power and virility.Your office will be here in the head of Tyrannosaurus.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15845","Barney","I've never known so far, but I've always wanted.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15846","Sven","On your desktop rosewood Honduras, there is this button.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15847","Barney","What does this button?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15848","Sven","Press! Press for the glory!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15849","Barney","It's building the coolest of the universe. It could not be more awesome.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15850","Sven","There is a striptease club in the letter ""N"".","04","08","Woooo!"
"15851","Marshall","What is your problem? This is the big break of Ted!You have betrayed to work in the brain of a Tyrannosaurus, which, incidentally, if you knew the dinosaurs is very, very small.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15852","Barney","It's not my office. The building was well Ted. That of Sven was better. And I will not let the fact that I am the best friend of Ted influence business.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15853","Marshall","You have not chosen one of Sven because he was better. You wanted an office dinosaur.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15854","Barney","It's a lie! I chose it because it... He breathes fire, Marshall.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15855","Marshall","""Fire Marshall"".","04","08","Woooo!"
"15856","Barney","I have not even paid attention.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15857","Marshall","How could you do that to Ted after all that happened with Stella? You are an egoist.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15858","Barney","I never made a career choice by selfishness. I am a professional. Go. Spend a good day, drunk, and throw the bodies of the pigeons.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15859","Marshall","No. For two reasons. A, pigeons are smarter than you think. They are resentful. And two, it's our last conference call, Mr. Stinson. There are repercussions to ride a friend.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15860","Barney","Like what?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15861","Marshall","Because, that.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15862","Jillian","My God, girls. Yesterday, we collected $ 10 000 for my charity that fights illiteracy children. It's a real problem.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15863","Robin","Someone won a trip buttocks until the first dance floor of the canyon of spanking!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15864","All","Wooo!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15865","Lily","Wooo!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15866","Robin","What are you doing here?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15867","Lily","The same things are funny as singles.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15868","Robin","That's what the fireman's helmet?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15869","Lily","I had no cowboy hat, and it was the day of fire safety at school... My God, ***** s. This is our theme.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15870","Robin","Really? Who sings that?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15871","Lily","LL Cool J stuff always comes out?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15872","Barney","That's great, Sven. You are so much cooler than Marshall. He has not even mix. Who wants a foam?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15873","Sven","I do not understand. Where is the call?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15874","Barney","It's the call. Got it? In America, when we work late, you lie on a conference call, and here we ascend a few beers. It's great.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15875","Sven","It's a waste of time. Pumps!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15876","Jillian","Misty, you're a real slut. We get another shot.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15877","All","Wooo!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15878","Misty","It's you, the slut, drag. It is you who pays.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15879","All","Wooo!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15880","Woman","No, ***** s, it is you who pays. You're too p *** a.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15881","All","Wooo!","04","08","Woooo!"
"15882","Lily","You are a bunch of prostitutes. You must have STDs.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15883","Jillian","Come and dance.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15884","Robin","Lily, it does not work. You should not be there.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15885","Lily","I get it. Because I am happily married, I'm a schmuck?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15886","Robin","On the contrary. Why do you think the Woo Woos have to when they win a drinking game? Or when a guy takes off his gun t-shirt? Because that's all that life brings. These are...People really sad. And when she go out with someone who has it all, someone like you, it's disappointing. It takes them Woo.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15887","Lily","You say that to make me feel not like an old married.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15888","Robin","Look at those girls. Look at them and listen to what they mean Woo.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15889","Woman","Wooo! (""I cry in the shower!"")","04","08","Woooo!"
"15890","Misty","Wooo! (""I've never had a second date!"")","04","08","Woooo!"
"15891","Jillian","Wooo! (""And if I was ever mother?"")","04","08","Woooo!"
"15892","Woman 2","Wooo! (""I'm secretly in love with Jillian!"")","04","08","Woooo!"
"15893","Ted","Wooo! (""My career and my love life going nowhere!"")","04","08","Woooo!"
"15894","Lily","The poor girls... and Ted. I want to give them a hug.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15895","Robin","Right now I am like them. I have no job, no boyfriend, I'm confused. So... occasionally, I need to Woo, but when I need to talk about something concrete, it is to you I turn. You're my best friend.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15896","Lily","And you, mine. And I promise to dedicate ourselves more time. Marshall did not need to paste something from being done.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15897","Marshall","You have tested those purple shots in test tubes? I took five. I believe that there is no alcohol in it.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15898","Lily","Where did you get that hat?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15899","Marshall","What hat?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15900","Barney","It turned Sven.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15901","Ted","What?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15902","Barney","Those guys were morons. Of course, they had cool ideas... really cool ideas. In fact, I wonder if it's not too late...The fact is  you have the job.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15903","Ted","Really?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15904","Barney","The committee realized he had erred. In addition, you are precious to them and they want you to be happy.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15905","Ted","It's weird.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15906","Barney","Your plans were the best and you deserve it. You should know one thing that you did not get the job early. You see, Ted...","04","08","Woooo!"
"15907","Marshall","It was Bilson. Bilson wanted to have a head office in the dinosaur, Barney convinced him that it was really, really stupid.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15908","Barney","You know...","04","08","Woooo!"
"15909","Ted","Thank you, Barney. I believe it. I brought in my box the largest contract that she had. Wooo! (""Now, only my love life is a disaster!"") The next is for me.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15910","Barney","Why you helped me?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15911","Marshall","You did the right thing. You got a well deserved boost. And then it would have disappointed Ted, and it is finally... very happy for the moment.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15912","Barney","You are truly the best friend Ted. And me too. Tie.Thank you, Marshall.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15913","Ted (2030)","Marshall eventually cracked and confessed the truth about Barney, like, ten minutes later, so much so that Uncle Barney attached to a mechanical bull, set to position ""Mixed Paint"" and it returned.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15914","Ted","I love you, man.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15915","Barney","Me too, buddy.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15916","Ted","You mount the bull?","04","08","Woooo!"
"15917","Barney","No, even if you pay me. I have an inner ear problem.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15918","Ted (2030)","It was a rather brilliant night.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15919","Man","three hours. This is the record of the bar.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15920","Barney","That's right, girls.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15921","Woman","You know what would be really crazy, funny and stupid to do tonight? If you and I, we found a guy to do it for three.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15922","Jillian","Maybe... If we find the right guy.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15923","Woman","Yes, and... if there is not the right guy, both could just...","04","08","Woooo!"
"15924","Jillian","You know who is more cute? This guy, Ted. Come and get it.","04","08","Woooo!"
"15925","Ted (2030)","Children, it is believed all know how long it takes to recover from a breakup.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15926","Lily","Half the time the relationship.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15927","Marshall","One week per month spent together.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15928","Robin","Just 10,000 glasses. No matter how long it takes.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15929","Barney","You can not measure something like that in a while. It is step by step. From his bed at the front door. Bam! You're outside. Next!","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15930","Ted (2030)","But you're beginning to recover when you meet the person who puts you in the game. This is the story of how I met this person. (Ted takes the elevator with a woman. She goes out and Ted is in the elevator) Children, if you go swimming, you immerse them directly. (Another, he finds himself again in the elevator with the woman) First, you dip your toe in the water.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15931","Ted","Hi.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15932","Woman","Hi.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15933","Ted (2030)","You take the temperature, to get an impression.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15934","Ted","For me it's Ted.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15935","Ted (2030)","And you come back gently into the water.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15936","Ted","I was left on the altar, there is one month.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15937","Ted (2030)","Or, you know, the bomb.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15938","Ted","It was a complete disaster and since then I have not even managed to look at another woman. Except the old lady in the subway that makes break dancing. I look at it that way. I just watched. Finally, it is an old lady who made the break dance.And it is good. I will give him a dollar, the next time. Let's pretend I said it  These travel lift were asleep the moment of my week, and I would like to see you Friday night. In a lift. At the restaurant, nice. What do you think?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15939","Vicky","Yes.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15940","Ted (2030)","Children, I saw a bunch of crazy stuff on entering the apartment all these years.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15941","Lily","Sorry guys. I'll just make a fruit cup.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15942","Marshall","It's been 12 minutes!","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15943","Robin","Put it!","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15944","Man 1","You first!","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15945","Man 2","Why you referred me, Ike?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15946","Ike","Do not say my name!","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15947","Robin","Ask your weapons!","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15948","Ted (2030)","But one of the craziest things I saw happened when I was a roommate with your Aunt Robin.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15949","Ted","You're who?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15950","Ted","What are you doing, Mitch?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15951","Mitch","You must be the roommate. I'm with Robin. She came out to take a call. I think its handheld gaming here.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15952","Ted","Robin did not use the super secret signal. We put the old menu on the handle. This restaurant had to close. Mr. Popol...No need to explain why it's funny. I'm off. When leaving, take the pillow with you. This is a waste now.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15953","Robin","I think I am more than qualified for the job. My weaknesses? I would say too caring, overworked, and I spend my career first. Oops! The latter is true. What?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15954","Ted","Apparently, our sweet, innocent, little Robin led a lover. A young skinny named Mitch.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15955","Lily","His thing arranged? A real disaster. She sent me text messages all night. She just let go to use the bathroom.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15956","Ted","Excuse me one minute.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15957","Mitch","Man, you annoy me. I am in action here.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15958","Ted","What action?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15959","Mitch","This is my technique. It's called, ""The guy with hair.""","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15960","Ted","""The guy naked?""","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15961","Mitch","That's the trick. You're the first date, you've had a few drinks, you go out an excuse to go to the girl.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15962","Robin","The bathroom is. (His phone rings) You know what, I will respond.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15963","Mitch","Then when she leaves, you undress and wait for you.When she returns, she laughs. She is so fascinated by your insurance, and your bravado she sleep with you.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15964","Ted","No chance it works!","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15965","Mitch","Two out of three.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15966","Ted","Two out of three?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15967","Mitch","Two out of three. You just choose your moment. ""The guy naked"" mostly run as a last resort, the last resort to first appointment when you know that there will be no second.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15968","Ted","How do you know?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15969","Mitch","Look at me.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15970","Ted","I'd rather not.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15971","Mitch","Robin is not in my division. I'm not smart, funny and handsome. As you can see, there is nothing impressive nowhere there. My only chance with a girl like Robin, is the surprise. And let's be honest, a little pity. This is shock and ""Ohhh.""","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15972","Ted","It does not work really.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15973","Mitch","Two out of three. Guaranteed.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15974","Marshall","No December '.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15975","Ted","Two out of three. He assured me.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15976","Barney","Seriously. No chance it works on Robin. It will come, take a look at this idiot and send tampers.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15977","Lily","She'll beat him up, yes.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15978","Marshall","It's going to take his gun and shoot him.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15979","Marshall","My God!","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15980","Ted","It worked.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15981","Marshall","The business returns for Mr. Popol.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15982","Barney","""The naked guy"" works! It will revolutionize the blows of an evening! It's like the forward pass in American football.Dunk the basketball. This stuff barber where they hold the wick and cut above. It changes everything!","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15983","Lily","Barney, this guy has slept with Robin, you say that being in love. How it makes you excited?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15984","Barney","""The naked guy"" is more important than me and Robin. All these years, I broke my ass, with my secret identity, my laps and my gadgets. I mean, I'm Batman. But this guy is Superman. He tears his clothes and go.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15985","Lily","What kind of gadgets you talking about?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15986","Ted","So, it's going to be, a roommate? I come home, and guys with whom you will go out sitting on the couch, naked.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15987","Robin","I can not tell you.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15988","Ted","I can not believe that ""The guy with hair 'market has on you.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15989","Robin","How do you say? I entered and he was naked. It was funny. I laughed, he laughed. And then it happened. I know not.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15990","Marshall","I say ***** s!","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15991","Robin","Sorry?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15992","Marshall","Sorry Robin, but cate with this type suggests that all that separates you from s*x, it's the clothes.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15993","Robin","I have not slept with Mitch because he was naked.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15994","Marshall","So, why did you lie?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15995","Robin","Because... It... It... because I like Mitch. Much. There was a... connection specificity. Specificity and feelings.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15996","Marshall","Because he was naked. Sorry, but I disagree. There is only one reason to sleep with someone, and it is ""love"".Marshall is a big girl because he believes in love and read ""And it was true"" because the secretaries were forced to join the Oprah book club. But you know I'm right.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15997","Lily","Marshall, I love you, but there are plenty of reasons to lie.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15998","Marshall","Cite me one.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"15999","Lily","I will quote 50.","04","09","The Naked Man"

"16003","Marshall","I'm here.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16004","Marshall","You have defiled the marital bed because you could not sleep?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16005","Lily","It was you who said, ""This shadow on the ceiling, it looks an awful clown toothless. Good night, Lily. ""","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16006","Marshall","Okay! It makes one. But I dare you to...","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16007","Lily","I'll give you 50. There's s*x reconciliation... breaking s*x, and s*x ""a friend told you about a new position.""","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16008","Barney","You're welcome. There is also ""revenge"", ""bounce back"", ""parachuting"". When you're traveling, but instead of going to the hotel, you'll live in a bar to find a girl to get a foothold.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16009","Robin","Oh, that, ""the kiss for a roof.""","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16010","Marshall","***** S!","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16011","Robin","I do not. My roommate in college did.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16012","Marshall","No, Robin, it's just a bad cough. I'm not really a bad cough. We all know that the ""roommate in college,"" it's you, ***** s! Nobody has a Strepsil?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16013","Lily","Oh, I have one. s*x ""bugger all on TV.""","04","09","The Naked Man"

"16016","Robin","s*x, ""He says he loves you, but do not want to say the same.""","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16017","Lily","43.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16018","Ted","""The co-pilot who jumps on the grenade to a friend.""","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16019","Lily","44.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16020","Barney","""Condoms will expire.""","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16021","Lily","45. It gets a little tough.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16022","Barney","46!","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16023","Lily","Still 4. ""You make a crisp fall on his knees and the when you picked up, he thinks it is an approach, and it happens.""","04","09","The Naked Man"

"16025","Lily","You gave me some chips.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16026","Marshall","You can stop with this stupid list? You make me sad.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16027","Lily","No, I have fun. But this thing of a ""partner"", it sucks sometimes. I always talk about you. I can not play ""I never,"" because everyone knows all the quirks that I let you do.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16028","Marshall","The only oddity that I did was to open my heart and my soul when I had put me to hair when the room was empty.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16029","Robin","I have not slept with Mitch because he was naked!Mitch and I have something special. My fingers are crossed.That may be correct.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16030","Marshall","The good? Mitch? The guy naked?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16031","Barney","You mean the naked genius. All this time I wore a suit when I should have removed it. That's it. I ""The guy naked,"" tonight. And you too.","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16032","Ted","What?","04","09","The Naked Man"
"16033","Barney","With the girl from the elevator. You're with her tonight?""Dude naked""!","04","09","The Naked Man"

"16061","Ted","When I realized that there was no future in this relationship, I decided to do.","04","09","The Naked Man"

"16481","Marshall","I said, good evening everyone!","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16482","Robin","And when we missed the penalty and lost...","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16483","All","Holy sh1t!","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16484","Robin","Holy sh1t! f*cking. My father that I had never seen him cry in my life, wiped away a tear and said, ""A small part of me just died, son. ""","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16485","Man","""Son""?","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16486","Robin","That's what I tell my son. If I am fortunate to have a son, I will call Rashad Tarkenton.","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16487","Man","Nice story.","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16488","Marshall","Beautiful story! But it seems a bit familiar.","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16489","Robin","I know! They all bought into.","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16490","Marshall","I see what you do.","04","11","Little Minnesota"

"16492","Marshall","I've brought here because... I was sorry for you. And there, it looks like you're trying to steal my bar.","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16493","Robin","You think I'm trying to steal your bar? Host.","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16494","Man","""Host""? Are you Canadian?","04","11","Little Minnesota"

"16496","Man","If you want to imitate a Canadian, just turn off the light and act as if you were afraid!","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16497","Robin","What was that?","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16498","Marshall","With the nearby Canada, Minnesota, we like to make jokes on your back and they are often on the same theme.","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16499","Robin","As fear of the dark?","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16500","Marshall","Yes. For example, everyone, how many Canadians does it take to change a lightbulb? ""What? No, the bulb is dead? I'm afraid! ""","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16501","Robin","This is stupid. Why do you think Canadians are afraid of the dark?","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16502","Marshall","Where do prejudices? A stereotype appears, and suddenly, it spreads like fire. Asians misbehave, the Scots are stingy, the Brazilians are too many stamps. I doubt it works.You can not hang out with people who belittle your beloved country. I take you back.","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16503","Robin","No, wait. I have something to say. Everyone. Let me tell you something about Canadians.","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16504","Marshall","Please, no scene.","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16505","Robin","Why Canadians are not of birthday wishes? Because they are too afraid to put out the candles. My God, I love this place!","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16506","Barney","I think your prospects are good for GNB. U you have shown me that you can take any position.","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16507","Lily","This is the new coasters?","04","11","Little Minnesota"

"16509","Lily","I swear, these coasters are thicker.","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16510","Heather","I'm ready to bend over backwards.","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16511","Ted","OK, enough! I can not believe you hast slept with my sister!","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16512","Barney","You've sneaked?","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16513","Lily","You know what? It's a new batch of old coasters. I will confirm with the bartender.","04","11","Little Minnesota"
"16514","Ted (holding Lily)","And you, you're mature and responsible?It's responsible adult to go to your first interview in New York and banging a stranger?

"16969","Marshall","You know what will happen?","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16970","Robin","You know what you are? You're a snob of love. There's lots of ways to live a relationship, you would know if you left your little club ""Snob love.""","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16971","Marshall","We'll be buried under the snow, that's what will happen.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16972","Robin","Nothing to be done. I will not sit here and insult me.We're not going to the airport. We go. (The snowplow passes and buried under the snow) It's been what?","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16973","Lily","It was earlier called for the drink of Seattle.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16974","Man","You did well to call. I was close. It's the perfect storm outside. It was only in 2009, when the storm of the century, it is perhaps a little premature. Let the storm of the year. Even if one is in January.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16975","Lily","It is rather a hurry, so we'll take the beer.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16976","Man","You are a cute couple.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16977","Ranjit","Thank you.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"

"16982","Lily","You take the barrel.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"

"16984","Lily","Sorry, Ranjit, but it is a ritual, and I back this beer. If you could put it in the car. I'll give you $ 50.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16985","Ranjit","A car.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16986","Marshall","Robin, I'm sorry. You're not a robot. If you are, you are a very advanced model, and the human race has no chance. You did not choose to show your love through rituals tacky, and that's good. But maybe we did that because we have always done and we know no other way. What I know is that if there sitting alone at the airport, I have to go get her.These are the rules.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16987","Robin","Close your eyes.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16988","Marshall","I know not how you thought I draguais you, but...","04","13","Three Days of Snow"

"16990","Barney","Okay, go. You are not obliged to return, but you can not stay. I always wanted to say that. I mean, in a bar. I say all the time with me.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16991","Man","One day, we should have a bar. And when it will, there will never be nightcap.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"

"16994","Ted","We can do one thing.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16995","Ted","Caring for a bar, it's boring. We should stick to what we know.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16996","Barney","We should start a band.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16997","Ted","Of course! Why was not yet formed a band?","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"16998","Ted (2030)","Children, sometimes in life, the planets align, everything comes together, and your timing is perfect.(Marshall and Lily calls Marshall called Lily but neither Marshall or Lily of the horizon.

"17005","Ted (2030)","As I said, it was a storm of three days. Tuesday...","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17006","Robin","I still think it's stupid.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17007","Ted (2030)","Wednesday... (Barney and Ted are at McClaren's, behind the counter) And Thursday... (Lily is a store with Ranjit) So Tuesday, when Marshall heard this message...","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17008","Marshall","It not return until Thursday. It was all the way here and not return until Thursday. I feel stupid. Listen, they say nothing to Lily about everything, OK? Especially the part where thou dredges.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17009","Robin","I've not dredged.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17010","Marshall","That's it.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17011","Ted (2030)","Then Wednesday...","04","13","Three Days of Snow"

"17013","Marshall","The whole thing was a sign. Let us end this ancient ritual. I will not get it.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17014","Ted","Robin you really dredged?","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17015","Marshall","Dude, that was weird.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17016","Man","Guys, this festival is great! You are true friends of Hens fighting. If necessary, do not hesitate to ask.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17017","Barney","The flute section does she see anyone?","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17018","Ted","You're not really looking for it?","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17019","Marshall","Really.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17020","Ted","So, on New Year's kiss, calls for lunch, all... ""I ate it today,"" you're really going to drop it?","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17021","Marshall","Yes, really.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17022","Ted (2030)","Which brings us to Thursday.","04","13","Three Days of Snow"
"17023","Marshall","A muffin, a pastrami sandwich, and chips. I know that lunch is over, but I love you. I love you Lily, more and more each day. Happy New Year. That means I have to bring a band at the airport now?","04","13","Three Days of Snow"

"17101","Marshall","No, guys... it does not work like that. Robin will have its license if it works in his field. You could stay if you got married to a U.S. citizen. Yes, it might work. No. The procedure to formalize it would take too much time. It will not work.","04","14","The Possimpible"

"17107","Ted","You've put champion dunk in your CV?","04","14","The Possimpible"

"17121","Robin","Tell me, other girls in your class have the dancer's hip?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17122","Marshall","Sure.","04","14","The Possimpible"

"17131","Ted","And a little Scottish.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17132","Barney","The first thing to know about success is that it will not come to you. Most people associate success with money and power, but in fact it is a mindset.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17133","Ted","You were supposed to be on a motorcycle to say that?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17134","Barney","And when it comes to success, the only limit is that there is no limit.","04","14","The Possimpible"

"17142","Ted","It's you again...? You sing a song about you?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17143","Barney","Absolutely not. It would be stupid. Stinson, Barney Stinson singing this song, it would be really stupid. One of the fans who think this guy is awesome. Perfect and available.Great, Great, Great, Great, Great, Great... Great, great. Barney Stinson, committed. This jewel has earned me 11 jobs.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17144","Ted","Impossible.","04","14","The Possimpible"

"17162","Robin","Since I was little...","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17163","Barney","Cut! You're mired in details. We need you to be vague, at ease with buzzwords like ""synergy"" and ""dynamism"". You can invent a word, as... ""Relationality.""","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17164","Robin","How does make me feel stupid commit somewhere?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17165","Barney","All right. Do not do it. There are many exciting stories to cover in Canada. I just read it, the nephew of the mayor of Winnipeg went fishing on the ice and took a pole of 7 Kg Live from the worst place in the world, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.","04","14","The Possimpible"

"17173","Marshall","I know. I think... I would say... average.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17174","Lily","Why do you dance much, and I do not know why?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17175","Marshall","I do that when I'm alone. When something good happens, and I'm excited and move, and I... I dunno, I want to talk about it.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17176","Lily","You hurt the hip like that?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17177","Man","You're aware of? They give us half a day. One can start at 14h.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17178","Marshall","Super! Thank you, Herm.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17179","Robin","These clothes are ridiculous. In addition, the armor of the amazon princess itch.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17180","Barney","Showdown. You're not the first to wear it here. But it expresses the power. And that, too. Now, I need you break these 15 bricks with your forehead.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17181","Robin","What? But you do anything in your video. You were right next to a horse and sitting on a motorcycle.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17182","Barney","I am a man. You're a woman. Assume that you can do nothing. You must prove that society is wrong.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17183","Robin","I can not break 15 bricks with my forehead.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17184","Barney","There is more in 1950. Yes, you can.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17185","Robin","I'm off.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17186","Barney","Why?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17187","Robin","It will not help me find a job. I'm going to evict. I know what to do. (Robin enters an office) This is where the auditions for the daughter of lottery?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17188","Ted (2030)","So your Aunt Robin had hit bottom. She auditioned to be the daughter of lottery.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17189","Robin","And the lotto numbers for tonight are...","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17190","Man 1","Wait... Say the text before pressing the button.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17191","Male 2","It creates suspense.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17192","Man 1","It creates suspense.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17193","Robin","And the lotto numbers for tonight are... 17...","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17194","Man 2","Stop it.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17195","Man 1","Wait.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17196","Man 2","Why she says like that? It's as if she did not care so that the 17. She looks nasty.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17197","Man 1","Yes, she looks super wicked. You can repeat ""17"" for us?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17198","Robin","17.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17199","Man 2","I even understand what it does.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17200","Man 1","Let me try something. Try to be a little disillusioned.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17201","Robin","Disillusioned? On the 17th?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17202","Man 1","Disillusioned with a small...","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17203","Man 2","crackling.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17204","Man 1","... sparkle.","04","14","The Possimpible"

"17206","Man 1","It was great!","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17207","Ted","I've taken a light beer. I know the dancers count calories.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17208","Marshall","It's not funny. The doctor said if it gets worse, I should have surgery.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17209","Ted","As a vaginal rejuvenation?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17210","Marshall","You know who has not made a lot of vaginas in college?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17211","Ted","Who?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17212","Marshall","Dr. X.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17213","Ted","It was perfect!","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17214","Lily","You know what? The two geniuses are going to remove that crap on their CV. You're not Dr. X, and you can not do the dunk. Forget.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17215","Ted","Marshall and I are the only ones here with sh1t on our resume?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17216","Lily","What are you insinuating?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17217","Marshall","I know! Does July 4, 1995 does remind you of anything?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17218","Lily","A species of b*st*rd.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17219","Referee","End! And the new champion with 29 hot dogs, Lily ""The Belly"" Aldrin.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17220","Ted","What it's related to your job as mistress?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17221","Lily","It teaches kids... I can eat a lot of hot dogs very quickly.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17222","Marshall","Yes, but you can not!","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17223","Lily","You can dunk over, hip cardboard!","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17224","Marshall","How dare you? These hips can...","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17225","Ted","Guys!","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17226","Robin","I have not even been taken as the daughter of lottery. I must leave Canada.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17227","Lily","I think so.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17228","Robin","I remember the night before. They made me a farewell party. They gave me a camera to take pictures and send them home. Everyone was sure I will have much success. You will really miss.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17229","Barney","What's the matter?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17230","Ted","Robin must leave Canada.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17231","Barney","Oh, my God. It's horrible. It'll be along to commute.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17232","Robin","What do you mean?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17233","Barney","I've finished your video resume myself. I posted it to all channels of the city. A guy called from Channel 8. He adores you. He wants you to pass an audition.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17234","Robin","My God!","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17235","Barney","I said no. Robin Scherbatsky do not audition. He is given the job or anything.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17236","Robin","So, I have the job.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17237","Barney","No. He cursed me and hung up. But after Channel 12, called. They'll love it too. They offer you to host their new talk show in the morning.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17238","Robin","It's amazing!","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17239","Barney","I sent them sh1t.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17240","Robin","Dude!","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17241","Barney","They want you even more. So they increased their offer by 10%. Congratulations. Looks like you'll have to stay.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17242","Lily","You're not going to dance?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17243","Marshall","It's OK. Later.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17244","Robin","How did you do that?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17245","Barney","I am the master of possimpossible.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17246","Robin","Yes. Thank you.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17247","Ted (2030)","So, thanks to your uncle Barney, it was possible to keep your Aunt Robin. And the others decided it was time to drop some things. Finally, except Lily.","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17248","Marshall","That one is good. And... end! What is the total?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17249","Ted","33!","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17250","Ted","Why nobody comes to my events?","04","14","The Possimpible"
"17251","Lily","Look. Three beautiful blondes drinking bad decision juice at 8am.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17252","Marshall","Pretty radar chest. This is my wife.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17253","Barney","No, I must go.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17254","Lily","Seriously? They are blond and stuffed. This is not your type?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17255","Barney","Maybe I did not like. My God, you think that the male spirit is really so simple, we all have a favorite type? Lord.Asian, big tits. I go to the bathroom, then I'm going.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17256","Lily","You noticed that Barney is weird lately?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17257","Ted","Actually, yes. You know, he never gives flowers to a girl, because living things remind babies?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17258","Lily","Yes.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17259","Ted","The other day I saw him in a flower shop on the 82nd, he bought roses.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17260","Robin","What?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17261","Marshall","Now that you say, Barney did something weird yesterday at the office.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17262","Barney","OK, to Saturday. (Marshall is in the doorway) I was thinking of a brunch, and perhaps a hike. I love you too.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17263","Marshall","I thought he was talking to a girl he just wanted to jump. Or Ted, but now I know more.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17264","Lily","You think it is possible that Barney Stinson has a girlfriend?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17265","Barney","A plus.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17266","Lily","Wait. Where are you going?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17267","Barney","Nowhere. At the beach. It's winter. Laser Tag. At home. Shut up! It is you who are going somewhere.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17268","Lily","My God. He goes to see now.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17269","Marshall","Where is Barney?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17270","Ted","Yeah. It is even more in Manhattan. Where does this girl?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17271","Robin","We talk about a woman that Barney Stinson has worked. I vote for Narnia.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17272","Ted","He stops.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17273","Barney","What are you doing here?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17274","Lily","Where is she?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17275","Barney","Who?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17276","Lily","Your girlfriend. You did not really like, huh?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17277","Barney","These are my friends. Ted, Marshall, Lily and Robin.Guys, here is Loretta. My mother.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17278","Loretta","Nice to meet you. I feel I already know you. Barney can not stop talking about you every day.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17279","Robin","You call your mother every day?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17280","Barney","Mom!","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17281","Lily","So that's what we hide you? You did not want people to know that you're a momma's boy.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17282","Barney","Yes, you got me. I guess you can leave.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17283","Woman","Hello.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17284","Robin","Hi.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17285","Woman","Who are these people?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17286","Barney","Ted, Marshall, Lily, Robin. I present to you Betty... my wife. And my son, Tyler.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17287","Loretta","Betty and I are going to prepare dinner. There will be something for everyone.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17288","Betty","But forget, one meatloaf, after what was said Dr. Grossbard on your cholesterol.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17289","Barney","She wants me to live long.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17290","Betty","Guilty. I love you.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17291","Barney","Me too.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17292","Tyler","Me-seven!","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17293","Barney","Will in, little rascal! I'll see you at the bar?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17294","Robin","What's that, Barney?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17295","Barney","It's a long story. As you know, my father had to leave my mother when I was a baby because he became presenter of the Just Price.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17296","Robin","Very good program.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17297","Marshall","Bob Barker is your father.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17298","Barney","She had to raise my brother and I, all alone. And his only wish was that his son did not end up alone like her. And there seven years, she fell ill.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17299","Barney","I do not think she was going to make. So I decided to fulfill his wish. Mom. This is Betty. We're engaged.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17300","Barney","I hired an actress to play my girlfriend ""Betty"". His real name is Margaret. It is mainly small theaters. Superb actress.In it a Moliere. I say no more. This is political. I should not talk about it. But there is a problem. Betty has a slight tendency to improvise.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17301","Barney","You see, Mom? I found someone who makes me happy. As you wished.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17302","Loretta","It's beautiful. I wish I could stay for small children.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17303","Betty","I'm pregnant!","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17304","Barney","And then my mother went better. It was miraculous.But I had to keep ""Betty"" and make a casting to find my son, Tyler.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17305","Lily","It's crazy. Did you actually cast your own son?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17306","Barney","For a while, it was enough to borrow / keep the baby from neighbors. And once at Christmas, my mother was drunk at the grog, I went out with a bag of flour and a Chucky mask.But eventually I had to audition.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17307","Barney","four, eight... thirteen, you stay. The other, you can leave.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17308","Woman","You said if I slept with you, my son would have the role.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17309","Barney","Apparently I'm better actor than your son. Bring those from 11!","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17310","Barney","And that's how the role of Tyler went to... Grant.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17311","Ted","Come on, Grant looks pretty good.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17312","Barney","Really? Look. Tyler? Tyler? Tyler? Grant?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17313","Grant","Yes?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17314","Barney","You see? This is amateur work. Believe me, the child stars had better possession in the 80s.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17315","Lily","It sounds like your mother kept your child's room as you had left.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17316","Marshall","It's a huge Karate Kid poster above your bed.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17317","Barney","Karate Kid's a great movie. This is the story of a young karate enthusiast whose dreams led him to Karate Championship All Star Valley. Unfortunately, he loses in the final against another loser. But he learned an important lesson in accepting his defeat.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17318","Lily","Wait. When you watch Karate Kid, you are the wicked little blonde?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17319","Barney","No, I'm for the other loser from New Jersey who barely knows karate. When I watch Karate Kid, I'm for real karate kid  Johnny Lawrence of Cobra Kai dojo. Do not get dumber than you are, Lily.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17320","Ted","I just remembered where I know you. I saw you play at the theater of disorientation, Die heilige Johanna der Schlachth&ouml;fe by Bertolt Brecht, last fall. You were a revelation!","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17321","Betty","Really?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17322","Ted","Yes.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17323","Betty","Thank you. I know not, finally, the purpose of Brecht's work is of course...","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17324","Ted and Betty","... to confuse people.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17325","Ted","Yes. Sorry. You got a Brechtophile before thee!","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17326","Betty","You know it really theater.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17327","Ted","Mrs Theatre has won my heart once and has never left me. Every year at Christmas, I created a piece for parents with all the kids.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17328","Boy","Hey, Santa, do you think we can take off with this weather?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17329","Ted","Cut! Cut! Grandpa and Grandma will be there in half an hour, and you always skinned my words. I feel like I'm going to write, direct and play this thing. Give me your elf hat. Sit down.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17330","Ted","I always wanted to be an actor. It is this kind of dream that flies away with time.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17331","Betty","Look, if you want, I can give you advice as an actor.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17332","Ted","Really?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17333","Betty","I would love. Rule number one player...","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17334","Grant","At least one person who still loves to play. I miss that.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17335","Robin","You do not like playing the son of Barney?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17336","Grant","I hate. But what can I do? I get no phone call.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17337","Robin","I know what it is. I am a presenter. But I had to accept a job on a morning show that starts at 4 30. I thought evolve much faster than that, you know? I'm almost 30 years.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17338","Grant","Come on, you're still beautiful. I love your new nose.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17339","Robin","I have not had surgery.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17340","Grant","That's it. Neither do I.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17341","Lily","I can not believe that there has never met you. Who knew that Barney's mother was so great?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17342","Loretta","Thank you, darling. Actually, I was not so perfect a mother when I was younger.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17343","Marshall","Do not say that. I'm sure you were great.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17344","Loretta","Yeah, I was rather a drag.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17345","Lily","I'm sorry?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17346","Loretta","A drag, darling. A dirty streak. I am not proud. But...Finally, I had fun. There's no pleasure as intense as... to watch a guy in the eye and say, ""I do not know your name, and you either, but... the next eight minutes we're going to flinch foundations of this gas station toilet. "" Then to proceed in opposite directions. And just drive.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17347","Marshall","Barney Mom? Loretta.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17348","Loretta","Finally, all this is history now. I did the best I could, but... Sometimes, I wonder how Barney was able to become so perfect.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17349","Marshall","You must tell the truth to your mother, OK? Listen, this is a nice woman, loving, a little too direct that deserves better.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17350","Barney","No, no question. The truth would kill her.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17351","Marshall","I do not feel well to the idea of lying to a woman so warm, OK? It reminds me of my mother. What?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17352","Lily","Warm? Remember to marriage, I said we would be together forever? On our return down the aisle, your mother leaned over and said, ""Not forever, darling. Marshall will go to heaven. ""","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17353","Marshall","She was joking.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17354","Lily","She hates me, Marshall. But that's okay, because...Forget.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17355","Marshall","You're going to say what?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17356","Lily","Nothing. You want to go do it again in the bedroom of Barney?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17357","Barney","On the bed ""race car""?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17358","Marshall","The handles are great. Listen, Lily, if you learned something today, is that honesty is important in a family.Whatever your feelings about my mother, we've been together for 12 years, baby. I think I can handle it.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17359","Lily","Really? I hate your mother.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17360","Marshall","You know what? I hate you!","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17361","Loretta","In two minutes, meat loaf!","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17362","Tyler","Meatloaf? Tyler to love!","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17363","Barney","We talked about it a million times! You get no slogan!","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17364","Grant","But it's funny.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17365","Barney","I can make another cast. Will remember your sentences for the big dinner scene.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17366","Robin","Wait. You wrote that we will have dinner?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17367","Barney","Just a little script. Things that my mother will be pleased to hear.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17368","Robin","What kind?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17369","Betty","And I really thought that Barney had forgot our anniversary. So I rushed into the garden, smoke coming out of my ears.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17370","Barney","The nostrils dilated. They do it when she gets mad. I love it. As now. Like now!","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17371","Betty","You better stop!","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17372","Barney","Sorry, my little bear. Continues. You really like that for a relationship.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17373","Betty","So I go out raging in the garden, and... candles everywhere... and a string quartet. You come to believe?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17374","Lily","No, not at all.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17375","Loretta","And my boy Ty-Ty. What's new?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17376","Barney","Funny story, the other night, this little rascal had a nightmare. He came to tell us what it was, you remember what you said?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17377","Tyler","Well...","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17378","Barney","Page 4...","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17379","Tyler","The dinosaur bones at the museum have come back to life and chasing me?","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17380","Marshall","Thank you very much, man. Tonight I will not sleep.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17381","Barney","Tyler said  ""In my nightmare, mom and you did not know how much I loved you. So I'm here to say it was great...like that. ""","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17382","Loretta","It was cute.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17383","Barney","We're a happy family.","04","15","The Stinsons"
"17384","Loretta","I will take a little ice in the freezer downstairs and make the ice creams in the kitchen.","04","15","The Stinsons"

"17653","Robin","What is the result with the bimbo?","04","16","Sorry, Bro"

"17696","Karen","OK, you're right. I'm good in literature. Gifted in art.Good at identifying a French wine for less than a kilometer from where the grapes grew. But... I'm really bad to watch someone and say what I feel.","04","16","Sorry, Bro"

"17836","Lily","So you're really angry?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17837","Ted","I know. I mean, I guess if you get all this for Karen, then it may be better.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17838","Lily","I'm really sorry. I hated to do it again, but Karen had to leave.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17839","Ted","""Redo""? How many times you made me break with my girlfriends?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17840","Lily","Never! Six.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17841","Ted","Like who?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17842","Lily","No one! Angie. In the second year. She used you to get revenge on her ex, and you will not see it, so...","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17843","Lily","... one day she was taking a nap...","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17844","Ted","Creed? Oh, my God, I have to break up with her.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17845","Marshall","That's where is my CD of Creed.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17846","Ted","Who else?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17847","Lily","Do you remember this strange girl who wanted you to marry him after two months? You loved him in trouble, but you thought there anyway, so...","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17848","Woman","Look, Ted, you're great, and it is very difficult, but I think it does not look the same. So, long life and prosperity. Or something else.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17849","Ted","That was you? It's crazy!","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17850","Lily","Ted, I did it to help you. You're addicted to the commitment. You fell in love with these women, even if they do not deserve you.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17851","Ted","And if one of them was to be the mother of my children?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17852","Lily","If there was any chance, I swear, I would have done anything. As Victoria or Stella.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17853","Ted","Or Robin. Or Robin. You made us break too? You made us break too?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17854","Lily","Stop talking to me as if I were your enemy! You know these women cry, but you have the luxury of not knowing what I know  you have these breaks tragic surely avoided a first marriage crap and very expensive.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17855","Ted","You have made us break up?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17856","Lily","You do not want the truth, because deep down, you want me to watch over you. And basically, you know that none of these women would have been the mother of your children.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17857","Ted","You have made us break up?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17858","Lily","I did what I had to do.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17859","Ted","You have made us break up?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17860","Lily","Just as I did!","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17861","Barney by nightdress","Your grandfather was a wise Olaf.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17862","Ted","You made me break with Robin?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17863","Lily","No, it's not...","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17864","Ted","I can not believe it. I need another drink.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17865","Barney","I feel a little breeze there. It's nice.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17866","Marshall","You think that's good? Come to the mouth of heating.It's like your bazaar was on a tropical island.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17867","Barney","The Little Barney says ""Mahalo.""","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17868","Ted","Seriously, just what is your problem? How could you do that?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17869","Lily","I did it because I care about you!","04","17","The Front Porch"

"17874","Robin","The routine.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17875","Ted","Lily has just told us it made us break.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17876","Robin","What? We do break? What does that mean? And why they wear a night gown?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17877","Marshall","A shirt.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17878","Barney","It's called a shirt.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17879","Ted","It turns out that Lily has decided to sabotage many of my relationships, including ours.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17880","Lily","Robin was different. I did not mean that you break, but you wanted different things and you refused to settle it. I could imagine the porch.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17881","Ted, old","2 of heart. As the heart of two children that I have ever had, because my lovely wife hates children.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17882","Robin, old","Equality. As my career that fell when I decided to settle down and marry Ted. Bridge! I won.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17883","Marshall","I do not like this scenario.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17884","Lily","I was just trying to make you talk about your problems. I did not know it would lead to your break.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17885","Lily","I have a funny joke. Where you see yourself in five years?(Later that night, Lily is with Robin at McClaren's) You know what's funny? Funny questions. Where you see yourself in five years?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17886","Ted","Where do you see yourself in five years?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17887","Robin","And you?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17888","Lily","Not that I want to make you say, but surely you want to get married.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17889","Ted","I would probably get married.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17890","Lily","You would surely be in Tokyo or Paris.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17891","Robin","I would surely be in Argentina.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17892","Ted","In Argentina?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17893","Robin","Or Tokyo, or Paris.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17894","Ted","We have a deadline, does not it?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17895","Robin","My God.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17896","Ted","You can not manipulate people like that! I've known you for 12 years, but I've never been back!","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17897","Lily","I was not...","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17898","Ted","I want to hear!","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17899","Barney","Calm down! Let us be calm! I have a question. This is how when you're in bed?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17900","Marshall","Come, let's check.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17901","Robin","So, without you we would come out still together?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17902","Lily","Or you'd been together too long, and would have had an incredibly bitter break without even remain friends, and we would never become best friends.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17903","Robin","Do not say that.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17904","Ted","Stop cuddling! You got no right to interfere in my relationships you. You're lucky. You have found the love of your life in a dorm you turn 18. It gives you no right to play God while others are still looking for. You worry so much about who will finish with you on the porch. You know what? Keep it for you.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17905","Lily","It is what happened to your jacket?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17906","Robin","Soot, breadcrumbs, placenta. You have not even registered?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17907","Barney","You're at home, every night, and Lily layer always with you?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17908","Marshall","Yeah, marriage, man, unconditional love. You can wear what you want and you get laid.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17909","Barney","Tell me about marriage.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17910","Marshall","Sometimes when you're married, the smell of breakfast wakes you ready.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17911","Barney","The coffee too?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17912","Marshall","The cafe also. Sometimes she even puts a vase of fresh flowers.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17913","Barney","I love flowers. And sometimes when you're afraid of making wrong choices and you're not the one you wanted to be, what it does?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17914","Marshall","It says you're great and everything will be fine.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17915","Barney","It's beautiful. And it helps you to find other girls to sleep with?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17916","Marshall","I guess. If you have agreed, perhaps. The guy had a hard day. We'll talk tomorrow. Good night, champ.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17917","Ted (2030)","The next night, I always wanted your aunt Lily.Until...","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17918","Karen","What are you doing... (She kisses him before he finished his sentence) Lily rose and explained everything to me. And she gave me this for you.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17919","Lily","Ted, I'm sorry. No matter who you marry. I know it will be great because she will think you are. To prove my sincerity, I have prepared a surprise for you and Karen at the top. Kisses, Lily.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17920","Marshall","PS  Sorry that the envelope is opened. I read what she wrote. Marshall.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17921","Karen","Sabotaging our relationship? I must admit that even setting the bar really low for judging friends, Lily really outdid themselves. Clearly, we can not see her again. I know. It's hard, huh?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17922","Karen, old","Do you remember your college roommate? He was married to this girl's voice rattle.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17923","Ted, old","It's been so long.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17924","Karen, old","My God, I hated him. Finally, here is his obituary.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17925","Ted","I realized that no matter what my friends think of my girlfriend, but it really matters what my girlfriend thinks of my friends.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17926","Robin","So, it's over?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17927","Ted","Yes. If you wanna be my guest, Lily is a sacred stove.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17928","Robin","beef pie, macaroni and cheese, butter cookie house.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17929","Ted","Normal Marshall dies at age 68.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17930","Robin","Thank you.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17931","Ted (2030)","And with Robin, we're treated to a gourmet dinner.For her breakfast. And we ended up doing exactly what Lily wanted us to do  talk about our relationship.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17932","Robin","Basically, Lily made us break.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17933","Ted","It makes you wonder.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17934","Robin","If it had not been there, we always go out together?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17935","Ted","Maybe. She was right. We were not ready. We needed to move forward, we do our stuff. It is always the case.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17936","Robin","We should make a pact. If the years pass and only 40 years old, one is always alone...","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17937","Ted","Will you be my wife back?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17938","Robin","A girl dreams of hearing those words. A million times, yes!","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17939","Ted","Okay, that's it. Do we must etablire rules?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17940","Robin","Genre?","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17941","Ted","I know. As not to become huge, that sort of thing.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17942","Robin","Just one thing  no nightgown.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17943","Ted","I'll never wear.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17944","Woman","Too bad.","04","17","The Front Porch"
"17945","Ted (2030)","In spring 2009, I was hired to design a new headquarters for Goliath National Bank. And I hasten to add up to the plans of architect my paw.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17946","Ted","Wooden beams immersed in natural light from the atrium.They will love it!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17947","Ted (2030)","There was a problem and his name was Bilson.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17948","Bilson","Wood? Natural light? Oh, no! It reminds employees that there is an outside world where they have family and friends. We want to crush it! You arrive in the dark, you come home in the dark. You spend your whole damn day in the dark!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17949","Marshall","I need to hear Lily.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17950","Bilson","Who told you to leave?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17951","Ted (2030)","Bilson killed every one of my original ideas. Then one day the GNB has withdrawn from the project to create a new working group to oversee my plans. Everything changed at once.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17952","Ted","On the roof, a Zen garden to pray silently. In the lobby, a fountain where local kids can make wishes. The new GNB, your workplace and your home. Thank you, and.. welcome home.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17953","Ted (2030)","Everything was fine until one day in the elevator.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17954","Ted","Yeah, it's Ted. No, no. I have not approved the change in plans for the new GNB headquarters, which I am the chief architect, just 30 years. Yes, I'm single and I give to charity.What is the relationship? Okay, bye, Mr. Mayor. You know it was bogus?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17955","Woman","Yes, and I also know that the draft of the new headquarters was abandoned last month. Nice try.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17956","Barney","Look at Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars. If I could get a celebrity, it would be Scarlett Johansson. Canon, talented and you do not turn as Woody Allen's father without issue.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17957","Marshall","If I got a celebrity, it would be Lily. This is the star of my heart.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17958","Lily","For me it would be Hugh Jackman.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17959","Robin","You know, the celebrities, they like really weird s*x stuff. Believe me.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17960","Barney","How do you know that?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17961","Robin","It's embarrassing, but I... I came home one evening with a celebrity.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17962","Lily","My God! Seriously?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17963","Robin","He wanted to do weird things with me, so I left. That's it.End of story.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17964","Lily","No, not the end of history. I need to know who, what, when and where. Balance!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17965","Marshall","Please, calm down. You swallow too much air.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17966","Barney","But before you poursuives, I'm flattered, but technically I'm not a celebrity. Also, one last time, the mask, it was a joke.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17967","Robin","Not you, Barney.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17968","Lily","Who's who?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17969","Marshall","Now you've spun him hiccups.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17970","Robin","I'll tell you anything specific. But all I will say is that he is Canadian, but you know it. And he brought home by offering to show me a single collection.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17971","Marshall","What do you mean ""collection""?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17972","Robin","As you collect stamps or coins. But I say nothing.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17973","Barney","Tell us at least the weird thing he wanted to do.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17974","Robin","I know not what you call it, but we have a name for it in Canada. Listen, I've already said too much.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17975","Lily","So the mystery celebrity who collects something mysterious asked you to do a mystery Canadian s*x act.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17976","Robin","Yes.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17977","Lily","Tell us.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17978","Robin","I'll tell you. But only if you correctly guess the three parties.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17979","Marshall","It is simply impossible.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17980","Robin","Right.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17981","Lily","I do not even know of Canadian s*x act.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17982","Barney","You have the Sled Dog, the Lobster Trap, the Mounted Police.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17983","Lily","How do you know that?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17984","Barney","Canadiansexact.org, this is a favorite.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17985","Marshall","Point org?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17986","Barney","Yeah. It's nonprofit. They just want to disseminate information.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17987","Ted","I just had a conversation strange. A woman at the GNB told me that the new tower was abandoned last month. It's crazy, right? What is this look?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17988","Barney","It is said? It should.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17989","Marshall","No. I want to.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17990","Barney","There's been no light.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17991","Ted","What's going on?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17992","Marshall","It's time you know. A few weeks ago, Bilson called us.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17993","Bilson","We abandon the project for the new headquarters. This recession is killing us. It cancels all the superfluous. And I have difficult choices to make during my semi retirement in St. Croix.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17994","Marshall","Dude, Ted will be devastated.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17995","Bilson","Not if he learns his best friend.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17996","Marshall and Barney","I have to say?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17997","Marshall","Tell him, you're his best friend.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17998","Barney","No, it's you.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"17999","Marshall","No, it's really you. Shhh, it happens.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18000","Barney","White or Asian? You see, I hardly know him.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18001","Ted","How are you?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18002","Marshall","You okay?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18003","Ted","I'm frustrated. The least innovative thing in my drawings, Bilson cuts with a machete. I hate to depend on what kind of guy.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18004","Barney","You should leave the project.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18005","Marshall","It is clear, leave him. It is unworthy of you.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18006","Barney","It's decided. A new beginning! May the winds be with you...","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18007","Ted","Are you kidding? They still come to turn a guy in my box.Bilson, is heavy, it is clear, but without this project, I have more work.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18008","Barney","It's funny you mention the project. Because...","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18009","Marshall","You're super good. Keep it up, man. Your hair, your teeth are beautiful now. You shine like a diamond!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18010","Ted","Thank you. I needed it. Well, I go back to work. I must insert a plank in the dark hallway of Bilson. You have understood me.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18011","Barney","What was that?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18012","Marshall","I have an idea. The next two months Ted has paid anyway. We could not let it continue and not to tell her? He had a tough year. Let the fun a little.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18013","Barney","You suggest a complicated lie in the long term that implies a lot of discipline. A guy like you will not succeed.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18014","Marshall","But if I can.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18015","Barney","Lie to me, there.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18016","Marshall","I have a spaceship.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18017","Barney","What kind of fuel?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18018","Marshall","I have no spaceship.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18019","Barney","But no! Defend yourself! If someone asks, diverts it from the original lie with other lies. I show you. I have a pony.Question me.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18020","Marshall","It is what color?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18021","Barney","When I was Dandelion, her complexion was of a deep hazel, unfortunately, his barn is located near a chemical plant, which contaminated water. Over time, it became a dull gray and the vet can not do anything to help.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18022","Marshall","My God! It's horrible. Dandelion will make it? Okay...You're strong! Dandelion is not sick, huh?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18023","Ted","So the tour is canceled and you really have lied to me.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18024","Marshall","We did it to protect you.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18025","Ted","I think so. My two best friends have planted and I saw nothing.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18026","Lily","In Canada, it's called a snow plow Vicious.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18027","Ted","This tower was the dream job and it went up in smoke.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18028","Marshall","Sorry, Ted.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18029","Ted","I need a drink.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18030","Lily","The poor. It's moved if I return to Canada on s*x?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18031","Marshall","Not at all.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18032","Barney","You've been slow.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18033","Lily","What is a Zamboni with 2 hands?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18034","Robin","Well, the only thing that carries the woman is skates with his hands.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18035","Lily","Pack milk Manitoba?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18036","Robin","It's like the Moustache of Chicago, but the person below wearing a combi.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18037","Lily","A Lobster Trap of Newfoundland?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18038","Robin","I dunno, I want to know. These people are crazy.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18039","Lily","Well, I decided my first proposal.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18040","Robin","Okay, but I say only if you find the person, the act and the collection.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18041","Lily","Well, I'm starting. Bryan Adams. He collects baseball cards and he wanted to make you... an oily Kayak.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18042","Robin","No.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18043","Barney","Wayne Gretzky, former Hot Wheels, an Eskimo kneeling.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18044","Robin","No.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18045","Marshall","Kiefer Sutherland, souvenir glasses, tights and a Pancake.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18046","Robin","No. I would have accepted it.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18047","Ted","Wait. If they canceled the project a month ago, why did I go every week to see the new working group?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18048","Barney","Of course, you could not see you point and Bilson.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18049","Marshall","So we... invented the working group. It was enough just to gather a team.","04","18","Old King Clancy"

"18053","Louisa","I speak English.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18054","Marshall","Exactly. This is an important secret. How do you say ""secret"" in Spanish?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18055","Louisa","Pellets?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18056","Marshall","Okay. Albondigas. This will be our little albondigas. I have balls, please? Arthur and Nasmith, the eccentric genius, investment guru, it's actually... Arty the cracked one-man band of 15th Street. (In the street...) Excuse me. One can argue?","04","18","Old King Clancy"

"18061","Lily","Alex Trebek, a Guardian Eventé, teddy bear!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18062","Robin","No.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18063","Lily","Damn!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18064","Ted","Wait. It explains what happened to Louisa.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18065","Marshall","Good job.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18066","Barney","All right!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18067","Ted","Louisa. What can we do about it? Do not like you not understand. You feel the same. After all!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18068","Louisa","No, I can not. I am engaged to Mr. Barney. We do not care. We live once!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18069","Ted","No, it's not good! Damn, you're in the working group!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18070","Ted","Is there anything else you want to tell me?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18071","Marshall","When you played third base for the softball team GNB.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18072","Barney","There is no softball team. We just rented a field, a bunch of guys together so they make you a hero.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18073","Ted","My lap of honor was bogus?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18074","Marshall","Sorry, we knew you'd be unemployed soon. We wanted you to feel good. Friends do that.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18075","Ted","Lying?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18076","Marshall","Sometimes, yes, to protect them.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18077","Ted","False! Never lie to his friends. I should never have lied.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18078","Barney","Really? And this open mic night at the Comedy Club?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18079","Marshall","You're like me, people? Have you ever considered the amount of fish species? And... the name of these fish?Here are a few. ""Trout. ""Right? ""Sturgeon. ""I think so buddy.""Salmon. ""I'll say it again... Salmon. Who thought it was a good idea? ""Bar. ""This guy is what I mean. ""Halibut. ""Thank you, good evening. How do I?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18080","Ted","Super. Very funny.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18081","Barney","Fatal... Thursday evening for everyone.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18082","Marshall","Timeout. You do not like fish?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18083","Ted","It was horrible! You've just read a list of fish.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18084","Marshall","Whatever... This proves my point. You lied to me to protect me.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18085","Ted","It has nothing to do! I lost one month of my life to work on a dead project. I could have spent that time to find new contracts. Instead, I'll go tomorrow morning and probably get fired. Best Screenplay, my boss yelling at me going in front of everyone.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18086","Robin","For me, it's called a...","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18087","Lily","A Totem of Saskatoon. It's here.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18088","Ted","Hello, lying bastards. No lies before I go to work to get fired?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18089","Barney","Nice shirt.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18090","Ted","You're the devil.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18091","Marshall","What if we told you that you found another project to GNB, where you have to redo part of the 20th floor.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18092","Ted","If it's a lie, it's really bad. And I will do what?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18093","Barney","This is the P.T.E. 18th floor. Basically, Bilson wants a piece like that, two floors above us.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18094","Ted","Wait, what is a P.T.E.?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18095","Barney","Room for Transitional Employees.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18096","Ted","What does that mean?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18097","Barney","It's a place where a manager and an employee initiate a transfer of knowledge about an impending career change.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18098","Marshall","It turns people here.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18099","Ted","It's horrible. Why have a special room to turn people?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18100","Marshall","GNB think we need a safe place to meet new.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18101","Barney","It's serious there.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18102","Ted (2030)","Reluctantly, I agreed to design a room where people turn. But I was determined to put my key.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18103","Ted","Leaving space dismissal, you get into what I call ""the Renaissance Corridor Quiet."" Here, an oval room of rest with psychological support. Right there, after the fountain of the New Departure. And here it is. Instead of a sad and gloomy cell, a protective womb... giving birth to a new life.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18104","Bilson","I love.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18105","Barney","Really?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18106","Bilson","Good job, Ted.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18107","Ted","Thank you.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18108","Bilson","You can add these keys to the PTE the 18th floor?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18109","Ted","Absolutely.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18110","Bilson","Awesome. 'll See about that.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18111","Ted","OK, I think this wall...","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18112","Bilson","You're fired!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18113","Ted","What?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18114","Bilson","I wanted this piece! This same room, two floors up!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18115","Ted","But...","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18116","Bilson","You're fired! Away from here. (His phone rings and Ted lot) Hi, honey.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18117","Lily","Anyone of Rush, a Meat Pie from Montreal and a lunchbox superhero.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18118","Robin","No.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18119","Lily","Rick Moranis, the Reverse Rich Moranis, of Jewish antiquities. I give up. It's been three days that I seek. I stop. If that means I could ever be.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18120","Robin","Well.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18121","Lily","Tell us about it!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18122","Robin","You really want to know?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18123","Marshall, Lily and Barney","Yes!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18124","Robin","But this info does not leave the table.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18125","Lily","My God. I am so excited. (Robin passes him a paper) I will read.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18126","Barney","Read it.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18127","Marshall","Read it.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18128","Lily","I will read it. Let's go. ""The Frozen Snowshoe,"" ""Old King Clancy"", ""The Plateaux of Harvey.""","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18129","Robin","So?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18130","Lily","I do not understand any of these words.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18131","Barney","One of them is supposed to be famous?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18132","Marshall","Who the hell... The Old King Clancy is?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18133","Robin","This is not the person is the sexual act. It's like the Sacramento Turtleneck, but with maple syrup.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18134","Marshall","And fame, this is Harvey Léplateaux?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18135","Robin","No, it's the collection. Harvey trays. These orange trays they give you when you eat at Harvey. Restaurants? Will you take a trip on the Trans-Canada Highway, you have a hollow between Milverton and Wawa, where you stop eating, eh? At Harvey. More than 12,000 customers!","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18136","Lily","So fame was...","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18137","Robin","The Frozen Snowshoe. Oh, my God! You know Racket jelly? This is the most famous pro wrestler of Canada. I met him after his victory over Rick ""The Daredevil"" at the Rogers Memorial Arena in Kamloops in 2002. A classic.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18138","Lily","So you say you Racket Jelly invited him home to show you trays of Harvey, and you've asked him to do an Old King Clancy?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18139","Robin","Right. And I'm serious, do not tell anyone.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18140","Lily","My hiccups are gone. Perhaps forever.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18141","Barney","You again. You even found a way to spoil it. Why?Why let yourself do we as a country?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18142","Marshall","Hey, Mister Whisper. You should not be up there to draw your super PTE?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18143","Ted","I'm more about the project.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18144","Marshall","What?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18145","Ted","Bilson fired me.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18146","Marshall","You're kidding.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18147","Lily","What does that mean for your company? You're going to be fired?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18148","Ted","Actually, I just resign.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18149","Marshall","Why?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18150","Ted","I can not work for large corporations with no heart. In selling me your ""working group"", I was the most inspired work of my career. In fact, you reminded me how my job could be fun when I'm not dealing with Bilson, so... I resigned.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18151","Barney","They've turned, eh?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18152","Ted","Yes, sir. But I have good benefits and I have made a great decision. I'll start my own box.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18153","Lily","It's exciting.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18154","Barney","With this economy?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18155","Marshall","So, do we want it?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18156","Ted","Ultimately, I am grateful.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18157","Barney","What was it with Bilson?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18158","Ted","After he proposed a career change, I made an impromptu presentation with a four-step approach that put him in the knee.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18159","Barney","You've hit with a chair?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18160","Ted","Yeah.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18161","Barney","Well done.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18162","Man","That one, I got to the restaurant between Milverton and Wawa.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18163","Robin","It's very impressive, The Frozen Snowshoe.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18164","Man","We're friends. Call me ""racket"". Sit down.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18165","Robin","So... Snowshoeing Would you like me... Old King Clancy one?","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18166","Snowshoeing","You should go.","04","18","Old King Clancy"
"18167","Barney","You believe not what happened last night laser tag.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18168","Ted","People freaked out because of a calibrated in suits who bothered their children?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18169","Barney","Yeah, almost.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18170","Barney","Go! You want that!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18171","Girl","My shoulder!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18172","Barney","Come on.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18173","Pattern","Stinson, in my office! Now!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18174","Barney","sh1t.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18175","Pattern","Foul Play, three stampedes, and now this! Stinson, you are a ball!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18176","Barney","I know, I'm not your precious rules, McCracken, but, damn, the results are there!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18177","McCracken","Listen, you're a good player laser tag. Perhaps the best I've seen. But someday, you will hurt someone.Maybe even you.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18178","Barney","You forget what it's there. Your fat ass is stuck here for too long.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18179","Barney","My pleasure. Do not do that. This game is all I have.And I nearly enough tickets for the remote controlled helicopter. Pity.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18180","McCracken","I can not believe I do that. But I'll leave you one last chance. But be aware, if you exceed the limits of a toe, you play the duck shooting in your mother's so fast it will make you dizzy. Get out!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18181","Barney","You regret it.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18182","McCracken","It's over, Stinson. You are banned for life!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18183","Marshall","I can not believe you're kicked out of laser tag. Are you gonna do?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18184","Barney","What shall I do? I'll tell you that Ted and I will do. We will introduce and apply the PQ everywhere.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18185","Ted","Barney, you're too old to put toilet paper because you can play laser tag more. And by the way, too old for laser tag.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18186","Barney","Ted, laser tag has no age limit. As the striptease in the West Midlle.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18187","Ted","Yeah, whatever. I added laser tag to the list of Murtaugh.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18188","Barney","No list of Murtaugh.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18189","Robin","What is the Murtaugh list?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18190","Ted (2030)","The Murtaugh list was created around my 30th birthday. It all started with the beer funnel your uncle.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18191","Marshall","... two, one, chug!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18192","Ted (2030)","In our 20 years, with each party, this funnel came out. And to our 30 years, none. Of course, at age 20, the day looked like this. (Marshall and Ted fight) But to our 30 years, the day looked like this. (Ted is sitting on the couch, the trash next to him) Then one day, in the suffering of the worst hangover of my life, I realized that one person in the world understood me  Detective Roger Murtaugh, played by Danny Glover in the masterpiece 1987  Lethal Weapon, known for his often repeated motto","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18193","Roger Murtaugh","I'm too old for this...","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18194","Ted (2030)","Stuff. He said, ""I'm too old for this stuff. ""","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18195","Ted","It's hard to admit, but with age, we can do certain things.This is why I have this list, not to make the mistake of thinking that I can still make a sleepless night.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18196","Marshall","I'm too old for this stuff.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18197","Ted","Or eat a whole pizza in one sitting.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18198","Marshall","I'm too old for this stuff.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18199","Ted","Or put posters on the wall without a frame.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18200","Marshall","""Riggs. ""I'm too old for this stuff. In fact, it's Lethal Weapon?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18201","Robin","I know. It looks pumped. An old cop associated with a young and rebellious. It reminds you of anything? Mackleroy and LaFleur. Do not tell me you have never seen Mackleroy and LaFleur. This is the best action movie of all time Canadian. Mackleroy is a young Mountie whose horse is killed by evil Americans, and LaFleur, his old partner grumpy and Afro-Canadian, just buy a nice fishing shack in northern Alberta...","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18202","Marshall","I gotta go.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18203","Lily","Hi, baby. Good workout.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18204","Robin","What? It's still one-man band? Because it was crap.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18205","Ted (2030)","In fact, Marshall was to coach the basketball team's class Lily. He thought it was funny, but Lily was dizzy  training father.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18206","Marshall","My God! Orange wedges. That's nice. What are you doing here?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18207","Lily","I could not resist. I wanted to see Marshmallow coach at work.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18208","Marshall","The children, who wants to stop earlier and eat orange slices?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18209","All","Yeah!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18210","Marshall","Yeah? No way! Oranges, it's for the winners, and you little sh1ts, you have not yet put one basket! Shame on you, shame on you Miss Aldrin, and worse, necks make me ashamed! Enough! Suicide, on the line! And make it snappy!Here we go.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18211","Barney","There's nothing on this list for which you're too old. In fact, if you did everything on the Murtaugh list, I would call it a nice weekend.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18212","Ted","Barney, you have more 18 years. If you did the whole list, you would die. It was not a challenge.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18213","Barney","Challenge accepted. The next 24 hours, I will do everything on the list. And after that, you go to the PQ laser tag with me.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18214","Ted","And if you fail?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18215","Barney","I'll spend three hours listening to you talk about architecture.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18216","Ted","It works for me. Robin, you do the honors?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18217","Robin","An agreement of honor!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18218","Barney","Come on guys, you do it!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18219","Robin","Are you sure you want to do that? You know how it is.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18220","Ted","There's some pretty hefty on the list. Finally, do you really think Barney is going to get ear pierced?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18221","Barney","""To pierce the ear. ""Done. Well, I go to a laundry at my mother. (Barney hand, then returned several hours later) Do you mind if I use your futon?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18222","Robin","There is no futon.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18223","Barney","Put it there, guys.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18224","Robin","What's the matter?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18225","Barney","It's on the list. ""Landing on the futon with a friend rather than going to the hotel. ""","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18226","Robin","I'm too old for this stuff.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18227","Ted","You got anything in your ear? It looks like the inside of a pumpkin after Halloween.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18228","Barney","What, this? Just a quick foul '. Just a kid like me has to worry about. Then, ""pushing a medical"" on the list. (His phone rings) Hold on. Bar here...","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18229","Marshall","It is not stop! You know, it's funny, I came to teach them... Do not stop running! All this time, it is they who have taught me things. (He throws the basketball on a kid) you not being there! You fall!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18230","Ted (2030)","The next morning, Barney woke up on the futon in the living room.","04","19","Murtaugh"

"18233","Barney","No, it's just the raver's hump. I like it. It brings me closer to my glass. A youth! (He can not drink his glass) You should have a straw?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18234","Robin","There's a side admirable in its way to remain young.Who wants to be old?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18235","Ted","This guy. Life is a meal and old age, the dessert. I get so many worries about the future. Where will my career? Who will I marry? When you're old, you do not worry, because all this has happened before. You got pumps and a comfortable seat for the stairs. That's perfect.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18236","Robin","It's not perfect, it's pathetic. You can not skip to the end.The best thing is the journey.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18237","Ted","I thought that, too, you'll understand when you grow older.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18238","Lily","Marshall, you can avoid the attack today?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18239","Marshall","I will not attack, Lily. I attack this pervasive culture of failure. I have to toughen them if you want to win the match tomorrow.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18240","Lily","Winning? There are no points.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18241","Marshall","What?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18242","Lily","There are no points.","04","19","Murtaugh"

"18247","Lily","Gender  joy joy!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18248","Lily","Because that's the point of playing, having fun.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18249","Marshall","The point of playing is to win the trophy. And if you do not know who wins, wins the trophy?","04","19","Murtaugh"

"18261","Robin","Your ear begins to feel.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18262","Barney","It's good.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18263","Ted","I hate to refuse, but you told me that the turkey was extremely thin, and see for yourself.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18264","Robin","Okay. It's good. You have your own list.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18265","Ted","What?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18266","Robin","A list of things that you are too young. Do all these things and tell me if you still want to be old.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18267","Ted","Removes ""colonoscopy"" and ""sleeping with an old"", and is a cinch.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18268","Barney","New bet, then. If you can finish your list before me, we will cover the laser PQ and you pay toilet paper.Biodegradable and not this crap. I want up there forever.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18269","Ted","Well, if I finished first, it's six hours of study of American architecture from the early 20th, and you can not ever do something in the list of Murtaugh. This is for your own good.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18270","Barney","Bet held.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18271","Robin","An agreement of honor!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18272","Lily","Marshall, they were in kindergarten. It teaches not basketball like that.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18273","Marshall","Sure. I learned that way.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18274","Lily","Are you kidding? What kind of sociopath told you like that?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18275","Marshall","Come on, Dad. I'm tired.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18276","Father","Sleep is for the winners. You go to bed when you get labeled.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18277","Marshall","I'm trying.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18278","Father","I give you two points for trying. But I take off two points because of your big head.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18279","Marshall","With my father, no mercy and I did not ask. I really need to call this guy. Continue stretching!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18280","Ted","""Put on reading glasses. ""Done. ""Yelled the boy from the neighborhood. ""With pleasure. (Ted was about to leave when Robin and Barney come but this box) What happened to you?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18281","Barney","I just had a little ""screw up my knee and it hurts"" incident.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18282","Ted","How did you do?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18283","Barney","It... ""Helped to move the sixth floor walk against pizza and beer.""","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18284","Robin","Or you helped steal the sixth floor. They were in a hurry and left the pictures.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18285","Ted","16 pm! Supper time.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18286","Lily","Your father was hard on you. It's ugly, but you do not have to be like him. You can learn from mistakes.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18287","Marshall","Errors? Lily, result. The guy was successful. He taught me to be a winner. This is what I teach these kids. And besides, this is what I will do with our children.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18288","Lily","OK, enough. This is not how we will raise our children!And that's not how you gonna lead this team! In tomorrow's game, if you're anything but a teddy bear with the cotton candy and rainbows, I foudroierai gaze so hard that you bruise! The times I've found your internet history, it was a mere side! Is that clear?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18289","Marshall","There are different...","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18290","Lily","Is that clear?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18291","Marshall","Yes, ma'am. What is ironic is that...","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18292","Barney","Ted Calls. I want to go.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18293","Robin","Okay. I call it. But it is 4 30 am. It will not be awakened.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18294","Ted","Got up at 4am... Done.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18295","Barney","It answers?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18296","Robin","I have not called yet.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18297","Barney","Hurry up, Robin.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18298","Ted","Okay. ""Take time to answer the phone. ""","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18299","Barney","Come on, Ted. I was given aspirin and I do not think it was.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18300","Ted","Done.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18301","Marshall","I know I was a little hard on you, the last two days.And I apologize. Today, we will not think of victory. We'll go there and... have fun.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18302","Ted (2030)","Children, over time your Uncle Marshall rehashed the story this game hundreds of times. And in fact, children from the other team were older than one class. But harping on the story, they looked like that.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18303","Marshall","Let them score easily. Now you're sitting. Great.Addison is not football. Do not shoot! Unless you find it funny, in this case, have fun though. It was not a foul, referee?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18304","Referee","I'm no referee, but Kenny. And watch your tone.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18305","Marshall","No tone, Kenny. Good job. Thank you very much.See you later.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18306","Robin","As a manager, I threw in the towel. This bet is over.Your ear looks like a Danish pastry in a French breakfast.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18307","Barney","No, he remains a. ""The beer funnel. ""","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18308","Ted","It happens. I found these weird Russian beers, in the basement.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18309","Robin","The Russian beer? I will take a bierofski. Bierofski. Got it?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18310","Ted","Yes, it's... a little hot. I hope this is not a problem.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18311","Barney","No, no. Okay. You won, I hate it. I hate it. My back is killing me. At the rave, I was mistaken for a cop. I have an earache so I can hear... I hear my own ear. Think about it. My clothes... What... Take that! I have redeemed you your best costume for twice its price. This is... $ 30. And throw the shoes. You won, Ted. I will not make anything of the Murtaugh list. I'm too old for this stuff.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18312","Ted","You know, yesterday I went to bed at 20h because it was on the list and I could not sleep... because it was 20h. So I watched Lethal Weapon.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18313","Ted","I still could not sleep, so I watched Lethal Weapon 2. And then 3. And in the middle of Lethal Weapon 4, I realized...","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18314","Ted","... that Murtaugh kept repeating  ""I'm too old for this stuff,"" but every time he says, he changes his mind, made another movie, and stuff. What I'm trying to say is that... the toilet, age.Will cover the PQ laser tag.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18315","Barney","And then the hospital.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18316","Marshall","Good job, guys. At least, there are no points, eh? No idea of the score. It could be 53-0. It could be something else.It's 53-0.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18317","Boy","What are we doing wrong, coach?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18318","Marshall","You do not do anything wrong. It's great that you lost, because in life, no matter the effort you make, or how much you try, people give you things. Since graduation, jobs, promotions. No matter what you do on the ground, as... As you're having fun.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18319","Ted (2030)","Because they did not want to argue in front of children, your uncle and your aunt Lily Marshall had a telepathic conversation.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18320","Lily","Do not look at me like that.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18321","Marshall","I take it anymore! Your coaching is crazy!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18322","Lily","Stop yelling at me!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18323","Marshall","I'm sorry. But is what I can do it my way?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18324","Lily","OK, but I'll do it my way too. With the guitar.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18325","Ted (2030)","Was it the determination of Marshall, Lily of encouragement, or the magic combination of both, but in the second half, the disorganized group of little urchins... have actually made things worse. In fact, according to Uncle Marshall, in the second half, the other team had even grown.And one of them had changed into a werewolf.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18326","Marshall","There is a werewolf on the ground! It can not be legit.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18327","Lily","They look different, the children, but make sure they feel surrounded.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18328","Marshall","It was not a market, right? You're killing me! You kill me outright!","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18329","Kenny","Attention, coach, or I put a technical foul.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18330","Marshall","I beg you to put me in one.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18331","Ted (2030)","When the final whistle sounded charitably, the score was, according to the estimate of Marshall, 118 to nothing. And even if they did not win, everyone, including the coach, received a trophy for participation.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18332","Lily","I understand that you like it not.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18333","Marshall","I love it. I worked hard. It's nice to be appreciated at its true value.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18334","Lily","I know, baby.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18335","Marshall","Your way is perhaps not completely stupid.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18336","Lily","Thank you. Yours is.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18337","McCracken","My great... you cause me problems since you joined this club. But damn... if this is not the best battle of PQ I've ever seen. You are returned... And right away.","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18338","Barney","Really?","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18339","McCracken","Good God, no! I call the police! Major cons with pink hair that dangle from the PQ. Are you kidding. I'm too old for this...","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18340","Ted (2030)","Stuff. He said ""Stuff"".","04","19","Murtaugh"
"18341","Barney","I heard a joke at work.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18342","Ted","Come on. She will not like it. It's funny for the guys, not girls.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18343","Barney","It's sexist! When it's funny, it's funny. Lily's cool. She'll love it.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18344","Marshall","Do it yourself.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18345","Lily","Tell it.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18346","Barney","Ready? What is the difference between jam and Nutella? (Marshall laughs) It's funny.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18347","Ted","For the guys.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18348","Marshall","She will not like it.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18349","Lily","Why do not I decide? What is the difference between jam and Nutella?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18350","Ted (2030)","Can Barney gave the fall. To date, it remains the most disgusting joke I have ever heard in my life. And no, I do not say.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18351","Lily","Yeah, I can not hang out with you.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18352","Barney","Come on. It's funny. This is...","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18353","Ted","I told you so.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18354","Barney","She'll be back.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18355","Ted (2030)","And we saw more Lily for 4 weeks.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18356","Ted (2030)","The children, after being fired, I finally realized my lifelong dream  to create my own architectural firm. I had just customers.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18357","Robin, out of the room","I think it's great that you fly with your own wings. I admire that.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18358","Ted","Thank you. And thank you for letting me use the apartment.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18359","Robin","Yeah, sure. Anything you want.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18360","Ted","A little thing, do you mind to cut off the TV during labor?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18361","Robin","It's not work!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18362","Ted","Sorry. It's just... I can not concentrate during the Wheel of Fortune... A penny saved is a penny, Helen!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18363","Robin","I know you're nervous, but we must stop procrastinating. You've spent two days to choose the pen official Mosbius Designs.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18364","Ted","I've suggested! I removed the felt. I make fun of that? The felt is back.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18365","Barney","You know for layoffs?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18366","Marshall","Yes, I know. I tag. Are you worried?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18367","Barney","Are you kidding? I know one thing about this company. I will never be fired. It is likely that one day I was stranded on a beach with no footprints or teeth, but I will not fire.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18368","Marshall","I would like to have your insurance.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18369","Barney","You just gotta find a way to make you absolutely critical.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18370","Marshall","I work harder than anyone in my division.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18371","Barney","Keep your job has nothing to do with being a hard worker. You need something.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18372","Marshall","What do you mean something?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18373","Barney","You know, something that makes you funny and loved, as Marcus Denisco.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18374","Ted (2030)","Marcus Denisco worked in accounting, and it was probably the worst employee of the box.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18375","Marcus","I brought donuts. They are probably stupid.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18376","Ted (2030)","But ultimately, it was called...","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18377","All","Chow-man!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18378","Marcus","Who wants pork barbecue? Of course you want!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18379","Marshall","I love Chow-man. They can not fire him. You know what I like about Chow-man?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18380","Barney","It's always food.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18381","Marshall","It's always food.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18382","Barney","You see? You need it. You need that thing that makes you a man.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18383","Marshall","I have this thing that makes me a guy. Maybe even a guy and a half.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18384","Barney","Not this stuff. You know, something. Toy-like man.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18385","Toy-Man","Bad news. As HR, I must review the new overtime policy with you. The good news is that we will do with Wolverine's claws! (They start to play all three) Section 5A  doing overtime will no longer be paid double.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18386","Marshall","That's great!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18387","Barney","Claw tape!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18388","Marshall","I love Toy-man.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18389","Barney","You see? You need something. Youtube-like man.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18390","Marshall","You're right. I need something.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18391","Barney","But choose wisely. You want to become the horrible man Massage.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18392","Barney","You filled it. Grub-man has a panna cotta in his office.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18393","Massage man, massaging the shoulders of Marshall","Hi, dude.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18394","Marshall","Hi, Douglas.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18395","Douglas","You're so tense.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18396","Marshall","I was relaxed, two seconds ago.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18397","Douglas, Barney","You're next.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18398","Man","Welcome to Mosbius Designs.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18399","Robin","Who are you?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18400","Man","PJ, the assistant of Mr. Mosby.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18401","Robin","What's going on?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18402","PJ","Sorry. You do not interrupt Mr. Mosby during his hours of reflection.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18403","Ted, by phone at PJ interposed","Good, PJ. This is Robin. She lives here.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18404","PJ","Sorry for the inconvenience, sir. You need something else?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18405","Ted","I would not refuse a cup of coffee.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18406","Robin","You're right next door!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18407","Robin","So now Ted is assisted to do nothing.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18408","Ted","PJ is a great help. Install the desktop, create the Web site. And in return, I guide a young brilliant mind.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18409","Robin","Yes, the guide.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18410","Ted","I want you to go out today and... put your hands on the buildings. Okay? Sense the vibrations of the concrete. Listen to the stories that you tell the stones. And going to the cleaners.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18411","Man","I will. Thank you very much, Mr. Mosby.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18412","Ted","All right.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18413","Robin","This table just told me that you're an idiot.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18414","Robin","This idea of being a guide is to procrastinate the fact of calling customers.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18415","Ted","I do not procrastinate. I just want everything to be perfect, right? I have only one test.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18416","Robin","Okay, but PJ does not help.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18417","Barney","If Ted says that PJ is necessary to society, then PJ will go nowhere.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18418","Ted","You see? It is useful.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18419","Barney","PJ is a guy? PJ, this is not a hottie you f*ck?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18420","Ted","No, I guide him.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18421","Barney","A Guide. I guided a young, once. I made him my co-pilot. Then one day, he hired an assistant to work 3 meters from her room, which... Check it out... is not a hottie, proving he has never listened. You know how to call this type?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18422","Ted","Ted Mosby?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18423","Barney","Maybe. I remember more. Because for me he is dead!(He rises) PJ will receive a mail with a disruptive place, it should in any circumstances be three days and then send it to me.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18424","Marshall","I thought of something to become indispensable.The Ecolo-man! Everyone loves recycling, eh?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18425","Barney","Fired. What else you got?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18426","Marshall","I have others. Ties-Fun-man.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18427","Barney","Fired.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18428","Marshall","Info-Unusual-man?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18429","Barney","Did you know? Whether you're fired?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18430","Marshall","Stretch-man?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18431","Barney","upside down Viré.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18432","Marshall","The Monty-Python-man?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18433","Barney","We are the knights who say... You're fired.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18434","Marshall","Wait! I ran a simulation league baseball in school.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18435","Barney","Not bad. You got maybe something.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18436","Marshall","Great! Great! I Simulates-man!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18437","Barney","Actually, you'll Sports-man. We have already Simulates-man.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18438","Man","OK, guys?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18439","Barney","Hi, Frank.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18440","Ted","Hello? Hello, PJ. Where are you? You're never late.You're mounted on the Empire State Building? Listen to the old lady. She knows stories. Take your time. (Hangs up) Wait.""Ted Mosby House."" The call comes from within! (He opens the bedroom door and discovered Robin in bed with PJ) This is not the Empire State Building. You can not sleep with my assistant. I try to work here, me. How did that happen?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18441","Robin","At noon, when you go to any walk of reflection, that leaves us time to spend together.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18442","Ted","Inspiration... do your work.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18443","PJ","Each time, chief. Every time.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18444","Robin","Tell me, PJ, I have a question for you architecture.Ted's ass what taste?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18445","PJ","No idea, but probably the taste of engineering.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18446","Robin","It's locked?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18447","PJ","Visitors must register for the key.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18448","Robin","Listen, PJ. And I want you to think seriously before answering. You tell me I can not go to the bathroom with me?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18449","PJ","I tell you that you must ask permission to use the toilet in my premises.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18450","Robin","Why does it excite me?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18451","Ted","There's billions of guys on Earth. Why do you sleep with him?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18452","Robin","When I leave the job, it is 5 30 am. Got an idea of guys I meet?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18453","Man","I distribute the newspaper, it's dirty but someone has to do. Do not worry, I wash them before you fiddle with the parties.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18454","Man","I live with my mom. In the evening they watch TV in bed.It's called ""The club hugs.""","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18455","Robin","So, you get up very early to discuss the European market? How is it?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18456","Man","Look, we'll do it or not?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18457","Ted","First, I know Simulates-man, this is a good match.Second, it must stop! If you distract PJ, you lose productivity.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18458","Robin","What productivity? You did not call a single customer.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18459","Ted","Once launched the website, printed brochures, and the choice of games at the business seminar, I will call.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18460","Robin","Seminar?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18461","PJ","Mr. Mosby and I are going camping on the roof.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18462","Barney","Sports-man. I heard people talking about your club.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18463","Marshall","It's a bit harder than I thought. Registration fees, transaction charges penalty, I... keeps a lot of money.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18464","Grub-man","Good job, Sport-man. That's last week.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18465","Marshall","60, 80, 100. $ 18 000 in cash. It's nothing. I'll bring it home and put them in a safe place. (Marshall is in the street) OK, walk down the street with money in his pocket. Not touch the money. It's so obvious. Be natural. The baby looks at me.Babies can smell money. It is known! I carry a lot of money!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18466","Marshall","Really, dude, I know not how long I'll keep.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18467","Barney","Last week you were a waste that nobody was looking.Now you're Sports-man.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18468","Marshall","A waste?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18469","Barney","Last week!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18470","Marshall","This is Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. How is the home office?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18471","Ted","Okay, until Robin sleeps with my assistant.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18472","Robin","This is our apartment. You let a cake on the counter, Mama's going to offer a slice.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18473","Barney","I've told you, commits a pretty assistant with whom you can sleep instead of hiring an assistant with whom Robin sleeps. Of course he'll sleep with her. It is the coolest on the planet. I am off topic! You're an idiot! This is my message!You're an idiot! An angry person, that's not enough! Marshall with me!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18474","Marshall","Dude, why are you so upset that Ted does not sleep with the people he hires?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18475","Barney","Because it hurts!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18476","Marshall","How so?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18477","Barney","It hurts because I love... when Ted... layer with women. I am a very devoted friend! Lily is the only one I can talk. Tell him to talk to me.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18478","Marshall","I'll try, but no warranty. She is still shocked by this joke. This joke. It tore our group, which turns the people I love against the other. Frankly, I would... I would like this joke is never entered our lives.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18479","Barney","It's funny anyway, right?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18480","Marshall","It's very funny.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18481","Ted","Good news, PJ. The brochures just arrived. Great choice for coverage. I like that instead of one of my creations, you to choose that.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18482","PJ","You know what? I had to send the wrong photo.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18483","Ted","You think so? Listen to PJ, the website is still not done.You're not even come to the seminar... In fact, I saw a shooting star... and you're late every day. Sorry, PJ. I must be concentrated. You're fired.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18484","PJ","You can not fire me...","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18485","Ted","You're fired.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18486","PJ","Well! (He takes his phone) Hi, baby, I've just been fired.Yes, I'll wait with you. (He settles on the couch and turn on the TV) The Wheel of Fortune.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18487","PJ","I like having all this time to spend with you book. I'll kiss you there... And there... And here and there. And...","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18488","Robin","One more.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18489","Ted","Stop.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18490","PJ","I'm going to the toilet. I'll miss you.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18491","Robin","I'll miss you too.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18492","Ted","You've already tired of him.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18493","Robin","It is driving me crazy. When PJ was working, he was sexy. The keeper of the key toilet. A sexy guy that says when you can go to the bathroom or not? It's the dream.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18494","Ted","""It's the dream""? The dream? As mentioned by Martin Luther King?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18495","Robin","I have to stop, right? I know not break.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18496","PJ","I still have to go, but I could no longer stay away from you.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18497","Robin","Listen... Dude, I know.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18498","PJ","What?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18499","Robin","Yes, it's just... It's not really... that, you know?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18500","PJ","It's on what?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18501","Robin","I feel it.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18502","PJ","Do you not feel anything?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18503","Robin","But friends and others.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18504","Ted","My God, this is the worst break.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18505","PJ","You're breaking up with me?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18506","Robin","If this is what you want, I totally understand.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18507","Toy-man","You do not use this short-stop that the Mariners have discussed. I must have.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18508","Barney","You see, Sports-man. People adore you.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18509","Marshall","I can be more Sports-man. I'm going crazy! I keep receiving text messages, emails and calls in the middle of the night. Sometimes I even think that I follow.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18510","Douglas","Hi, dude. We need you to do this exchange, I can prepare my team. You are really tight, is it not?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18511","Marshall","Seriously, it's over.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18512","Douglas","I stop?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18513","Marshall","No.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18514","Ted (2030)","With the breakdown of Robin and PJ, I was free to change the personnel office.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18515","PJ","Welcome Mosbius Designs.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18516","Robin","Are you kidding?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18517","Ted (2030)","Now that PJ came back to work...","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18518","Ted","Are you kidding?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18519","Marshall","Apparently, Robin and PJ are together again.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18520","Barney","You're kidding!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18521","Marshall","How are you?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18522","Barney","As Lily not speaking to me, I must tell you something.And it's not easy to say, OK? I... wait... 'm... wait... love...wait... of... wait... a... wait... some... wait...","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18523","Marshall","I know you're in love with Robin.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18524","Barney","What?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18525","Marshall","Lily told me.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18526","Barney","She told you? Great. I guess you marrez my back all this time.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18527","Marshall","Actually, oddly, we both think you're meant for each other.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18528","Barney","Really?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18529","Marshall","It even tries to sit on the same side for you to sit side by side.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18530","Barney","Really? This is so cute. But let's be clear. I do not like it, OK? It's just that... I miss when she is not there. I think about her all the time, I guess one day we will run towards each other in slow motion and I wear a suede jacket.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18531","Marshall","Tell her how you feel?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18532","Barney","No. Perhaps. Ever. I know not. Listen... I just need to get rid of that idiot PJ. If Lily was there, she would know how to get rid of him.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18533","Marshall","I can perhaps help you.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18534","Barney","You're not Lily. Lily is a diabolical puppet master, the subtle situations to achieve its ends. This is evil incarnate. You have the right. Cling to it.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18535","Ted (2030)","Meanwhile, I thank you without fight against Robin and PJ continued.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18536","Ted","I was going to do my walk with wisdom. Want to go?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18537","Robin","I took the key to the toilet without asking. Are you gonna do?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18538","PJ","Listen... you're great. But I chose another job. This is for you. Robin, I hope this letter will offer a conclusion. You will really miss.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18539","Chow-Man","Manny Ramirez is not exchange against two replacements!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18540","Toy-man","If you put your veto, I am going!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18541","PJ","I'll find something.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18542","Barney","Hire the kid as his assistant. He does all the work and you're still Sports-man. Evil incarnate, Eriksen. Evil incarnate.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18543","Robin","Are you okay?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18544","Ted","And if I did not think the books?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18545","Robin","Sorry?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18546","Ted","There is a history of architecture on a famous architect who designed the library. She was perfect. But every year, sinking a few inches into the ground. Obviously, the building was condemned. He forgot to take into account the weight of books. This box... it's just me. If I ever thought not to books?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18547","Robin","No one goes to the library, so you do not care of this type. And you must pick up the phone and call customers.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18548","Ted","The more I delayed the launch of my box, the more it can remain a dream and not something that I screwed up. It's like if I quit before it began.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18549","Robin","You wanna talk drop? I described as the perfect guy ""funny, intelligent, passionate, ambitious."" And apparently, I just... ""In my apartment."" You thought that you would have understood, now?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18550","Ted","Are you kidding? At 30, I had to have an insolent success, being married to the perfect woman, maybe a kid on the way. Instead, I'm just a guy sitting in his apartment, which is a competition look with his phone. And who loses.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18551","Robin","You can do it.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18552","Ted","Hello, Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. I learn about your design needs, present or future.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18553","Robin","It looks good.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18554","Ted","I looked confident?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18555","Robin","Now known as a real customer.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18556","Ted","Great.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18557","Marshall","Hey, Chow-man!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18558","Barney","Hey, Toy-man!","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18559","Marshall","Who's this guy?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18560","Barney","He is not here. I think we should leave.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18561","Marshall","Really?","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18562","Barney","It's happened before.","04","20","Mosbius Designs"
"18563","Ted","Super. So I'll call you.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18564","Woman","I hope so.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18565","Marshall","Look at this.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18566","Ted","I had the number of that girl. Look. Holly.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18567","Barney","Owl. The girls with a name ending in LY are dirty.Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18568","Marshall","Yeah, it's true.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18569","Barney","And not to mention the girls with names ending in I instead of a Y. These girls are like rides. You make the long tail, but once inside, you hold on, hoping not to lose your keys.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18570","Ted","You know what I'm going to do? I'll call on. I will do ""you remember me? It's been a "". It's funny because I just saw.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18571","Barney","You can not. You must wait three days before calling.This is the rule.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18572","Ted","This rule is completely outdated. They know exactly what you do. I have another rule. It's a bit crazy, but I call it, ""you like him, you call him.""","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18573","Barney","Sorry. Can you repeat that? I do not mean the I-fuck-ever.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18574","Ted","My rule of three days, it is anything. Who invented it?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18575","Barney","Jesus.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18576","Marshall","Barney, do not do that. Not with Jesus.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18577","Barney","Seriously. Jesus began this thing for three days. He waited three days to return to life. It was perfect. If he had waited one day we would not have known he was dead! They would have said  ""Jesus, are you? ""And Jesus would probably have said,"" You okay? I died yesterday! ""And they would say "" You have the air alive, man. "" And they should explain his resurrection. And the miracle. And then the guy would say, ""Okay, whatever you want, dude.""","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18578","Robin","The dialogues seem pompous old now.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18579","Barney","And he will not come back on a Saturday. Everyone is busy doing chores. Weave, cut the beard. No. It looked exactly the right number of days... Three.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18580","Ted","I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18581","Barney","And it's Sunday, they are all already in the church.They are all there, ""No, Jesus died."" Then, bam! He burst through the door, crossed the aisle, everyone is excited. And by the way, that's where he invented the ""tope there! ""3 days.We wait three days to call a woman because it is the time that Jesus wants us to wait. True story.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18582","Ted","Okay. I promise. I will call not before three days.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18583","Ted (2030)","But I said nothing about texting. I started with something pretty and charming. ""I thought about you, then, I thought you send a text message piti."" By pressing send, I realized that it was not at all charming. That was the thing that sucks the most anyone has told someone. And the worst with texting, is that once sent... can not recover them. And then...(23 minutes later...) you wait. And just when you decided to never again send a text message... (His phone rings) ""I thought you too, it's crazy that you send me a text when I'm in my bath.""","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18584","Robin","What was that?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18585","Ted","What?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18586","Robin","You made a noise.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18587","Ted","This is my laptop, a text message.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18588","Robin","Not that. You made the sound of the naked girl.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18589","Ted","What?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18590","Robin","When you see a naked girl, you make noise.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18591","Ted","That's not true.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18592","Robin","Really?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18593","Ted","Sorry, Lily.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18594","Voice","While the men hunt, women of the Korowai tribe native wash their clothes in the river.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18595","Ted","It's a breast.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18596","Robin","This is Holly who writes to you? You're not promised to wait three days?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18597","Ted","To call. Texting, it's different.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18598","Robin","Okay, just try to proclaim your sound of the naked girl.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18599","Ted","I make no noise.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18600","Robin","Really?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18601","Ted (2030)","Holly and I, we had sent text messages until 2am.And all the next day, too. It seemed perfect.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18602","Ted","Holly just told me what she wears. It's pretty exciting.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18603","Robin","Whatever it is, I guarantee you she do not wear it. She lies to please you.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18604","Ted","How do you know?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18605","Robin","Because no woman in history has never, ""asked to read architectural magazines in my old... uniform cheerleader. ""","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18606","Ted","Okay, maybe she's lying on the architectural magazines.No. This is bad.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18607","Robin","What?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18608","Ted","She just sent me a message clearly intended for someone else.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18609","Robin","""Baby, I got to eat at Generro. I come home soon. ""Yes, it sounds bad, but thinking a little. It is perhaps for his brother or father who is ill.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18610","Ted","Come down.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18611","Robin","""And then I want to... you to take me on the couch.""Maybe not a sick father. Father or a really sick... Right? Sorry.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18612","Robin","Hi guys! What is it?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18613","Marshall","A meal that I Generro back to Lily.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18614","Robin","Bizarre. Holly sent a message to Ted talking about a meal Generro. A second. Band of bastards!","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18615","Barney","What?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18616","Robin","You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18617","Barney","We knew he would try to call three days before, so I took his cell phone and changed his number from mine.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18618","Marshall","We wanted to call the chopper too early, but then he... sent text messages.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18619","Barney","""Piti texting""?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18620","Marshall","Poor, little Ted. It should... He should say it estnous.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18621","Barney","Yeah. Or... it pretends to Holly and we are in the bath.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18622","Marshall","It's better. It was funny. He should say that it is us.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18623","Barney","It should. Or... it is said that red is our favorite color and found the look ""cowboy"" sexy.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18624","Marshall","It's better.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18625","Ted","I wear them right now and they are very sexy.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18626","Barney","He put the boots!","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18627","Marshall","He bluntly put! It was great! But it's time to tell him that he wears.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18628","Barney","Or... we remove our shirts.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18629","Marshall","It's better.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18630","Barney","Maybe that door below, a black bra with lace.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18631","Marshall","I believe that wearing anything underneath.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18632","Barney","It is hot.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18633","Marshall","There, he wears only cowboy boots! Here we go!","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18634","Barney","Too! Tell him we slowly drag our... What do we do?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18635","Marshall","I think we'll... have s*x with Ted.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18636","Robin","You did this all day? This is wicked.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18637","Marshall","No, actually it was for his good. It protects it from itself. He really likes this girl. He had that look.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18638","Barney","The crazy eyes, ""I'm going too fast and I will f*ck up everything.""","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18639","Marshall","The same he had with you the first time.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18640","Barney","We all know what it gave.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18641","Ted","I'm in love with you.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18642","Robin","What?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18643","Robin","I was a single case. This is not Holly Robin Scherbatsky. What is wrong with her hair? News Flash  detangling, it exists for not having a helmet. I'm so mean.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18644","Marshall","It's been that Ted did not like someone. He stored much... We thought him to say ""I love you"" when he contacted her.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18645","Barney","And it's coming. It shows all the telltale signs.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18646","Marshall","First  he jokes with the marriage.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18647","Barney","""You like architecture? We should get married. Ha-ha.MDR. Just kidding. So what? ""","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18648","Marshall","Deuzio  it's far too early suggestions crazy travel.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18649","Barney","""I like beer. We should go to Germany. MDR. JP.MDR. ""","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18650","Marshall","Third  it says too early personal things.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18651","Barney","""My parents divorced two years there. It was really hard. MDR. ""","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18652","Robin","And he really knows not what means MDR.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18653","Marshall","Yeah, but that's the problem. Ted did not say ""I love you"" as easily as we thought.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18654","Barney","And then we met Stan.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18655","Stan","Why do you so much noise?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18656","Marshall","So, he explained everything and once finished, there was something fascinating.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18657","Stan","Why not say you know it's there, thinking of you, concerned about you, and you feel safe? Your fears, your past disappear. And that the only hope is the promise of a hug.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18658","Robin","Super Stan. Who is it?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18659","Barney","A guard who works nights.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18660","Marshall","He eats here every day.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18661","Barney","And he had not finished.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18662","Marshall","Far from it.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18663","Stan","I thank God for every mistake I made, because each of them told me the path that led me to you.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18664","Marshall","It's... really nice.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18665","Barney","No matter. It's OK.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18666","Holly","""And when, finally, we will be together, I want you to enlaces. ""","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18667","Stan","Hug me all night. Stroking my hair. Tell me I'm a woman and show me that you are a man. Until there is now. You and me... and now.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18668","Marshall","You want me to send it to Ted. I knew it.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18669","Holly","""I do not ask someone to explain the night. I wait and it envelops me. And you're like bread, light and shadow. ""","04","21","The Three Days Rule"

"18692","Ted","Wait. It was them all along? So Holly was not in his bath?Or sitting by the window, gazing at the stars thinking of me? Or on his couch cheerleader reading architecture magazines?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18693","Robin","I think they have done that. They were just at the bar.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18694","Ted","It's true.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18695","Robin","Yes, it was them.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18696","Ted","Incredible!","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18697","Robin","I know. You should tell them that you are not fooled.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18698","Ted","Or... I send them a text message that will really confuse them.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18699","Robin","I see. Why not  ""I have told anyone yet, but I only have three months to live""?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18700","Ted","Not bad. And  ""I killed a man with a shovel, and those feelings resurface""?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"

"18706","Barney","That's it, man. This is the ""I love you.""","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18707","Marshall","I would like Stan to be there.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"

"18713","Marshall","Dude, I'm his best friend.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18714","Barney","Okay, one  It has never been proven. Two  If anyone had any dreams about gays one of us would be on me! Finally, look at me. Now look at you. An octogenarian still in her closet would not be in this state.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18715","Marshall","That's the trick. I hug you, no. Who would not want to cuddle in this case, on Sunday morning? Wrapped in the quilt while it is raining, and there are muffins in the oven. I'm cuddly, bitch. You must do.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18716","Barney","I train every day. One thing we know about Ted is that he likes a nice body. This body would vibrate.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"

"18720","Marshall","And by ""me"", he means Marshall Eriksen, star of Ted's gay dreams.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18721","Robin","So what? So Ted has gay dreams about one of you. It's not as if he had three months to live. It would... Shocking, no?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18722","Marshall","Look at this guy. How is my best friend for 12 years?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18723","Ted","It's a bit weird, but... I had a strange dream yesterday. It's a bit embarrassing.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18724","Barney","You can tell us. This is a secure area.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18725","Marshall","Your feelings are quite natural.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18726","Ted","That's what happened.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18727","Ted (2030)","And I wasted half an hour of life of these bastards, tell them about this dream where I dine with my top 5 best architects.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18728","Ted","Then at the end of the meal, Frank Gehry addition to the slides and IM Pei said, ""Friend, tonight is your name I Paye.""Buckminster Fuller was almost choking. And I woke up.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18729","Marshall","That's it?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18730","Barney","No more dreams? Nothing disturbing or erotic?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18731","Marshall","OK, what do you say that. You know that someday in the future, machines will rebel?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18732","Ted","Of course.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18733","Marshall","So, the machines... killed everyone. And there are only you, me, and Barney. Who among us would you... you?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18734","Ted","And.. why should I ""make me"" one of you?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18735","Barney","Machines force you. They want to watch. That's how they erupt.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18736","Ted","It's hard. I imagine it would be... Holly. Robin told me everything. That's why I invented everything. Guys, here is Holly. And I have not waited for your precious three days to call. I knew where she was working so I found. Let me ask you? It was too early?","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18737","Holly","I loved that he called me right away. It's very romantic.And I do not assoies home to read architectural magazines uniformed cheerleader. I do it naked.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"

"18739","Holly","I'll meet you outside.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18740","Marshall","Sorry. It was just trying to help you.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18741","Barney","And also, it was really funny.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18742","Ted","I do not need help, OK? I can look after myself. And yes, maybe some girls do not like to be called away or they may say too, but guess what? These are not good for me. Maybe the good is the one that loves me to do that, because... this is who I am and I will not change because of a stupid rule of the Three Days. Holly spells his name with an ""I"".","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18743","Ted (2030)","I had proved that the Rule of Three Days was wrong and I went out to dinner with a pretty girl. And so far, I have told anyone the truth about this hot date.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18744","Holly","It's funny! I also love indie music. We should get married. I laugh. Or not? I laugh again. That's it. We go to Brazil together! I saw my doctor this morning, he told me that everything was settled, so I can go. I think I love you.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18745","Ted (2030)","Finally, I did not have to wait three days, but Holly should really have. Like many rules, sometimes you follow them and sometimes not. But I will say this. When I was your mother's number, I called immediately.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"
"18746","Stan","Hi, friends.","04","21","The Three Days Rule"

A two-story Stetson... with a terrace on the edge. It's a cosmic joke. The universe conspires against me.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18769","Robin","Did you just need to get out. Take a walk. Pay yourself a bagel.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"

The greatest moments in life, it is not always what you do. This is also what happens to us. I'm not saying you can not influence the course of your life. You must act and you will. But remember that one day you could put one foot out and see your life changed forever. (He gives money to a homeless man) You know, the universe has a plan, children, and that plan is still moving. A butterfly flaps its wings... and it starts raining. (He opens his umbrella) It's scary. But it is also wonderful. All these workings of the machine running constantly, ensuring that you are exactly where you should be, exactly when you should be. The right place...

"18861","Barney","It's done. 199 made of, more than one. Have you finished your drink? (He takes the ice in the glass of Ted and puts them under the table) That's better.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18862","Ted","It has happened to you what?","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18863","Barney","There... a girl in the gym. Pauline. She runs after me for a while.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18864","Ted","Why wait till then?","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18865","Barney","It's not really my type.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"

"18872","Robin","You did the right Gaby Allan counted 2 times, but...you're also spent 138 to 138. Have you used the same number twice.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18873","Barney","So that means... Pauline is not the 199th, it is the 200th?","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18874","Ted","Congratulations!","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18875","Barney","It must have Petra! Petra was to be the 200th!Beautiful, feminine, ""unrestrained power in bed"", Petra!","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18876","Ted","Go! Happened to you at 200. You should be proud. You should be tested, but you should be proud. We do not care if Pauline does not pose in bikinis in magazines.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18877","Barney","It does. She will be in the next Muscle Sexxy. And like many women in this magazine, Sexxy has two X and one Y.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18878","Ted (2030)","So, bagel on the way, I stopped a minute in a booth to see the photo of the 200th Barney. If I had not done that, I would have missed the cut by the booth and came 77th in this corner a minute earlier. I would have had the bagel, worked a little, and you children, you would not be born. Why I cut through the 77th and gave a dollar to the homeless? That's why. In the early days of Marshall to Goliath National Bank...","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18879","Marshall","Fran, I will not bother you, but I have a presentation tomorrow and it would help me if I could have tables and graphs. Can you help me?","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18880","Fran","This is the graphics department. We can make all the graphs, tables, in all colors on the paper you want.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18881","Marshall","We'll have fun. (At the bar...) I ranked the presidents in order of disloyalty. A  Johnson. Two  Bush. Three Harding.Four  Polk. (At the apartment...) This circle represents ""Those who break my heart."" And this circle represents ""Those who constantly undermine my confidence. ""And where they meet  Cecilia. (Back at the bar...) This is a pie chart describing my favorite bars.

"18882","Robin","That's enough tables.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18883","Barney","What about the graphics.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18884","Ted","Any visual representation of data.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18885","Marshall","I'm not stupid. I know what you think of my paintings and graphics. In fact, I made a picture of your reactions to my paintings. See it. Yes, that's true, since Cecilia, your interest in my paintings do not stop falling. But based on recent trends, I also... projection boards! And look... a large peak of interest is coming! And it's not just a blip dead cat. It is a long-term growth.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18886","Barney","It's you, sustained growth.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18887","Marshall","So, I prepared some charts to show how the setting up of a shell company in Bermuda could minimize our losses in the second quarter. And you avoid jail. To begin with...Excuse me a moment?","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"

"18890","Ted","They were thrown.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18891","Marshall","What?","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18892","Ted","That's an intervention. You could not stop eating, so we threw your cam.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18893","Marshall","Come on, Ted! I need my pictures! Only for today and I promise to never ever do. I suffered a lot of pressure. I need my paintings, Jack!","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18894","Ted","You make tables work?","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18895","Marshall","It's for work, idiot! I make a great show and if I have not these pictures, I'm gonna get fired!","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"

"18897","Marshall","Magne! I will research how to wait. (Marshall back in the room) Sorry, there is a little late with the tables. But we'll begin in a moment. Fish are weird, right? I mean, what's their problem?","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18898","Voice","Tables! Buy your tables!","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"

"18902","Milt","Good thing they are selling.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18903","Ted","Okay, how?","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18904","Milt","One million.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18905","Ted","I give you five dollars.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18906","Milt","One million.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"

"18916","Ted (2030)","If I had not bought these tables for Marshall, I would not be passed by the 77th to give Milt his dollar. In short, you know the rest. And now, children. There are lots of little reasons that great things happen to us. If I knew then that these things take me and how I shall be grateful to them, I probably would have done something like that.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18917","Ted (2030)","The next day, Uncle Barney finally confronted Matthew Panning, the stud of the school of Port Richmond.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18918","Barney","I slept with 200 women.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18919","Matthew","My God! This is too much. Finally... It's disgusting.Have you thought of consulting as a s*x addict? You're the perfect candidate.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"
"18920","Barney","You've thought of consulting as ""I win, you lose""?Suddenly, your 100 girls in fifth, it is so impressive.","04","22","Right Place, Right Time"

"18929","Ted (2030)","Children, Stella was the girl I thought to end my life. Before she left me on the altar, breaking my heart. So, when I cross seven months later, I had only one thing to say.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18930","Ted","Stella! Glad to see you again!","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18931","Stella","I do too.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18932","Ted","And Tony! What a nice surprise.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18933","Robin","""What a nice surprise""? No, a nice surprise would have been a safe falls from 40 stories e crushes them both. You let yourself do?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18934","Ted","We had a friendly discussion and we resumed our respective paths.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18935","Robin","You're f*cked up. He f*cked up, right?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18936","Barney","Well played, sir.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18937","Marshall","Well done.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18938","Robin","What?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18939","Marshall","You know, Ted has played cool, that's exactly what he should do. In fact, I would say on a scale of...","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18940","Ted, crying","And I kept your sweater... and sometimes, I sit in the bathtub for hours, you know, feel it.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18941","Marshall","... up...","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18942","Ted, with a lookalike Stella","It's my new bride. This is Stella, except that it is French and, as you see, she has enormous breasts.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18943","Lookalike Stella","Magic.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18944","Tony","Enchanted.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18945","Marshall","I think you've been great.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18946","Barney","I would say even more. You, sir, did think Stella. ""Ted looked so cool now. Do I chose the wrong? ""Wait a week. The bush on the back. And belly. Have you felt that? There was an earthquake ""Tope-there"".","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18947","Ted","I am not on the back. Or stomach. I want to move forward.And it was an important step towards that. The future.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18948","Ted (2030)","And you know, I meant it. But anyway, that night, my mind wandered.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18949","Stella","I made a terrible mistake.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18950","Ted","I know. I'm better than you.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18951","Stella","Bluntly. Ressortons lie down together and much more.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18952","Ted","Sold!","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18953","Tony","Hi, Ted.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18954","Ted","No, between. It's not weird at all.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18955","Tony","I knew it was wrong to steal someone's girlfriend. I got used to it. I could not sleep. And for the wrong reasons.Sometimes for good reasons. Stella and I, we had not seen for five years, so you can imagine, at first it was fast and intense.Broken lamps, furniture moved. You see this bald area?Regardless, we turned the page. Me, Lucy, Stella, we would be moving to LA I was going to become a screenwriter. Then, you have been crossed, and you looked so... sad.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18956","Ted","Sad? No. I think what you call sorrow was only... jovial nonchalance.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18957","Tony","You're wrong, OK? As a small dachshund with back pain who should be walking in a bag.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18958","Ted","Why are you here?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18959","Tony","I know I can be a bit harsh, but I can not bear to have you as many wounded. Fate put me in the street to fix it.Obviously, I can not fill the crater left by Stella in your heart.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18960","Ted","I met lots of girls.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18961","Tony","And I know you've been fired.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18962","Ted","I switched to running a small business. This is the lung of the economy.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18963","Tony","No. Ted, my family has a lot of money. And I want to use that money to fix it with you.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18964","Marshall","Tony is rich? Tell me that you wrote a check. Tell me that you did a very big check. So big that he not remove his shirt to go swimming.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18965","Barney","It's a very big check. IF big, that if you sleep with, you would not tell your friends.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18966","Marshall","It's a very big check.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18967","Robin","So big, that when you sit next to on the plane, you wonder if the check would not have had to buy two seats.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18968","Marshall","It's...","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18969","Barney","A very big check!","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18970","Ted","Yeah! He has not signed a check.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18971","Tony","Ted, I want to offer you a job.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18972","Ted","A job?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18973","Tony","Every year, my family gives a lot to Columbia University, I have contacts. How would you like to design...","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18974","Ted (2030)","My heart jumped. A new library? A conservatory?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18975","Tony","... your own resume as professor of architecture.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18976","Ted","No thank you.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18977","Marshall","What do you mean ""no thank you""? You'd be a great teacher. You are an expert, you can talk, and when necessary, you can get to grow a beautiful beard.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18978","Ted","I will not be a professor. That's what you do when your career is in trouble and you have to pay the bills. Manager of small business. The lung of the economy. I will not take this job, okay? I'll get through. New topic.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18979","Barney","Okay. Today, I had a $ 200 fine for speeding.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18980","Marshall","That sucks, dude. You did not manage to blow it up?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18981","Barney","You can not blow a fine.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18982","Marshall","I have done. It was... when? In 1998.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18983","Policeman","Where's the fire?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18984","Marshall","There is no fire. In fact, you know, there's a fire in the barbecue where I go. Nothing special. Burgers, chops...merguez.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18985","Policeman","You know it's dangerous to go... You said ""sausages""?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18986","Marshall","Yeah, merguez. My mother's marinated in beer for 2 days. That's it. It's weird, I could have sworn that what those big, succulent smoked sausages had writing on it. Bizarre.You were saying?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18987","Policeman","That was writing what? The merguez?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18988","Marshall","It said  ""Ownership of Minnesota police, Jorgensen.""You like merguez, Jorgensen agent?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18989","Policeman","You go to this address? Follow me with the siren.It will burn red lights.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18990","Barney","I would have done that too, if I went to a barbecue.Slim, I went there.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18991","Marshall","It's all in the assessment of your enemy. I knew he loved the sausages because he was out of breath just by coming to my car and he had mustard on his holster.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18992","Robin","Handling a police officer with your sausage. It's sexy.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18993","Barney","You think I can not blow a fine? You think I can not blow my fine? I am Barney Stinson, master of manipulation. If I managed to make me pay for a stripper to dance, I can blow a fine. Challenge accepted... wait.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18994","Ted","I understand. ""Ack-Ted. ""I understood.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18995","Ted","What now?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18996","Tony","You wanna be an architect? Super. A guy I was in school wants a new home. The job is yours if you want.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18997","Ted","Tony, I do not need your help.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18998","Tony","That's his job.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"18999","Ted","Now that's a very big check.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19000","Barney","Let's go.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19001","Police","Driver and vehicle registration.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19002","Barney","Of course, officer. On.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19003","Policeman","Sir, this is a gift certificate for a custom Italian suit.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19004","Barney","So, what's good?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19005","Barney","$ 375! And he kept the gift certificate. Emilio and I'll call him tell him to shorten the crotch.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19006","Robin","You're wrong about that, man.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19007","Barney","Anything, Robin. Like you've already blown a fine.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19008","Marshall","Are you kidding? Robin is a pretty girl. They have no fines. I bet she was often stopped and has never had.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19009","Robin","This is outrageous! And relevant.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19010","Policeman","Permits and... Sweetie. No, do not cry. OK, not fine for you. Drive slower next time, OK?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19011","Robin","Thank you.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19012","Barney","Excuse me. I left something in New Jersey.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19013","Robin","How was your lunch with the rich? It started well.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19014","Ted","I want to design a home that showcases the landscape without dominating. IN 1935, when Frank Lloyd Wright designed the house to the waterfall...","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19015","Man","Yes, that's fine. You will do a good job. My concern is the basement. Especially the laundry.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19016","Ted","The laundry room?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19017","Man","I want a laundry room of 5 x 5 meters, ceramic tiles stain-resistant floor to ceiling. I am a man who likes to do his own laundry, and sometimes it's messy.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19018","Marshall","Gruesome?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19019","Ted","Gruesome.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19020","Man","steel chains hanging from the ceiling 3 meters. This is where my bags of laundry will be hung for three days and three nights before I... cleans.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19021","Robin","Ted, it looks like this guy asks you to design...","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19022","Ted","A deadly house.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19023","Robin","That's it. A house of horror.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19024","Tony","By practicing martial arts, I learned to believe in my instinct and my instinct tells me that... it sounds great.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19025","Ted","The steak is very rare.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19026","Ted","Do not you?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19027","Man","One last point, soundproofing. I tend to make much noise when I wash. I'll show you. I'll go in the laundry room and tell me if you hear me.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19028","Ted","It's a bit serious, huh?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19029","Tony","Grave well. You hit the nail.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19030","Robin","You can not do this house!","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19031","Ted","I will not do.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19032","Marshall","You can not do it!","04","23","As Fast as She Can"

"19038","Ted","Stop! I do not want your help, OK? You did not do that.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19039","Tony","Yes","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19040","Ted","Why?","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19041","Tony","Because... when you were with Stella, I missed her terribly. I can imagine how you feel.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19042","Ted","Let me reassure you. I do not want to Stella. She lied to me, dumped me at the altar. Who can do that? I'm better off without her. It is all yours, buddy.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19043","Tony","Okay. A weight less.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"
"19044","Ted (2030)","And that was all. Tony is gone and I started to put it all behind me. Finally, I thought.","04","23","As Fast as She Can"

"19664","Jen","Huh. I had no idea.","05","02","Double Date"
"19665","Ted","This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. 'Cause let's be honest, we are scaring people off, Jen.","05","02","Double Date"

"19709","Barney","And, Lil,Marshall shouldn't have to go to so much trouble just to have an innocent fantasy.","05","02","Double Date"
"19710","Lily","Trouble? What trouble?","05","02","Double Date"
"19711","Marshall","It's, no, it's nothing.","05","02","Double Date"
"19712","Barney","Marshall, tell her. We're all friends here.","05","02","Double Date"
"19713","Robin","No, we're not.","05","02","Double Date"
"19714","Marshall","Lily, Sometimes I think about other women. Okay, it happens. But even when I do, I feel so guilty that I have to imagine you... passing away first, because even in a fantasy world, I could never cheat on you. You're... you're just my life, baby. And I love you.","05","02","Double Date"
"19715","Lily","You kill me off?! I mean, fantasize about other girls all you want, but could you maybe not murder me?!","05","02","Double Date"
"19716","Marshall","Murder?! No! I, baby-no. You develop a chronic illness! I spare no expense for your care! I even stand up a foundation in your name. We're, like, this close to a cure.","05","02","Double Date"
"19717","Ted","Remember? (showing the Mc Laren's bar)","05","02","Double Date"
"19718","Jen","Oh, yeah! I do remember. We went in here for a drink with your friends. Who I loved... Or hated, depending on whether you're still friends with them.","05","02","Double Date"
"19719","Ted","You loved them.","05","02","Double Date"
"19720","Jen","They're family, Ted.","05","02","Double Date"
"19721","Ted","Let's go in and see what they remember. And they are my best friends, so don't be surprised if they suddenly ""can't think"" of anything I do wrong.","05","02","Double Date"
"19722","Robin","Did he juggle? Bad puns? Mmm. Expect a standing ovation for picking up a $19 check","05","02","Double Date"
"19723","Lily","Oh, let's not forget the menu typo gold mine. Keep pannin' that river, buddy.","05","02","Double Date"
"19724","Marshall","Well, it is a lot cheaper than buying a condom. Oh!","05","02","Double Date"
"19725","Jen","Actually you know what it was? I remember him coming across as kind of a player.","05","02","Double Date"
"19726","Ted","Me?","05","02","Double Date"
"19727","All the other","Ted?","05","02","Double Date"
"19728","Jen","Yeah. We were all sitting over there... (showing a table)","05","02","Double Date"
"19729","Jen","And here's a picture of my cats dressed up like Batman villains. You got the Joker, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze...","05","02","Double Date"
"19730","Lily","What about Cat Woman?","05","02","Double Date"
"19731","Jen","Yeah, that would've been good.","05","02","Double Date"
"19732","Barney","Psst! Ted! (showing a girl with his head)","05","02","Double Date"
"19733","Ted","(looking at the girl) Nice.","05","02","Double Date"
"19734","Ted","Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! I remember that. I was not checking out a girl.","05","02","Double Date"
"19735","Ted","Nice.","05","02","Double Date"
"19736","Ted","We were checking out Moustache Marshall.","05","02","Double Date"
"19737","The other","Ah...","05","02","Double Date"
"19738","Jen","Gosh, I thought you were such a jerk. I'm so sorry.","05","02","Double Date"
"19739","Ted","Yeah, well, it's nice to know ""past me"" wasn't a total jackass, huh?","05","02","Double Date"
"19740","Jen","""Present you"" isn't so bad, either.","05","02","Double Date"
"19741","Jen","Thank you very much.","05","02","Double Date"
"19742","Ted","You got it.","05","02","Double Date"
"19743","Jen","Yes. Oh, yeah! I remember this.","05","02","Double Date"
"19744","Ted","...and there's theChryslerBuilding. And the Empire State Building. And at 12 00, a rotund couple going at it against the glass.","05","02","Double Date"
"19745","Jen","Aww... That's kind of sweet. Oh, look. Snack break.","05","02","Double Date"
"19746","Ted","Good for them. Letting a guy eat pizza off your back, that's love. So, um... I know this wasn't the best","05","02","Double Date"
"19747","Jen","Me, too.","05","02","Double Date"
"19748","Ted","That was really great. Wh... What went wrong?","05","02","Double Date"
"19749","Jen","I remember now.","05","02","Double Date"
"19750","Jen","(after the kiss) Wow.","05","02","Double Date"
"19751","Ted","Yeah. So would you maybe, um... want to go out again?","05","02","Double Date"
"19752","Jen","Yeah, I, I would. Will you call me?","05","02","Double Date"
"19753","Ted","Absolutely.","05","02","Double Date"
"19754","Jen","Promise?","05","02","Double Date"
"19755","Ted","Promise.","05","02","Double Date"
"19756","Ted","I have been so busy.","05","02","Double Date"
"19757","Jen","Good night, Ted.","05","02","Double Date"
"19758","Jen","Hello?","05","02","Double Date"
"19759","Ted","Jen, I sorry. Look, I know I'm seven years late with this call, but I was an idiot back then. You saw the goatee. The truth is, I had a great time tonight, and I'd love to see you again.","05","02","Double Date"
"19760","Jen","Ted, there are two kinds of guys. The guys that you want to call you, who don't; and the guys you don't want to call you, who always do. And somehow, right now, you're both.","05","02","Double Date"
"19761","Lily","Baby... You should be able to fantasize about another woman without feeling guilty, or you know, killing me off.","05","02","Double Date"
"19762","Marhsall","I wish that I could, but I've been doing this for so long, I'm all confused about death and s*x. It's gotten to the pot where every time I drive past a cemetery, I'm sportin' a partial.","05","02","Double Date"
"19763","Lily","All right, we got to fix this.","05","02","Double Date"
"19764","Lily","Okay, when Stripper Lily gets out here, you have my permission to fantasize about her. And since she's basically me, maybe you won't feel guilty.","05","02","Double Date"
"19765","Marshall","Thanks, baby. I'm-I'm so lucky I have you. And stripper you.","05","02","Double Date"
"19766","Lily","Bring out Stripper Lily!","05","02","Double Date"
"19767","Barney","(to Robin) You know, I don't come here that much.","05","02","Double Date"
"19768","Waitress","Hey, Barney. He's the usual and I'll send over the other usual as soon as she's done stretching.","05","02","Double Date"
"19769","Barney","Thank you, kindly stranger.","05","02","Double Date"
"19770","Voice","Ladies and gentlemen... Oh, hey, Barney. Didn't see you come in. I'll load up some AC/DC for you, buddy. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for J-J-Jasmine.","05","02","Double Date"
"19771","Lily","I am hot! Oh, crawl for it, stripper me.I is awesome. Baby, can I get another hundred?","05","02","Double Date"
"19772","Marshall","That was a hundred?","05","02","Double Date"
"19773","Lily","Wow, she crawls fast.","05","02","Double Date"
"19774","Ted","Look, Jen, I wish I could go back and talk some sense into 2002 Ted, but that guy's a lost cause. He's 24. He thinks a little facial hair makes him look like John Depp. And he has no idea what a great girl he's missing out on. But I've learned a lot since then. I've learned a lot tonight.","05","02","Double Date"
"19775","Jen","The only thing that we've learned is that, seven years ago, it was mistake for us to go out. And I guess it was a mistake for us to go out tonight.","05","02","Double Date"
"19776","Ted","No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently... who knows what","05","02","Double Date"
"19777","Ted imagines","She wants to pay the restaurant. He offers her his jacket. They takes pictures with Moustache Marshall. He calls her after their date. They marry.","05","02","Double Date"
"19778","Jen","Wow.","05","02","Double Date"
"19779","Marshall","Wow.","05","02","Double Date"
"19780","Barney","You are the best. My girlfriend is at a strip club with me and she couldn't care less.","05","02","Double Date"
"19781","Robin","I do care, Barney. Look, we're dating now, okay? That changes things. We have to have a serious talk about this.","05","02","Double Date"
"19782","Barney","Just the best.","05","02","Double Date"
"19783","Marshall","Hey. Girlfriend trouble? I wish I could help, but my unbelievably cool wife just bought us a private dance with her stripper body double. So if you need me, I'll be getting grinded like some pepper, in theChampagne room.","05","02","Double Date"
"19784","Barney","Just the best.","05","02","Double Date"
"19785","Jen","... now what?","05","02","Double Date"
"19786","Ted","I just remembered why I didn't call you.","05","02","Double Date"
"19787","Jen","Why?","05","02","Double Date"
"19788","Ted","I can't believe I'm gonna screw this up again, but, um... I like finding typos in menus.","05","02","Double Date"
"19789","Jen","What?","05","02","Double Date"
"19790","Ted","And I know my shellfish pun is stupid but the truth... I'm not suddenly gonna stop making stupid jokes.","05","02","Double Date"
"19791","Jen","Now that you mention it... I'm never going to stop talking about my cats. They're funny and adorable and totally worth having to take six Benadryl a day.","05","02","Double Date"
"19792","Ted","Shouldn't we hold out for the person who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks, but actually kind of likes them? Even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other, seven years from now?","05","02","Double Date"
"19793","Jen","Oh, dear God, I hope that doesn't happen.","05","02","Double Date"
"19794","Ted","Well... good luck out there, Jen.","05","02","Double Date"
"19795","Jen","You too, Ted. You'll find your shellfish lady.","05","02","Double Date"
"19796","Ted (2030)","And kids, when I told your mother that shellfish joke, she did laugh. And I swear, it was only, like, 30% pity.","05","02","Double Date"
"19797","Marshall","Hey, Lil. Looks like, uh, Jasmine's having a hard time getting out of those boots.","05","02","Double Date"
"19798","Lily","(smoking and looking weird) What did you say, buddy?","05","02","Double Date"
"19799","Marshall","Lily?","05","02","Double Date"
"19800","Lily","Who? Oh, yes... I am this Lily. We married long time. May I have monies for shopping?","05","02","Double Date"
"19801","Marshall","(going on the stage) Lily!","05","02","Double Date"
"19802","Ted (2030)","Kids, your uncle Barney had been called a lot of names over the years.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19803","Girl 1","(throwing her glass to his face) Jerk!","05","03","Robin 101"
"19804","Girl 2","(throwing her glass to his face) b*st*rd!","05","03","Robin 101"
"19805","Girl 3","Barack Obama Jr.?!","05","03","Robin 101"
"19806","Barney","Mm-hmm. And yes... we can.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19807","Ted (2030)","But there's one name none of us ever expected to hear him called.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19808","Robin","Boyfriend. Barney Stinson is my boyfriend. I've said it, like, a hundred times it still sounds weird to say.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19809","Ted","Well, anything sounds weird if you say it a hundred times. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19810","Lily","But other than that, things are good?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19811","Ted","Bowl. Bowl.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19812","Robin","I don't know. I think Barney's been single for too long.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19813","Ted","Bowl.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19814","Robin","Like, the other night, I wake up at 4 00 a.m","05","03","Robin 101"
"19815","Ted","Bowl.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19816","Robin","Barney, are you awake? Barney?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19817","Robin","Barney. This is not a one-night stand. We're dating. Come back to bed.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19818","Ted","Bowl.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19819","Robin","That's happened three times.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19820","Ted","Bowl.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19821","Robin","And it's not just that, it's other things.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19822","Barney","Hey. What's wrong?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19823","Robin","(crying) It was just one thing after another at work today, and then... (sniffling) I found out my aunt's in the hospital. I'm just, I'm feeling so overwhelmed and it's just...","05","03","Robin 101"
"19824","Barney","Shh, shh, shh. What you need to do is talk through this stuff.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19825","Robin","Oh, thanks.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19826","Barney","And then, once you're off the phone with Lily, I'll be down in the bar ready to have s*x. Mm-kay?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19827","Ted","Bowl.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19828","Robin","Look, I'm not the touchy-feely-est person in the world, but... a little more effort would be nice.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19829","Ted","Bowl. Bowl.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19830","Robin","I understand.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19831","Ted","Bowl.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19832","Lily","I guess, in a lot of ways, Barney doesn't stack up.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19833","Ted","Bowl. Bowl.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19834","Lily","I mean, you've had some pretty incredible boyfriends.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19835","Ted","(at various pitches) Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19836","Robin","No, that's not it.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19837","Ted","Bowl.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19838","Robin","I don't know.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19839","Ted","Bowl","05","03","Robin 101"
"19840","Robin","Maybe he just doesn't have it in him.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19841","Ted","Bowl. Bowl.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19842","Robin","Maybe is whole thing's a big mistake.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19843","Ted","Bowl?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19844","Barney","She really said that?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19845","Ted","And she meant it. Trust me. I dated Robin for a year-- if you don't want to lose her, you gotta try a little harder. Be more attentive to where she is emotionally. You know, just be present.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19846","Barney","Yes, totally. Yeah. Only thing, and this is just me--","05","03","Robin 101"
"19847","Ted","Mm-hmm.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19848","Barney","I like my testicles attached to my body, rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!","05","03","Robin 101"
"19849","Ted (2030)","But then a funny thing happened. Over the next couple weeks, Barney was thoughtful, considerate, sweet. In short, the perfect boyfriend. Which, to Robin, meant only one thing.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19850","Robin","He's cheating on me.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19851","Lily","What?!","05","03","Robin 101"
"19852","Robin","Why else would he buy me flowers? He's gettin' some on the side.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19853","Lily","Oh, come on, Robin. Barney's not the type of guy who would... Go on.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19854","Robin","Plus, he keeps saying he's working late. But when I call his office, they say he left hours ago.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19855","Lily","Well, that doesn't prove anything.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19856","Robin","Yes. Proof. Go word. I'm glad you brought that up. Barney's briefcase. He forgot it here this morning. (taking Barney's briefcase).","05","03","Robin 101"
"19857","Lily","And what do you plan on doing with it?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19858","Robin","We, we-- you and I-- are going to open it up and look for evidence. Ted probably has a sledgehammer around here somewhere.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19859","Lily","No! Stop! Stop! Eye contact. Listen to me. Robin Scherbatsky is many things  friend, confidant, occasional guest star in some confusing dreams that remind me a woman's sexuality is a moving target. But she is no crazy, jealous stalker-bitch. (snatching the briefcase) Let go.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19860","Marshall","Hey, I've been down in the basement storage area going through all the stuff that Lily and I left behind when we moved out. I'm Robin. We should've cleared it out for you much sooner.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19861","Robin","There's a basement storage area?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19862","Marshall","Oh, you're not upset. Good. Baby, guess what I found.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19863","Lily","Oh, that's great, honey.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19864","Robin","What the hell is that?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19865","Lily","Marshall got it in college. He used it as a nightstand for years.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19866","Marshall","Until we found out that Lily was allergic to barrel resin","05","03","Robin 101"
"19867","Robin","(slowly) Barrel resin?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19868","Lily","Just go with it.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19869","Robin","So you need a hand throwing it out?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19870","Marshall","No, I'm not... I'm not just going to throw her out, okay? Mabel's like family.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19871","Robin","So, um, what are you gonna do with Mabel?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19872","Marshall","I want to give her away, um, to a lucky new owner. Do you know anyone?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19873","Robin","Yeah, hmm, let me think. Do I know any rodeo clowns? Oh, that's weird, I do. But even Lenny wouldn't go near that mess.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19874","Marshall","Well, he's not going to have the chance, because I am putting old Mabel in the Bermuda Triangle.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19875","Ted ( 2030)","The Bermuda Triangle was the name we'd given years earlier to the curb right in front of our building. Whenever we wanted to give something away, we'd put it right there. It was uncanny.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19876","Marshall","This is so exciting. Right now there's some out there who has no idea that tonight they're going home with just... just the best barrel.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19877","Robin","Well, let's just hope they're not allergic to barrel sin like Lily here.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19878","Lily","(to Robin) Be cool, baby. Damn! (toMarshall who is leaving with his barrel) See you, sweetie. Good luck.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19879","Marshall","Bye, babe.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19880","Lily","Now, can we please get out of here?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19881","Robin","Yeah. I'll grab my coat.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19882","Robin","Oops.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19883","Lily","A college notebook?!","05","03","Robin 101"
"19884","Robin","Oh, my God, he's cheating on me with some college girl. I knew there was a skank but I thought she'd at least be dumb.(reading the notebook) ""Birthday  July 23.Favorite hockey team  the Vancouver Canucks. Age  29, but tells people that she's 26."" Oh, my God,these are notes about me. Or some 29-year-old version of me.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19885","Marshall","I hope I'm not too late! I want to see the look of joy on the new owner's face!","05","03","Robin 101"
"19886","Marshall","She's still there! Okay Mabel, let's find you a new home. Here comes a guy! And he... he just walked, walked right on by it. He's probably rushing home to get a handcart or something. Yeah! Hey, better hurry up, pal. What are you guys doing with Barney's secret Robin notebook? Let me rephrase that. Did you two ladies lose some weight?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19887","Lily","What do you know about this,Marshall?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19888","Robin","Why would Barney have a notebook full of information about me?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19889","Marshall","Well...","05","03","Robin 101"
"19890","Ted (2030)","The truth was...Barney was taking a night school class taught... by me.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19891","Ted","Welcome to Robin 101.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19892","Robin","Why is Ted teaching a class about me? It all started a few weeks ago.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19893","Barney","...rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!","05","03","Robin 101"
"19894","Barney","Stinson back in. Say, hypothetically, I did want to change who I am to become a better boyfriend to Robin, which I do not! What kind of changes are we talking about?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19895","Ted","Why, I mean, there's just so much you need to know about her. Okay, for starters, don't ever cry in front her.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19896","Barney","Okay.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19897","Ted","And whatever you do, don't cry in front of her four times.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19898","Robin","Hey, guys. What you talking about?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19899","Barney and Ted","Fantasy football.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19900","Marshall","They realized they couldn't talk about this stuff at the bar, and since you live with Ted, they had to find someplace safe. So... Ted's classroom.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19901","Ted","""How To Date Robin Scherbatsky."" Lesson one. Now, even though she puts up a tough exterior, what Robin really wants, deep down...","05","03","Robin 101"
"19902","Barney","I'm bored.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19903","Ted","You said you wanted my help.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19904","Barney","Can we draw boobs on the chalkboard?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19905","Ted","We did that ready.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19906","Barney","No, like, really big boobs.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19907","Ted","No. Look, I need this, too. I've only been a professor a few weeks. Being up here, it's, it's good practice for me.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19908","Barney","Can we have class outside?","05","03","Robin 101"

"19912","Ted","Wow, you were just, like, the worst student in the world, weren't you?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19913","Barney","They said I had A-D... something. Can we have class outside?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19914","Ted","Barney, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up. I love you and I love Robin. And I want to make this work. So if you give me a few weeks of attention, I could give you a lifetime of happiness. Can you do that for me?","05","03","Robin 101"

"19919","Barney","You guys just had s*x? Oh! Wasn't me.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19920","Ted","Dude! I worked really hard on these slides, okay? Can we just...","05","03","Robin 101"
"19921","Barney","Okay.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19922","Ted","This look is hunger. If you ever see Robin looking like this, get some food in her quick,or one of two things will happen. One  weird, out-of-context laughter. (changing the photo) Or two  spontaneously falling to sleep in strange places. But the most important facial expression of all?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19923","Barney","That's a building.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19924","Ted","Oh... (chuckling) That's for my class. TheFlatironBuilding. Fun story about it. It was designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style; this architectural gem...","05","03","Robin 101"
"19925","Barney","Dude!","05","03","Robin 101"
"19926","Ted","Right. The most important facial expression of all.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19927","Barney","Whoa...","05","03","Robin 101"
"19928","Ted","Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. If you ever, ever see this face, Barney, run. And don't take a picture of it. She will punch you. And you will cry... for the third time... that night. Which brings us to an important point  defusing the bomb.","05","03","Robin 101"

"19944","Ted","Now, we all know Robin's not what you'd call ""touchy-feely."" She doesn't say, ""I love you,"" like a normal person. Instead, she'll laugh, shake her head, give you a little smile and say, ""You're an idiot.""","05","03","Robin 101"
"19945","Barney","""You're an idiot""?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19946","Ted","Yup. If she tells you you're an idiot, you're a lucky man. And if she does say ""I love you,"" she's already broken up with you in her mind.","05","03","Robin 101"

"19968","Ted","Correct! Why?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19969","Barney","Butterscotch is to Canadian women what chocolate is to American women.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19970","Ted","Correct! What is Robin's dream job?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19971","Barney","To become the most successful female TV journalist of all time.","05","03","Robin 101"
"19972","Ted","Correct! And if she achieves that, will she truly be happy?","05","03","Robin 101"
"19973","Barney","No! Robin's deep-seated need for attention can traced back to her father's emotional distance, and no amount of success will ever make up for what she truly needs, which is six simple words from her Dad  ""Robin, I'm proud of you, eh?""","05","03","Robin 101"

"19997","Ted","Oh, that's Shin-Ya. He's sort of been auditing the class.","05","03","Robin 101"

"19999","Ted","Well, tried to explain to him it wasn't a real class, but I don't think he speaks much English.","05","03","Robin 101"

"20005","Lily","(sneezing)  Kiss ass.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20006","Robin","You know, half the stuff in this notebook is patently wrong.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20007","Ted","Uh, really? Name one wrong thing.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20008","Robin","""Robin Scherbatsky's Surprising Erogenous Zones""? Let me clear something up for you, Ted.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20009","Ted","Does lefty like that?","05","03","Robin 101"
"20010","Robin","(embarassed) Oh. Yeah...","05","03","Robin 101"
"20011","Ted","Don't wanna leave out the righty.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20012","Robin","Oh, uh, no. Um, the right one's ticklish, I guess. But the left one, yeah, I'm glad you're back there. Because that is just some sweet, sweet lovin'.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20013","Ted","Noted.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20014","Ted","That was a lie?","05","03","Robin 101"
"20015","Robin","We had just started dating. I was being nice.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20016","Robin","(to Barney) And you. You know, I got it into my head this week that you were cheating on me. I even broke open your briefcase to look for evidence.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20017","Barney","That is a huge violation of my privacy! Go on.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20018","Robin","You know, in a way, I was right. You cheated. You can't get some crib sheet on dating me. That's not how it works. If we didn't figure out how to be with each other in a real, honest way, I don't see the point of even trying.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20019","Robin","What do you want?","05","03","Robin 101"
"20020","Ted","Look. All that stuff I told Barney... It was personal between you and me. I'm really sorry.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20021","Robin","I guess I'm impressed by how much you remembered.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20022","Ted","It's funny. When you date someone, it's like you're taking one long course in who that person is and then, when you break up, all that stuff becomes useless. It's the emotional equivalent of an English degree. I guess I just liked the idea of putting all my Robin Scherbatsky knowledge to good use, you know?","05","03","Robin 101"
"20023","Robin","Well, since you know me pretty well... am I fooling myself with this whole Barney thing?","05","03","Robin 101"
"20024","Ted","I don't know. I will say this, though. I've seen Barney work very hard to get women. I've seen him work very hard to get rid of women. I've never seen him work this hard to keep one around. I was going to give him an A. Well, B+ -- Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20025","Barney","Hey. Before you say anything, I am done with this stupid Robin 101, okay? Here, I'll get rid of the notebook. (he throws it on the barrel) But there's... there's something that I did want to say to you. Robin, I have been with a lot of women, blondes, brunettes, redheads, big boobs, small","05","03","Robin 101"
"20026","Robin","You're an idiot.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20027","Robin","You know...","05","03","Robin 101"
"20028","Barney","Hmm?","05","03","Robin 101"
"20029","Robin","That notebook, um, does contain a lot of personal info, and I think it has my home address.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20030","Barney","And your work address.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20031","Barney","Whoa.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20032","Marsahll","(upstais, lookin gout the window) Hey, guys! If you don't want the barrel, can you sit somewhere else? You're scaring away potential takers.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20033","Ted","Designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style, this architectural gem was the first of its kind...","05","03","Robin 101"
"20034","Student","Uh, Professor Mosby?","05","03","Robin 101"
"20035","Ted","Yes, Susan?","05","03","Robin 101"
"20036","Student","That's a woman drinking beer on the toilet.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20037","Ted","Right. That-That... was Daniel Burnham's wife. She was a troubled, troubled woman. We are moving on.","05","03","Robin 101"
"20038","Ted (2030)","It was the Fall of 2009 and I was a professor now. So I decided to change my look a little bit. And people were noticing.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20039","Barney","Ah, tweed. Textile of the eunuch.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20040","Marshall","You know, I've always wondered why those tweed jackets have elbow patches.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20041","Barney","Because the people who wear them are constantly going, ""Aw, geez, why can't I get laid?""","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20042","Ted","You are wrong. The ladies dig the professor look.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20043","Robin","You know, there is something to that. I remember thinking my tenth grade math teacher was very sexy. I wonder if Harold's still in jail. What? Tax evasion. Among other things.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20044","Lily","So guys, Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place for a little couples' night.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20045","Robin","Uh, sure. Why not?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"

"20049","Ted (2030)","They sucked at it.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20050","Lily","This is great. We're having fun. You're having fun, right?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20051","Marshall","So, should we just go ahead and lock the four of us in for new year's?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20052","Guy","Um, it's April.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20053","Marshall","Right. Sorry. We're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's talk Thanksgiving.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20054","Lily","Our parents really want to meet you!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20055","Guy","Well, we should probably be going.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20056","Marshall","Wait. But, wait, if you leave now, Colonel mustard just gets away with it.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20057","Woman","It's getting pretty late. We're going to go.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20058","Lily","(blocking their way) There's still pie.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20059","Marshall","Tonight was fantastic. We should do it again.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20060","Man","I'm sorry, Marshall, but Falguni and I are just not that into you. And you.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20061","Ted (2030)","But just when Lily and Marshall were about to give up, two of their best friends in the world got together. And hope returned to their hearts.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20062","Lily","(flashback when she saw Robin and Barney kissing) Wohoo!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20063","Ted (2030)","So when Lily said...","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20064","Lily","Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place for a little couples' night.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20065","Robin","Um, sure, why not?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20066","Ted (2030)","Barney and Robin had no idea what they were about to walk into.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20067","Lily","Okay. Game time. Let's review the flow of the room. (moving in the room) Barney and Robin enter here. Stop here for margaritas. That's a great conversation starter. We can tell them about nour trip to Cabo.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20068","Marshall","Great, 'cause I got that story about Sammy Hagar Anthe Belgian waffle locked and loaded.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20069","Lily","Then we'll move on to the hot apps station. And, depending on how things are going, Some lively pre-dinner charades.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20070","Marshall","Right, but, uh, we'll play that one by... (showing his ears)","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20071","Lily","Sounds like?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20072","Marshall","Okay, you can be Robin's partner.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20073","Lily","Oh... Baby, we can do this.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20074","Lily","Welcome.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20075","Marshall","Gouda?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20076","Ted (2030)","Meanwhile, my half-baked theory that ladies dig the professor look was actually proving to be true.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20077","Girl","So is it hard to grade papers?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20078","Ted","No, you've just got to make it fun. For example, uh, every time I spot a grammatical error, I do a shot. I'm trashed right now, and I blame our public school system.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20079","Ted (2030)","Sometimes things just seem to magically fall into place.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20080","Girl","So, you said you live right upstairs...","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20081","Ted (2030)","Whether it's in the dating world...","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20082","Lily","Take care. Bye.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20083","Ted (2030)","Or the double-dating world.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"

"20085","Marshall","Best night ever!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"

"20087","Ted","Hey, how was the big couples' night with Marshall and Lily?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20088","Robin","Brutal.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20089","Ted","Really? How?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20090","Barney","It was like we were on a date with a sad, chubby girl our mom made us call.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20091","Robin","And they were so nervous, that they weren't even making sense half of the time.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20092","Lily","Hey. Come on in. Would you like a margarita?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20093","Marshall","In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating a Belgian waffle!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20094","Barney","And they kept shoving platters of food in our faces.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20095","Ted","Let me guess  Did Marshall get, like, super intense about the cheese?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20096","Robin","Yeah, how'd you know?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20097","Ted","Poor Marshall., Lily's this gourmet cook, and all she letsMarshall do ss pick out one sad block of cheese.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"

"20103","Marshall","Ooh...Tick-tock goes thegouda clock.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20104","Barney","Um, we-we-we didn't realize there was gonna be dinner. We sucked down a couple tacos outside the subway.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20105","Robin","P.S., not sitting great.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20106","Barney","And if anything didn't go according to plan, they would freak out.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20107","Lily","What do you mean, the egg timer is broken? What are we going to use for charades, sweetie?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20108","Marshall","I'm working on it, darling. Okay? Just stall them.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20109","Lily","Now, Robin... You work in television. We're experiencing some technical difficulties. ( she laughs)  You get that? We're still laughing. Right? Laugh,Marshall.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20110","Ted","Come on, they just got excited. They've been looking for couple best friends forever. Plus, I'm sure they weren't that bad.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20111","Robin","Show him.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20112","Barney","This is a web siteMarshall already made about last night. (he takes a computer) It's called itwasthebestnightever.com.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20113","Marshall (voice)","It was the best night ever laughter raining down like April showers oh, we talked for hours... best night ever...","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20114","Ted","oh, that's not good.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20115","Marshall (always singing in the video)","Then we played charades. Lily made some creme brulee, lay-lay-lay-lay and now that we're best couple friends there's only one thing left to say... are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free next Saturday? That's the 17th.are you free? Friday or Sunday would also work. Or basically any other day.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20116","Barney","Needless to say, we've both changed our e-mail addresses.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20117","Ted","I don't understand. If last night went so horribly, why do Lily and Marshall think it was such a hit?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20118","Barney","I mean, we knew we were gonna have fun tonight, but we had no idea how much.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20119","Marshall","Oh.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20120","Robin","Yeah, tough luck, every Saturday night I've ever had, 'cause this one just blew you out of the water.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20121","Barney","Let's do it again, soon.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20122","Robin","Yeah, we'll call you.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20123","Ted","They're your friends! Why would you just blatantly lie to them like that?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20124","Robin","Well, that's what you say at the end of a crappy date.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20125","Girl","Hey, Ted. Great time last night. Well, let's do it again, soon. I'll...uh, call you.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20126","Ted","Right?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20127","Robin","Who was that?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20128","Ted","Oh, I don't want to brag, But it seems chicks are really digging the whole professor thing. Last night, she picked me up at the bar. And then... Well, she actually wound up falling asleep on the couch. But, hey, that happens.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20129","Barney","Uh, no, it doesn't.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20130","Ted","Sure, it does. You know, she was, she was just exhausted from being turned on. But you heard her. She wants to do it again, soon.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20131","Barney","Ted, let me ask you a question. Where does this girl live, exactly?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20132","Ted","Westchester. Why?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20133","Barney","(he laughs) You're the sexless innkeeper.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20134","Robin","Oh, my god! You're right! He's totally the sexless innkeeper!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20135","Ted","What the hell is ""the sexless innkeeper""?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20136","Barney","Ted, many a man--nay, many a soul--has their own tale of the sexless innkeeper. Why, I had run-in with one just last year. I even composed a poem about it. Would you care to hear it?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20137","Ted","Not really.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20138","Barney","T'was the night before new year's, and the weather grew mean. It was 3 00 in the morning, And I was stranded in queens. (2008, the whole story of Barney is illustrated with images) The tavern grew empty, the gas lights grew dim. The horse-drawn carriages were all but snowed in...","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20139","Ted","Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20140","Barney","Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, ""where do you live?""And she said, ""one block south."". I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20141","Ted","Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20142","Barney","Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20143","Ted","No way.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20144","Barney","I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20145","Robin","Which is funny, because usually it's the innkeeper who offers turndown service. Oh!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20146","Lily","Hey, guys. Good news. First of all, you can ignore all the e-mails and texts we've sent you.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20147","Robin","We have. Go on.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20148","Lily","Because we went ahead and booked that couples' weekend for all of us inVermont!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20149","Robin","Wait, you guys were serious about that?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20150","Marshall","Oh, we never joke about b&b's, especially at the height of syrup season.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20151","Lily","Check it out. Saturday we've got apple-picking, antiquing, then a hated hay ride.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20152","Marshall","And then on Sunday, we're up at 6 00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike. Now, you better pack your long johns, 'cause it is cold up there.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20153","Barney","Look! I'm sorry that we have been dodging your calls, but we respect you guys too much as friends to give you some song and dance. You deserve the truth. (he sighs) The US Navy has found intelligent alien life at the bottom of the ocean. For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I have been tapped to lead the expedition.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20154","Lily","Wow, Barney. That kind of sounds like the stuff you say to girls when you're too much of a coward to dump them.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20155","Marshall","Yeah. You know, that's exactly what it sounds like. But if that's true, that's awesome.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20156","Lily","What's going on?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20157","Robin","Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20158","Barney","Plus, the alien thing.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20159","Lily","Come on,Marshall.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20160","Marshall","Let's go.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20161","Robin","No...Lily...","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20162","Marshall","You know what? I hope those underwater aliens are cold-blooded. 'cause then you guys will get along just fine.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20163","Barney","I think they bought it.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20164","Marshall","I can't believe they broke up with us.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20165","Lily","We're so lovable.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20166","Marshall","No, we're not. We're ugly and gross.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20167","Lily","I thought we did everything right.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20168","Marshall","I know! I know. We had thegouda. We had my waffle story. I even sent them a awesome photo montage. Nothing.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20169","Lily","Oh, dear god.Marshall, we've been over and over this. You have to stop sending those to people.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20170","Ted (2030)","It was true.Marshall had become addicted to creating songs and photo montages documenting various mundane events. So for months, all of Marshall's friends and professional colleagues were getting e-mails like this...","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20171","Marshall (singing on the video)","ordered Chinese food today some moo shu pork sauce got away flipped the cushion, now everything's okay.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20172","Marshall","Cat-sitting for Lily's mom, cat-sitting for Lily's mom, it's gonna be fun, it's gonna bring us all closer together. (in the video,Marshall let the cats going out by the window)","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20173","Marshall","Cat funeral, cat funeral, it was an accident and not entirely my fault, cat funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow, ca funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow. We'll miss you, whiskers, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow...","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20174","Lily","I can't believe you sent them one of those. They think we're insane now.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20175","Marshall","If I recall, they didn't dump us until you brought up thatVermont trip. It was way too early. First, a boat ride around the city, then a trip toVermont. It's a rookie mistake, and you're better than that.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20176","Lily","Oh, what about you forgetting to check the egg timer for charades? I gave you one thing to do,Marshall. One thing.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20177","Marshall","One thing? (Lily nods) One thing? Wow. Really? So, I guess that gouda Just walked itself right through the door...Sliced itself up, and arranged itself in a perfect semi-circle around not three, not four... But five different kinds of sturdy, cheese-bearing crackers?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20178","Lily","You're a sturdy, cheese-bearing cracker!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20179","Ted","Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20180","Barney","Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day, But don't you have to get back up to the inn? I mean, who's working the front desk?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20181","Ted","Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20182","Barney","To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20183","Ted","Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20184","Robin","You're right.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20185","Ted","Thank you.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20186","Robin","All that sexlessness has made you wise.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20187","Ted","For god's sake!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20188","Barney","Mint on the pillow, Ted! And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy! It does.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20189","Ted (2030)","But eventually, even Barney and Robin had to admit they owed Lily and Marshall an apology.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20190","Robin","Hey. We wanted to say we're sorry.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20191","Lily","Oh. I wish you had called.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20192","Marshall","(to a couple, inside the apartment) I swear, he was right there just eating a Belgian waffle!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20193","Guy","Well, he can't have enjoyed it as much as I'm enjoying thisgouda!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20194","Marshall","Oh!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20195","Lily","Um, listen, now's not a good time. We'll call you.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20196","Robin","Wait. We just want...","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20197","Marshall","Hey! Hey, guys.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20198","Barney","Hey. Long time no see. Have a seat.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20199","Lily","Oh, we can't. We're here with Py and Shea.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20200","Marshall","Yeah, sorry.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20201","Robin","Oh, it's just... We haven't seen you guys all week.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20202","Barney","Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20203","Robin","Yeah.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20204","Lily","Oh, it might be weird. We're kind of on a double date. Wouldn't want you to feel like a fifth and sixth wheel.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20205","Barney","Who the hell are these people?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20206","Lily","They just moved here fromHawaii. Py is a total foodie","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20207","Marshall","Mmm!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20208","Lily","And Shea, well... She's...","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20209","Marshall","Shea...Shea is just...","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20210","Lily","Anyhoo, we can't stay long. We're just gonna grab a quick beer and then take these kooks for a boat ride around the city.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20211","Robin","Wow, it sounds like this is getting pretty serious.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20212","Marshall","Well, we don't want to jinx it, but, uh... We kind of think they might be the two. (he touches the table) Ooh.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20213","Robin","Pfft, who needs 'em?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20214","Barney","Pfft. Not us.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20215","Barney and Robin are walking sadly in the street. We can hear a song","","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20216","Robin","Hi. Two for dinner.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20217","Woman","Just the two of you?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20218","Barney","Hey, why don't we call that weird couple down the hall from you? You know, with the ferrets? Maybe they want to come over and play taboo.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20219","Robin","After midnight? No way. We can't tabooty-call them, it's pathetic.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20220","Ted","Hey, guys.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20221","Ted","Barney, are you wearing sweat pants?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20222","Barney","Maybe. But they're Armani.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20223","Ted","Okay, guys, I've got some bad news for you. So I'm just going to come out and say it. You're a couple. And no matter how hard you try to fight it, couples need other couples. That's why you miss Marshall and Lily. And can't you just admit that?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20224","Marshall","Oh, yeah!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20225","Girl","That was amazing, Lily!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20226","Lily","I know! When I got that left-hand- yellow, I was like, ""what?!""","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20227","Guy","You guys are the best.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20228","Marshall","Oh, right back at you!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"

"20232","Robin","You don't.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20233","Marshall","You know what? We have two very nice people up in that apartment Who are perfect for us.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20234","Barney","Then what are you doing, standing out in the rain with us?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20235","Lily","Damn it. Why is there something so attractive about a bad boy... And girl?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20236","Marshall","I think we can change them.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20237","Lily","Come here, you two.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20238","Barney","We'll never sleep on thegouda again.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20239","Ted","Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you. You want to hear it?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20240","Barney","No, not really.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20241","Ted","'twas the night before, I had hours to kill. (the whole story is illustrated with images) I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20242","Barney","With quill?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20243","Ted","Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said ""classy,"" but her eyes whispered ""sin."" She said, ""you're a teacher?"" I said, ""yes, indeed."" ""I must have you,"" she moaned.""I'm turned on by tweed."" With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20244","Barney","No way. You made that up.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20245","Girl","Are you coming back bed, professor?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20246","Barney","Whew!","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20247","Ted","God, I love being single.","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20248","Robin","Barney, you ready for brunch with Lily and Marshall?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20249","Marshall","(worried) What have I done?","05","04","The Sexless Innkeeper"
"20250","Ted (2030)","Kids, as you know, Aunt Robin grew up in Canada. That meant sometimes she dressed &agrave; little differently.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20251","Robin","Okay, let's do this!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20252","Ted (2030)","Sometimes she talked a little differently.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20253","Robin","Ted, this hydro bill is bigger than Louis Cyr's biceps. What, you leave the garburator on all night, eh?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20254","Ted (2030)","She hung out at different bars and enjoyed leisure time a little differently.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20255","fighting","You want to go? You want to go?! Come on! (In McLaren's...) Make fun of the Great White North all you want. It's the best country in the world.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20256","Barney","The... mmm. Social experiment. (Chanting) U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A...","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20257","Robin","Okay, okay. You know what, what does that even prove, okay? You chant anything, people we join in. (Chanting) Canada, Canada, Canada, Cana... Okay, they won't chant anything.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20258","Barney, singing","Shrimp fried rice...","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20259","All singing","Shrimp fried rice, shrimp fried rice...","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20260","Ted, joining them","Shrimp fried rice totally. Anyway, speaking of food, Marshall, I've got so bad news. Just read online, Gazzola's is closing.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20261","Marshall","No!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20262","Robin","What Gazzola's?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20263","Ted","A filthy mecca of spectacular if undercooked pizza located at 316 Kinzie Street, Chicago, Illinois.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20264","Marshall","Back in college, Ted and I used to take these crazy road trips from Connecticut all the way to Chicago just for Gazzola's pizza.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20265","Ted","22 hours. No map. We'd just jump in the Fiero and drive. We were like Lewis and Clark, if Lewis and Clark peed in empty soda bottles and had a bong made out of a cantaloupe.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20266","Marshall","Man, those Gazzola trips, that's... that's when we really became bros.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20267","Ted","Mm. We ate nothing but jerky.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20268","Marshall","Drank nothing but Tantrum.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20269","Ted (2030)","Ah, Tantrum. Tantrum was a soft drink with the highest caffeine content legally available over the counter. It was eventually discontinued after an extensive study by the FDA.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20270","Marshall","Oh, man, we went through a whole case of Tantrum one trip.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20271","Ted","I was color blind for two weeks after that.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20272","Marshall","I think that's the reason that I pass out when I hear church bells.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20273","Ted","It's probably a good thing they're closing Gazzola's. Those trips were brutal, right? The long hours in the car, the motion sickness, the smell.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20274","Marshall","So what time are we leaving for Gazzola's tomorrow?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20275","Ted","I was thinking 9 00, 9 30.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20276","Ted","I am ready to hit the road. I got baby wipes. I got a variety of jerky. I got six cans of Tantrum. Well, four. One burned though the can, the other one I drank already. (He tears a pillow) Tantrum! I am so psyched! Marshall and I haven't done something, just the two of us, for so long. Ever since he got married, he's turned from an ""I"" to a ""We"".","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20277","Barney","What do you mean?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20278","Ted","Think about it.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20279","Ted","Hey, haven't seen you all week. How you doing?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20280","Marshall, in bar with Lily","We're doing great.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"

"20282","Marshall","We most certainly did.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20283","Ted","How'd things go at the doctor?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20284","Marshall","We no longer have a hemorrhoid problem.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20285","Barney","Hmm.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20286","Robin","You guys will not believe this. I've been talking to my lawyer all morning. You know that guy I have a slight disagreement with at the Hoser Hut? He's filing assault charges.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20287","Robin","Come on!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20288","Robin","I broke his nose with a chair. And now, apparently, I may end up getting deported.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20289","Ted","Oh, my God, that sucks! Yeah. I'm gonna go do push-ups in the kitchen. Tantrum!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20290","Robin","Well, there's only one possible way to avoid getting deported. My lawyer said I could become an American citizen.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20291","Barney","Perfect. Problem solved. Welcome aboard.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20292","Robin","Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20293","Barney","I know, and it's provided us with a lot of laughs. But, Robin, if you want to live here, work here and throw chairs at people here, you have to do this.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20294","Robin","Well, there's a citizenship test tomorrow.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20295","Barney","A cit...","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20296","Robin","I'll think about it.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20297","Barney","No, no, you have to do it. I'll help you study. We're gonna stay up all night long. I'm gonna drill you, and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna do some cramming and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna bone up on...","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20298","Robin","Okay, Barney.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20299","Barney","Sorry. It's a rich area.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20300","Robin","It is.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20301","Barney","But you know, it's not going to be easy, this test. It's not like the Canadian citizenship test.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20302","Robin","How do you know the Canadian test is easy?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20303","Barney","It's Canada. Question one  Do you want to be Canadian? Question two  really?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20304","Marshall, entering with ""a hat with drink""","Ted! Ted! Check it out! I got black coffee on the left, I got Tantrum on the right! Do you have a phone book?!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20305","Ted","Yes, I do! I don't why they make phone books anymore. Everything's online, right?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20306","Marshall","Tantrum!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20307","Ted","Tantrum!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20308","Lily","All right, let's hit the road.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20309","Ted","You invited Lily?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20310","Marshall","We most certainly did!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20311","Barney","I don't know if you caught that, but he did the ""we"" thing.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20312","Ted","Yeah, I heard him.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20313","Barney","Okay.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20314","Lily","Road trip! So you guys want to talk about bitches? I'm kidding. They're called women.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20315","Ted","All right, next stop  Chicago.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20316","Lily","I have to pee.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20317","Ted","Couldn't you have gone before we left?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20318","Lily","I did. I just pee a lot. You'll see.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20319","Marshall","Don't worry, we'll get out on the road, it'll be just like old times.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20320","Ted (2030)","It wasn't.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20321","Lily","Sugar snap pea? Pea... That reminds me, I have to pee.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20322","Ted","Okay, straight, straight, straight. Now, wait, a little to the left. We'll pass a state trooper.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20323","Lily, fighting Ted","Ooh, punch buggy yellow!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20324","Ted","Ow!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20325","Lily","Yellow, that reminds me, I have to pee.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20326","Ted","Thank you!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20327","Lily","Great. Oh, hey, Ted...","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20328","Ted","You can't have to go again. It's not humanly possible.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20329","Lily","No, I was just going to say maybe we should listen to something.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20330","Ted","Oh, that's a great idea. I think I have some Jerky Boys.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20331","Marshall","Goodbye, Sparky.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20332","Lily","It's an audio book about a boy and his dog. It made Elisabeth Hasselbeck cry.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20333","Voice","Goodbye Sparky, by Nick Leotti. Read to you by Kenny Rogers.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20334","Marshall","Oh!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20335","Kenny","Chapter one  When I first saw Sparky, he reminded me of my favorite comb; he was missing a lot of teeth, but I loved him anyway. Mother was fit to be tied every time he used her prized rhododendron to do his business.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20336","Lily","That reminds me, I have to pee.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20337","Barney","""How many stars are on the flag?""","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20338","Robin","50, one for each state.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20339","Barney","""What are the first ten amendments to the Constitution called?""","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20340","Robin","The Bill of Rights. Look, Barney, I know all this. I'm ready.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20341","Barney","Ready for the test maybe, but ready to be an American? Not on your sweet life. For you to be an American, we got to get the Canadian out of you. That's why I've created these questions. Question one  ""Who is this?""","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20342","Robin","Queen Elizabeth II.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20343","Barney","No, the answer is Elton John. Question two  ""What the hell is this?""","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20344","Robin","Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played...","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20345","Barney","Wrong. The answer we were looking for was ""I don't care, it's dumb"". Let's go buy something that's bad for us and then sue the people who made it. That's America, Robin.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20346","Kenny","...because Sparky loved chasing a ball, and it didn't much matter what kind. Tennis ball, baseball, Wiffle ball, golf ball, basketball, beach ball, gum ball, a grapefruit- which isn't actually a ball, but's round like a ball- a football- which isn't round, but it's still technically a ball- Indian rubber ball...","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20347","Voice","This ends disk seven. The audio book continues on disk eight. (Ted removes the disk and puts back the other one) Disk eight.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20348","Kenny","Lacrosse ball, volleyball...","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20349","Ted","Oh, my God, Lily, please tell me you have to go pee!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20350","Lily","Ah, I do.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20351","Ted (2030)","It was the worst trip ever, but then it got worse.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20352","Marshall","Well, don't worry, the next exit's the hotel. We can go there.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20353","Ted","Hotel?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20354","Woman","Crumpet Manor is listed in the American Registry of Historic Bed and Breakfasts. Our door is opened on Christmas day, 1881. And we have catered to couples ever since.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20355","Marshall","Well, I mean, single people can have fun here, too, right?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20356","Woman","Oh, I suppose I could arrange a little recreation. Do you enjoy sitting on a bench?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20357","Ted (2030)","And by the end of the night, Barney had turned Robin into a real American.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20358","Robin","I want to say- Jefferson?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20359","Barney","Correct.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20360","Robin","Oh!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20361","Barney","Archie Bunker's neighbor was George Jefferson.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20362","Robin","Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20363","Barney","All right, hold your horses. Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie and the childhood obesity it leads to- who is this?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20364","Robin","That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the ""Hey, Vern"" guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20365","Barney","Jeff Foxworthy? No, it's Jim Varney. You're kidding me. You don't know that?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20366","Robin","Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20367","Barney","Not only are you wrong, but you are belligerently sticking to your guns and insulting me in the process. Robin Scherbatsky- you are an American.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20368","Woman","Look who's back from the wishing well.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20369","Ted","It didn't work, I'm still here. Marshall, what are we doing? We should be on the road.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20370","Marshall","Ok, Ted, we're not in college anymore, okay? We don't have to drive all night.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20371","Lily","Besides, they have a spa. What kind of treatments do you offer?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20372","Woman","All our spa treatments are designed for couples. Would you be interested in the two person, cornmeal body scrub?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20373","Ted (2030)","And then finally it happened. Marshall and Lily globbed into one big married glob.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20374","Marshall and Lily","We'd love cornmeal body scrub!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20375","Ted","Whoa. I got to dial back on the Tantrum.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20376","Robin","Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all. (She throws one bottle on the floor) Maybe I'll rob a liquor store. Maybe I won't. My choice. Learn English! The Hoser Hut. I could duck in for a drink. No, no, that life's behind me. Forget it. Well, I could in for just one beer. What's the harm in that? It's a free country. (She crosses the road and enter into the bar) *O Canada Our home and native land...* Oh, God, I miss it. *True patriots love...*","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20377","Ted","Hey, man.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20378","Marshall","Shh.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20379","Ted","Sorry about what I said before. You want to go to the store and get some beer?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20380","Marshall","Lily is asleep. I suppose I could reschedule my pedicure. What the hell? But only light beer because we have a couple hike in the morning.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20381","Marshall","Dude, why are we pulling to the highway? Ted, where exactly are we going to get this beer?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20382","Ted","Chicago.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20383","Marshall","What are you doing? We can't just leave Lily. When she wakes up, she's going to freak!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20384","Ted","She'll have a back rub and a crumpet. She'll be fine. Relax. Have some fun.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20385","Marshall","I just abandoned my wife. How am I supposed to have fun?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20386","Marshall and Ted, singing","*And I would walk 500 miles. And I would walk 500 more...*","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20387","Ted","Hey, you really think Lily's pissed?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20388","Marshall","If she's pissed, she's pissed.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20389","Ted","Pfft.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20390","Ted (2030)","When Barney finally tracked down your Aunt Robin, it wasn't a pretty sight.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20391","Barney","Good morning.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20392","Robin","Barney? Oh, my God. What happened last night?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20393","Barney","You went Canadian.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20394","Robin","How Canadian?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20395","Barney","This Canadian. (He opens the curtains) Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky- you're in Toronto.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20396","Robin","Oh, God. Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut... And I met this women's curling team.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20397","Robin","We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams/Rich title double bill in Toronto.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20398","Robin","How did you find me, anyway?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20399","Barney","You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic...","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20400","Robin","Canada isn't across the Atlantic.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20401","Barney","You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20402","Robin","Barney, I'm not taking the test.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20403","Barney","God, you're still drunk.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20404","Robin","Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20405","Barney","Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee, in you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test. But, before any of that, we're gonna do it on this bed 'cause... hotel room. Okay, let's get some coffee.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20406","Ted","Kind of cross.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20407","Marshall","You're making me wonder if this pizza is worth the 22 hour drive.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20408","Ted","Just like old times!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20409","Marshall","I feel so young again except for the chest pains.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20410","Ted","But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20411","Man","It's no big secret. It's made of cornmeal.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20412","Marshall","Cornmeal...","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20413","Lily","We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20414","Ted","I can't believe you guys are closing.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20415","Man","I can't believe we're still open. Gotcha! These are getting bigger.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20416","Barney","It's like an entire country without a tailor.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20417","Robin","Yeah, give me two coffees.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20418","Women","$3,50, please. Hey, what did you think of the game last night?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20419","Robin","What game?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20420","Women","The Leafs beat Edmonton. Beauchemin went five hole in OT.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20421","Robin","Oh, I guess I missed it.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20422","Women","Oh, sorry. You're American. Here's your change.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20423","Robin","I'm not American.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20424","Women","American money? Didn't watch the Leafs game? No ""please"" or ""thank you"" for the coffee? You sure don't seem like a Canadian.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20425","Barney","What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20426","Robin","Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20427","Barney","And there's kids playing hockey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20428","Marshall","I don't want this anymore.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20429","Ted","Dude, don't look at it. That's a rookie mistake.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20430","Marshall","We shouldn't have left Lily.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20431","Ted","Well, if you're so worried, why don't you give her a call?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20432","Marshall","I have. I left her, like, 20 messages. I said, ""I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's all Ted's fault!""","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20433","Ted","What exactly is ""Ted's fault""?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20434","Marshall","This! This whole thing! We were having a perfectly nice trip, and then you kidnapped me. You didn't even let me, put on underwear!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20435","Ted","We never used to put on underwear! That was the fun of a bro's trip to Gazzola's! We left everything, and everyone behind. It was just you and me! But now it's like you've disappeared into Lily.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20436","Marshall","That is not true.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20437","Ted","It is true. You're not upset because you're worried she's mad. You're upset because you'd rather be with her, eating muffins than here with me, eating this delicious... I think one of my mushrooms just crawled away.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20438","Marshall","Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's living. Car keys, please.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20439","Barney","Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20440","Robin","When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20441","Barney","Okay, that's it. (He climbs on a chair) Attention, Canada! I am Barney from America. And I'm here to fix your backward-ass country. Number one  get real money. Don't know what board game this came from, but it's a ""jhoke"". Number two- and this is the biggie- Quit letting awesome chicks like Robin Scherbatsky get away because, guess what? You don't want her? I'm planting my flag in her- if you know what I mean, which you probably don't- and getting her the hell out of here. You may now return to being pointless. (He sits down and three men arrive behind him) Ah, this coffee is excellent. Oh. Hey, fellas. It's called a ""tie"".","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20442","Kenny","Sparky was my best friend, but after I married Helen, old Spark started to feel a little left out. For so long, it had been just me and him, but now he suddenly felt like Helen had taken his place. What Sparky didn't realize was, even though I loved Helen, I still loved him, too. I had room in my heart for both of them. But maybe I should have put aside some special ball-tossing time just for the two of us t o make sure Sparky knew that he was a good boy. I wish now I had, 'cause old Sparky ran out in front of a Cadillac and got splattered like a watermelon in one of them Gallagher shows.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20443","Marshall","I'm sorry, ted!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20444","Ted","I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. I never should have been mad at you!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20445","Marshall","No, I never should have brought lily. She pees all the time, even at the apartment. Still bros?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20446","Ted","Best bros. Hey, you want to crank some Van Halen just like old times?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20447","Marshall","Hells, yeah!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20448","Ted","Or listen to the Sparky book again?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20449","Marshall","Listen to the Sparky book again.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20450","Ted","Okay. Let's listen to it again.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20451","Barney","Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20452","Robin","Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, ""Yeah, America's cool.""","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20453","Barney","Hmm.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20454","Robin","And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, ""Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too."" I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20455","Barney","Wait, you can do that?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20456","Robin","Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20457","Barney","I see.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20458","Robin","You understand?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20459","Barney","No, I can see out of my left eye again.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20460","Marshall","Hey, baby? Baby?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20461","Lily","Hmm? Yeah?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20462","Marshall","I'm so sorry that we left you.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20463","Lily","Did you go somewhere, sweetie?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20464","Ted (2030)","Yes, kids, it turns out Crumpet Manor had pampered Lily into a nearly comatose state of relaxation. She didn't even notice we were gone.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20465","Lily","Mmm... Oh, oh, oh... Yeah...","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20466","Lily","So, I had a great time, too.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20467","Marshall","That's good. And I'm so sorry you didn't get any pizza.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20468","Lily","Oh, that's okay.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20469","Ted (2030)","And if she didn't mean it then, she certainly meant it 19 minutes later.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20470","Marshall","God, my stomach! Damn you, Gazzola's!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20471","Ted","It's like a hot ball of lead!","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20472","Marshall","Baby, cut it out of me.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20473","Marshall","That was a wild trip, huh, Ted?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20474","Ted","I know. It was kind of crazy. But how great is it to drink some Tantrum again?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20475","Marshall","You know who had fun, was Lily. Lily drank like, four cans of the stuff. Right Lil'? Where's Lily?","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20476","Lily, on the roof of the car","Tantrum! I have to pee.","05","05","Duel Citizenship"
"20477","Ted (2030)","In autumn 2009, a new couple moved just above.We had not met but you could hear all the time. They kept... children, say they did not stop ""playing the bagpipes.""","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20478","Robin","This is nonsense. They are still playing the bagpipes.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20479","Ted","I know. It's been 6 hours. That must be the fact that Stan Tantric bagpipes.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20480","Robin","It does not stop him from screaming to play louder, but it seems that there is rather strong. I have a glass of water in my room that vibrates like Jurassic Park.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20481","Ted","Are there neighbors! Stop the bagpipes!","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20482","Ted (2030)","I decided to go to the bar to be quiet. It was not really that.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20483","Barney","I hate to be the one to tell you. Marshall and Lily get divorced.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20484","Ted","Not at all.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20485","Barney","Look what I saw yesterday.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20486","Lily","Baby, you can wash it?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20487","Marshall","No problem.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20488","Barney","I gotta go.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20489","Barney","She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20490","Ted","There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20491","Barney","They have a big problem.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20492","Ted","I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... ""little known"" because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Robin, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20493","Barney","If, when you're great like me. Listen to this. Robin taking into account the number of beds in which we did. One is 83 and a half.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20494","Ted","And a half?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20495","Barney","An Ottoman 19th in an antique shop.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20496","Marshall","What's new?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20497","Barney","Big Tiger. You holding up? Want a hug? You mean yesterday? You're safe here.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20498","Ted","According to Barney, Lily asking you to do your own dishes right away is a sign that your marriage falls apart.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20499","Marshall","Why? Lily loves a clean sink so I do the dishes right away, what's the problem?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20500","Barney","I'll tell you what's the problem. You know how I was always the best single? Now I'm the best in relationship. Even better than you and Lily.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20501","Marshall","Look at you. You got a girlfriend for 5 minutes and you think playing in the big leagues. Adorable. Son... I'm in a relationship for your ponytail and that you were playing the guitar with Dave Matthews Mom. I am a good boyfriend when I sleep. I can do a killer foot massage, hand and prepare a great chamomile on the other, which would make you cry. Damn, I know more about how to make popcorn and watch movies with Sandra Bullock in that you'll ever know, but thank you to worry, blue.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20502","Barney","Let me ask you a question.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20503","Marshall","Go ahead.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20504","Barney","Do you mind you, if the sink is full of dirty dishes?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20505","Marshall","Not really.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20506","Barney","So what is the problem of Lily, not yours.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20507","Marshall","But if I said that, we will play, so...","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20508","Barney","You argue. Robin, we do not fight.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20509","Ted","Of course I do.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20510","Barney","No. And here's the secret, every time we say we're going to argue...","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20511","Robin","Why is there a bag of pants marked ""April 2008"" in your closet?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20512","Ted","So when you think you will play and you get up you go?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20513","Barney","It works in 100% of cases. No fighting if you're not there.This is what Gandhi said.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20514","Ted","This is not true.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20515","Marshall","I can not believe Robin supports it.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20516","Barney","Do not worry. It also has a good way to avoid arguments.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20517","Robin","The ties go to the machine?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20518","Marshall","You're leaving. Robin begins to coat. I never heard anything so stupid.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20519","Ted","Well, the thing naked is not bad. It was weird.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20520","Marshall","Call me crazy.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20521","Ted","Mad.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20522","Marshall","But when you have a problem with Lily, it is discussed.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20523","Barney","There's so much to do with the mouth. Why spoil it by talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say on the dishes if I was married to Lily.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20524","Lily","Barney, you came home!","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20525","Marshall","Go to the basics!","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20526","Barney","Okay.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20527","Barney","Thank you, doll.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20528","Lily","Honey, you're going to wash it?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20529","Barney","I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, ""Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel"" is what you will paint the?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20530","Lily","No. Of course not.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20531","Barney","Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20532","Lily","Thank you explained that. I get confused easily.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20533","Barney","It's because you're a woman.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20534","Lily","I do not even know why we laugh!","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20535","Barney","Of course not.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20536","Ted","Are you kidding me.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20537","Marshall","Wait, Ted. Listen to the man.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20538","Barney","Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy artillery.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20539","Barney","Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20540","Lily","You're right. I'll do the dishes. Just after doing this.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20541","Barney","Now, turn around.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20542","Ted","You beat him or I do it?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20543","Marshall","He's right.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20544","Ted","No. Marshall, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Barney Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20545","Barney","The piercing was cool.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20546","Marshall","It was cool, huh?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20547","Ted","Stay with me! Barney is wrong.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20548","Marshall","No, not at all. I hate doing the dishes right away.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20549","Ted","You just said the opposite!","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20550","Marshall","I hate it! I hate it from the depths of my soul! I hate it! I hate it I hate it!","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20551","Barney","You're welcome.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20552","Ted","Okay. There you are. You're gonna tell me the truth. Barney said that you did ever played.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20553","Robin","I think that's true.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20554","Barney","I told you.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20555","Ted","Impossible. I love you both but you're the two biggest emotional disabilities in the history of relations. You had to play at least once.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20556","Robin","You know what? It's true. We tried to find out which of us was most great. But it said draw and we made love. Speaking of that, I am delighted that we go skiing this weekend. I need a break. The upstairs neighbors make me crazy.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20557","Ted","Yeah, it's ugly. I'll go talk to them.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20558","Robin","Thank you.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20559","Barney","Super. Here are your tasks for the weekend. Ted, you're gonna go see the neighbors. Marshall, you go see Lily. Robin and I need you for a crouched position on an animal skin in our chalet. Ready? Break!","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20560","Ted","Have fun.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20561","Marshall","Barney... With his madness, his theory goes well thought might work.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20562","Ted","I will repeat once. This is a bad idea.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20563","Marshall","Will it work.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20564","Ted","A second time. This is a bad idea.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20565","Marshall","Barney argued logically. Lily is a reasonable woman. I think if I explain, understand and can go in my opinion.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20566","Ted","No. She will be angry and you will play.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20567","Marshall","It is a slap bet?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20568","Ted","We bet a slap.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20569","Lily","Baby, you can do the dishes?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20570","Marshall","Lily, I am delighted that you mention.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20571","Marshall","I can stay here tonight?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20572","Ted","I am preparing the couch, man.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20573","Robin","The ski babes are back!","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20574","Ted","How was the trip?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20575","Barney","Okay.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20576","Robin","We spent the weekend hugging the fireside. No black diamonds, nothing but red hearts. I'll unpack my bags.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20577","Ted","What has happened between you? When did you become disgusting?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20578","Barney","It's not great to finally see blossomed emotionally, spiritually and sexually?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20579","Ted","We all came out a year.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20580","Barney","short, and your weekend?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20581","Marshall","Terrible. And because of you! I listened to your advice stupid!","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20582","Lily","Baby, you can do the dishes?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20583","Marshall","Lily, I am delighted that you mention. No. And that's why... It's like, okay? You want me to get up and I wash my dishes. But maybe... I want you... combs the ceiling, right? I can say, ""Yes. I will do my dishes, if you get up and you painted the ceiling of naked babies. "" You see? It's just...","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20584","Marshall","I do not know what happened. I am a lawyer. I earn my living by arguing but when it is with Lily, I'm... confused. How not to be with her eyes and her breasts?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20585","Barney","What happened to the ""I'm tired after my exhausting day and I want to use what little energy I have left to cover you with love""?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20586","Marshall","I should have noted.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20587","Marshall","I'm making more money than you.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20588","Lily","Excuse me?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20589","Marshall","Dance for me.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20590","Marshall","It's so much better when you said but with me, it turned into an argument. And when we started arguing, it starts to mutate and multiply.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20591","Marshall","It started with the dishes but after...","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20592","Lily","So you're saying you should not do the dishes because you work harder than me.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20593","Marshall","It's not what I say... but it's true. And suddenly, we argue as to who works the hardest.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20594","Lily","I teach kindergarten. I shape the leaders of tomorrow.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20595","Marshall","You eat cookies and you glue stuff. And other disputes are parties. Until there is so much we can no longer follow.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20596","Lily","If you need to go there at night, or you turn on the light or toilet you sit.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20597","Marshall","My mother does not hate you. It is neutral about you.I'm not afraid of your imitation of Shining. I just did not need to hear it mostly at night.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20598","Lily","Danny is not here, Mrs. Torrance.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20599","Marshall","Do not do that, please.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20600","Marshall","Dude, Lily is played badly. It is small... but as a vicious badger that your brother would have caught and starved for 5 days and placed in your sleeping bag. I should go and apologize.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20601","Barney","You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean. Why, it would relieve any anxiety to any meal. Not having to tie your T-shirt to form a bowl of salted fortune for your pleasures. This world belongs to you, Marshall.Beach house, take it, put yourself in holiday clothes, benefits.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20602","Marshall","He's right.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20603","Ted","Barney's stupid ideas you have put into this mess. There is no escaping it. Make this stupid dishwasher.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20604","Marshall","This dish is my manhood! And I want to leave my manhood deep in the dirty sink full of ketchup and pasta...","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20605","Barney","What do you eat?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20606","Marshall","Well sh1t, it's my right! I will wipe my manhood when I'm ready!","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20607","Robin","Where is he was not riding? Hey, Barnstormer.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20608","Barney","Hey, Ro-Ro.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20609","Ted","You're cute nicknames? Seriously. What happens to you both?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20610","Robin","Nothing. We're just happy.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20611","Barney","As Gandhi said, ""A smile costs nothing, baby.""","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20612","Ted","I'm not sure that you know who Gandhi is.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20613","Robin","So you talked to the neighbors?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20614","Ted","Yeah, yeah, I did. I went up ready to put them back.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20615","Robin","Some old?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20616","Ted","Really old.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20617","Robin","So you did what?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20618","Ted","I did not have the strength to tell them to stop, because, good for them. So I told them you want to welcome, ate a hard caramel, acquiesced to some racist comments and I left.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20619","Ted (2030)","The days of Barney and Robin continued to be happier than ever. (At the bar, Barney and Robin dance) and Marshall and Lily have continued to argue.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20620","Marshall","I do not care if the dishes are not done. If you do not give a damn, do it.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20621","Lily","Super. So I do not care if you have an orgasm. If you do not give a damn, do it yourself.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20622","Marshall","I spent 18 years without a woman does not affect me. I can do it again.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20623","Lily","You will perhaps have to do it again.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20624","Ted (2030)","And I heard more than a bagpipe parade of St. Patrick.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20625","Marshall","I do not know what to do. We never had to fight so long. It's as if I no longer existed. Sunday morning, she made a pancake, Ted. A pancake and a slice of bacon.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20626","Ted","It's your fault. You took advice in love with Barney.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20627","Marshall","Well, maybe Barney was all inclusive. He and Ro-Ro are the best pair now. With Lily it was dethroned.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20628","Ted","You know, I do not believe all this stuff cute and adorable, it's not them. And I know for a fact that Robin hates nicknames.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20629","Ted","Thank you, Robbie Engineering.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20630","Robin","I do not like nicknames.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20631","Ted","You're finished with the sports page, Sherbs?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20632","Robin","Seriously, stop.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20633","Ted","It's T-Mose.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20634","Robin","I do not like with you either.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20635","Marshall","Apparently, she loves them now. And... come on, someone had to stop T-Mose.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20636","Ted","T-Mose was great. I think of the show.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20637","Marshall","The bagpipe seems different today. There was an echo.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20638","Ted","They're probably playing the bagpipes on the shower chair.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20639","Ted (2030)","And suddenly, I found how to get the real scoop on Barney and Robin.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20640","Barney","How will Marshall and Lily?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20641","Robin","Those two worry me, really.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20642","Barney","You and your big, huge heart.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20643","Ted","Enough. The game is over.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20644","Barney","What do you mean by that?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20645","Robin","Who, him?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20646","Ted","It's going to come. You see, I knew it was wrong. You two were too happy, too radiant, too ""surnomants"". It was not right.Never disputes? Crap. You argue all... the... time.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20647","Robin","How would you know that?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20648","Ted","Phil told me.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20649","Barney","Who the hell is Phil?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20650","Ted","Your downstairs neighbor.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20651","Man","I'm Phil. 12-B.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20652","Ted","And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20653","Barney","All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20654","Barney","I found at Marshall's arguments Lily were zero then it will never have to wash another dish. Slap me in two.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20655","Robin","It's your board that is zero.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20656","Barney","You're on the side of Lily? You... (The chairlift stops) No. We will argue and I can not spin.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20657","Robin","I can not undress. It's freezing here. I'll be hypothermic.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20658","Barney","Or so I tried the jump?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20659","Robin","Or just the pants?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20660","Barney","This trick of dodging is over?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20661","Robin","I think.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20662","Barney","You have the? This is the smallest!","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20663","Robin","They fight because of you!?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20664","Barney","And it does not stop there. We argue non-stop since.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20665","Robin","All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20666","Barney","The tie murdered by Robin.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20667","Robin","The hidden camera in the headboard.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20668","Barney","As a quarterback to stay on top. Monday morning, he sits on an ice pack and are studying the tape of the match.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20669","Robin","Barney for the millionth time...","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20670","Ted","I knew it! I knew you were too cute and perfect!","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20671","Barney","Look, we were fed up everyone to tell us how we are no relations.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20672","Robin","It was nice to be the ideal couple for one minute.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20673","Ted","I knew you were lying. Get up early for the feint-T Mose.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20674","Robin","Stop it.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20675","Lily","Marshall, dinner is ready.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20676","Marshall","You've done for me?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20677","Lily","No, but what is your favorite.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20678","Barney","We need advice.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20679","Ted (2030)","Robin and Barney told Lily and Marshall to their disputes. And let's just say, in comparison, their quarrels dishes seemed bland.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20680","Ted (2030)","And in the end, Lily and Marshall had the same reaction.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20681","Marshall","I'll do the dishes directly to my death.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20682","Lily","I do not care when you take out. But if it is made of cheese as a good ziti, do soak.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20683","Marshall","Sure, honey.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20684","Lily","I love you.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20685","Marshall","I love you too.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20686","Robin","You see? At the moment, how did you do to fix everything?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20687","Marshall","I do not know. Sometimes you just let his ego aside.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20688","Lily","And keep in mind that the love you have for that other person is more important than winning.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20689","Barney","More important than winning.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20690","Robin","Calm. Calm down. Seriously, what's the secret?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20691","Lily","The honeymoon phase may be over, but now you can get down to business. And honestly, it's the best part.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20692","Robin","Good night.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20693","Barney","What about now?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20694","Robin","I think we should talk about advantage and get down to business.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20695","Barney","Or, there is a bench in the elevator.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20696","Robin","That's better. It is not the best couple in the world, so what?","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20697","Barney","Grave. It's not a competition.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20698","Lily","We won!","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20699","Marshall","Best couple of the world!","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20700","Marshall","Guess what? These glasses are plastic. So you can throw them. So no dirty dishes in the sink.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20701","Lily","You're dirty. It is you who should be in the sink.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20702","Ted (2030)","And once the first fight set, all the others, well, they are also regulated.","05","06","Bagpipes"
"20703","Ted (2030)","Children, since I know your Uncle Barney, he has always had strong views on relationships.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20704","Barney","Your girlfriend? This is your girlfriend!? It is small and it's your friend? Do not humanize the enemy. But, delighted.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20705","Ted (2030)","And yet, in fall 2009, it was he who had a girlfriend.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20706","Barney","Come on. Open it. It's p0rn collection! Just kidding. It would be weird.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20707","Ted","It's your p0rn collection.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20708","Barney","This is my collection of p0rn! I offer you my p0rn. Now that it goes really well with Robin, I need more.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20709","Lily","Voluntarily, you abandon your p0rn...? You're really serious.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20710","Marshall","This is obvious.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20711","Barney","What does that mean?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20712","Marshall","Nothing, it's just, you know, you have love handles.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20713","Barney","What?! I have no love handles. This is ridiculous.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20714","Marshall","It's nothing. Once you're with someone, it is natural to let some go. Trust me. It's been there.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20715","Lily","He really is growing at a time.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20716","Barney","We gotta go. Goodbye, my dear friends. You were always there for me. We will miss you.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20717","Robin","He speaks to p0rn.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20718","Ted","Hi, Robin. A more.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20719","Robin","Hi.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20720","Lily","My God, matte videos. The orgy of space? The surprise party of 23 students naughty?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20721","Marshall","You'd think after 22 celebrations, students would no longer surprises.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20722","Lily","You can get rid of it.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20723","Ted","No, it's not a problem. I'll do it.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20724","Lily","Are you sure? It's nothing. We can go around back and throw the box in the trash.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20725","Marshall","I read six of the words you just said about this jacket.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20726","Ted","Seriously, this is nothing. I'm on it.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20727","Lily","Because...","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20728","Ted","Let them! In a sense, it's sad, right? Barney who abandons his p0rn. He has love handles. They eat the same thing every night. We are witnessing the end of Barney Stinson as we know it.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20729","Marshall","So what? They are happy.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20730","Lily","Let's go. A more.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20731","Marshall","So you're what?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20732","Lily","I Tail-Dalle.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20733","Marshall","What...? I thought I had seen in one take.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20734","Lily","Yeah. It's called Tail-Dalle.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20735","Ted","ArchiSexTure. That's not how you write ""Buckminster Fuller.""","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20736","Ted (2030)","Children, pornography is wrong, and when I got rid of that horrible pornography on the field...","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20737","Ted","I get rid of this horrible pornography on the field.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20738","Ted (2030)","There is something terrible happened.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20739","Voice","ArchiSexture.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20740","Barney","If you watch this tape, and I knew it... is that you are in possession of all my p0rn. It can only mean two things, either I'm dead or I'm in a committed relationship. If I died, I want you honor my memory by taking my body in the Hamptons and recreating Weekend at Bernie. I want to dance. I want to make love. And I want to go fishing. If, on the other hand, I'm in a relationship, as best friend, I have one favor to ask. Please, for God's sake, get me out of here!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20741","Barney","I can look happy, but do not believe it. Barney Stinson is suited for celibacy. (Marshall and Lily have joined Ted) Out of pity, if our best friends account... And yes, Marshall, I'm his best friend, how you take it? So, get me out of here. And finally, since you hoping to see some p0rn... (Barney turns the camera towards the bed where a woman waits) Do not worry. The green light means it is off.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20742","Lily","We're sure he had done?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20743","Ted","There is no reason to take it seriously, though?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20744","Lily","No, of course. This is an old tape. Barney is pleased with Robin.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20745","Ted (2030)","But over time I began to notice things. Barney and Robin have stopped their crazy adventures.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20746","Lily","So what you did last night?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20747","Robin","I wanted to go to a concert. Him at a party. We could obviously do what the other wanted, so we stayed to watch a movie on cable.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20748","Barney","It was Legen... wait... the Autumn. Legends of the Fall!It was fun.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20749","Ted (2030)","Barney stopped being himself.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20750","Ted","I spotted this girl there, and I will need help to land the plane.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20751","Barney","Sorry, I have my own way tonight.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20752","Ted (2030)","And Robin was annoyed when he opened his mouth.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20753","Lily","How do you go?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20754","Barney","Super. Relations are deadly...","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20755","Robin","Shut up...","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20756","Barney","Exchanges and compromise...","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20757","Robin","Shut up...","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20758","Barney","Monogamy is the best.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20759","Robin","Shut up.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20760","Barney","Tagline!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20761","Robin","Shut up.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20762","Ted (2030)","But it got worse... more","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20763","Barney","More hungry...","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20764","Ted (2030)","The more they said everything was fine. In truth, Barney and Robin had just let go. But after a few weeks for us, they looked like that.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20765","Barney","I can... in a minute.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20766","Ted","They kill.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20767","Lily","They love each other.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20768","Ted","Barney and Robin are in love, but they are more Barney and Robin. They are big and old.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20769","Marshall","My favorite cop show.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20770","Ted","This is obvious. Barney eats too much because he hates to lose his freedom. Robin and stress because she hates what has become Barney.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20771","Lily","They are perfect together.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20772","Ted","It might be the problem. They are too similar. It's hard to have two dominant in a relationship.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20773","Marshall","We are two dominant sets.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20774","Lily","Of course, my heart.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20775","Marshall","If they are not happy, why not break?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20776","Ted","They are too stubborn. Neither wants to be the first to admit he no longer wants. They play at first that deflates.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20777","Marshall","I think the first who plays Barney deflates.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20778","Lily","It's a bad time. It takes time to get used to each other. They are... How do you say ""selfish"" nicely?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20779","Lily","Independents. Every relationship goes through there.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20780","Marshall","It's true... I had a friend astronaut, totally in love with his fiancee. On the eve of her mission, she surprised him with four other girls and two guys. It has become intense. She ended up sneaking into the space shuttle...","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20781","Ted","Talk about Space Orgy?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20782","Marshall","Yeah.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20783","Lily","It's a bad time. Let us do things.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20784","Marshall","She's right.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20785","Lily","Two against one, Ted. Let them.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20786","Ted (2030)","I left them alone. But this weekend there...","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20787","Barney","Did you notice that the beef ribs were absolutely disgusting, but recently they have become delicious?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20788","Marshall","I'll get to the point, and ask you a question. Are you happy with Robin?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20789","Barney","Are you kidding?! How could I not be? It's Robin!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20790","Marshall","So you're happy?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20791","Barney","Can you ask me this question. We argue constantly, but you know what they say about relationships, ""Every moment is a battle.""","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20792","Marshall","So you're happy?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20793","Barney","And you know what happens right after a fight? Gender reconciliation. What is different... when you're in a loving and lasting relationship.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20794","Barney","Stack we make love, we order a pizza face and it stays there to moan.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20795","Robin","Okay. Decides that the piece.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20796","Barney","What was the pizza again?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20797","Robin","Face.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20798","Barney","It's face.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20799","Barney","s*x... I'm right? Fortunately, it is becoming rare. I'm still hungry. You're hungry?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20800","Marshall","We must break them. You're right. Barney and Robin are unhappy together but they are too stubborn to admit it. We must make the break.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20801","Ted","What next?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20802","Marshall","We will release... the Kraken.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20803","Ted (2030)","Children, as you know, earlier this year I learned that Lily had broken no one, not two, but seven of my past relationships.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20804","Lily","Forget. I took my retirement. I no longer.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20805","Marshall","But you're the best.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20806","Lily","I swear, I gave up these shots there. I became legit. I am now matchmaker.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20807","Ted","Find me someone.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20808","Lily","I just started.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20809","Marshall","Please. You've got to break. This relationship is killing them.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20810","Lily","I know, but I learned the lesson. I no longer interferes. I let things.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20811","Ted","It's two against one.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20812","Lily","But the one that's me.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20813","Ted","No need for it. We can do it alone.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20814","Marshall","How?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20815","Ted","When I was with Robin, you remember the only thing that made pinball?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20816","Robin","You do not have the right to do this to me.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20817","Ted","What are you talking?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20818","Robin","From this! That's what I mean. How does it feel in my champagne?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20819","Ted","If Robin thinks for one second that Barney wants to marry her, she Petera a lead and they will break.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20820","Marshall","That sucks. Why not let Barney be tempted by a sexy girl? (Barney wipes his hands on his shirt) Okay, going to the ring.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20821","Marshall","A surveillance van.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20822","Ted","What?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20823","Marshall","It should take one. We have ordered pizza, watched through binoculars and said, ""That's not why I signed,"" or stuff like that.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20824","Ted","The server arrives.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20825","Robin","Please, shut up.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20826","Barney","What?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20827","Robin","I thought you had mentioned, sorry. (The waiter brings them two glasses of champagne) This is an engagement ring?Are you...?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20828","Barney","No, this is not one. They had the wrong table. You can imagine we are married?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20829","Robin","We're committed to one another.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20830","Barney","Your business is already in my apartment.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20831","Robin","Easier for taxes.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20832","Barney","And for your naturalization.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20833","Robin","""Scherbatsky"" is hard to spell.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20834","Barney","My mother would be so happy.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20835","Robin","Yeah, I guess.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20836","Barney","No reason not to do so.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20837","Barney","We get married!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20838","Robin","Not so loud, sh1t.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20839","Lily","What did you do? I'm furious now. It will not?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20840","Robin","You will be my bridesmaid?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20841","Lily","Oh, my God! I'd love to!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20842","Lily","You have lost your mind? You knew they were playing that first deflates, and what? You give them an engagement ring!Okay, that's good. I care. I return to the center stage for a final rupture.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20843","Marshall","What next?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20844","Lily","They are up to their necks. A single argument will not suffice. We must revive the four largest arguments they've ever had, at one time. Number one, the battle of dirty dishes. Number two, the conflict of ex-girlfriends.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20845","Robin","You do not know any that girl over there?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20846","Barney","No, I do not think. (The woman bends down to pick something she brought down) No, actually, I do not know... This is Meg. I do not compare in my mind there. Can you pick me?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20847","Robin","Really?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20848","Lily","Number three, the altercation Star Wars.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20849","Robin","You're not a bit old for that stupid doll?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20850","Barney","It's not a doll. It's a stormtrooper.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20851","Robin","He wears a diaper.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20852","Barney","No, it's protective armor.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20853","Robin","A stormtrooper? Rather a storm-merdeur.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20854","Barney","Come on.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20855","Robin","It looks like your storm-merdeur the changes we need.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20856","Barney","You know, I'm sick.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20857","Robin","I said nothing.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20858","Barney","The jokes about magic, the stormtrooper...","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20859","Lily","And, of course, the biggest, the Canadian-American War.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20860","Barney","thank you God, the song is over. Who was the old devil who sang?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20861","Robin","You know Neil Young is my favorite musician.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20862","Barney","She was the wife of Archie in All in the family, or the same voice?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20863","Robin","Neil Young is a Canadian treasure. Do not make fun of Neil Young.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20864","Barney","I never make fun of an old lady paralyzed vocal cord...","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20865","Ted","I've found. I have found. They maile images reminding those fights.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20866","Lily","Poor kid. This is how it will happen. They are the restau... (Lily imagines the scene) First, it rekindles debate US-Canada, when Alan Thicke, a native of Ontario, going to their table.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20867","Ted","Alan Thicke?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20868","Marshall","Oh yes. Robin was known when she sang.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20869","Lily","They are always in contact. I had his number on the mobile Robin. Seriously... amateurs. (She plunges into the scene) So, Alan Thicke stimulus battle USA / Canada. Just then, Meg-the-crazy happens. Then, a stormtrooper happening in the street.And just when they are tired, a diver passes with a basin full of what? Dirty dishes.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20870","Ted","This is your masterpiece.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20871","Marshall","It takes a surveillance van!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20872","Marshall","A Break? Really? You have rented a station wagon?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20873","Ted","A van costs $ 25 more.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20874","Marshall","A Break?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20875","Robot","Greeting, Will Robinson! That a birthday?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20876","Lily","Get in the car.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20877","Ted","What is that thing?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20878","Lily","They did not stormtrooper so I had to take another robot. It will work also.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20879","Ted","Another robot? The stormtroopers are not robots.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20880","Lily","Of course they are robots! ""Must kill Luke Skywalker""","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20881","Ted","No one said this in Star Wars.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20882","Marshall","Very bad robot voice.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20883","Man","Someone ordered an extra large sausage?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20884","Ted","A film of Barney begins like that.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20885","Marshall","Barney Five... order something.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20886","Man","I do not know if everything will be back.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20887","Ted","Now you mention the movie.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20888","Marshall","It continues. The server supports a second sheet.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20889","Lily","We need it here. It is in hiding.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20890","Man","You dont need a van?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20891","Ted","A van is more expensive.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20892","Marshall","Thank you!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20893","Robot","Pass me a slice, Will Robinson!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20894","Ted","If you work the costume, they will pay us.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20895","Marshall","Stop and think only of money.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20896","Lily","Give a hand to the stormtrooper.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20897","Ted and Marshall","It's not a stormtrooper.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20898","Man 2","Sorry for the delay. I was looking for a van.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20899","Marshall","Thank you!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20900","Ted","$ 25!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20901","Man 2","I greet between Robin?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20902","Lily","No, go up. Wait... When they blew the Death Star with thousands of stormtroopers it was human?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20903","Marshall","It was the Death Star. They did not sign in the wind.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20904","Man 2","I do not want to play with celebrities, but I have a dinner tonight, so...","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20905","Man","Someone should take this sausage!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20906","Ted","You were in this video? The guy with the tan of a farmer?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20907","Robot","Many want pizza, Will Robinson!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20908","Man 2","Come on, I'm Alan Thicke!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20909","Man","That's not why I signed.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20910","Lily","You know what? Everyone, stop! Alan thicke, close it!Marshall is a break. Put-in-t. Ted, stop talking about p0rn. And for God's sake, give the pizza stormtrooper!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20911","Ted and Marshall","It's not a stormtrooper!","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20912","Lily","Damn! They see us.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20913","Marshall","You're sure they've seen us?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20914","Woman","I can go talk to Barney? I'm too excited. You really think he'll ask me to marry?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20915","Marshall","Forget it is located. If you try something, they'll know it's us. We should all go...","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20916","Lily","This is my masterpiece. And then they saw us? It will work anyway.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20917","Ted","Come on. We find something else.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20918","Alan","I repeat, I'm Alan Thicke.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20919","Woman","You are Alan Thicke?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20920","Lily","Alan Thicke, to you. Go ahead.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20921","Ted (2030)","So Lily went on with his plan. First, Alan Thicke.Followed by Meg-the-wild. Then the robot. And finally, the dirty dishes. But after all that...","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20922","Lily","They kiss? They should not! Why it does not work?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20923","Ted","Because they love.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20924","Marshall","It was a bad spot.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20925","Lily","What am I doing? All this was a mistake.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20926","Robot","So... it tells you to smoke joints?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20927","Ted","I thought that I would not say that this coir, but... Robin and Barney, the happy couple.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20928","Ted (2030)","This is when we learned that relationships are hard but ultimately, everything comes right.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20929","Lily","Where is Barney?","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20930","Robin","It was broken.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20931","Ted (2030)","And that's when we have forgotten the lesson they had learned ten seconds.","05","07","The Rough Patch"
"20932","Ted (2030)","You see, rather in the evening, when Lily was believed that Barney and Robin had spotted us, this is what they really saw.","05","07","The Rough Patch"

"21335","Lily","You've invited?!","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21336","Marshall","The poor man was sobbing. What could I do? A fool and called him a girl, what I found unjustified.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21337","Lily","I do not believe you. What gives you the right to do that?","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21338","Marshall","You and I are married. So it is also part of my family.(Marshall will open the door for the third time) Enter.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21339","Mickey","Ted, you should play quickly. Your gallbladder is about to explode.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"

"21343","Ted","Robin sh1t! I knew Barney first. This is for me to slap.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21344","Robin","This slap is mine, Mosby. I never slap Barney... above the belt.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21345","Ted","I want to slap Barney since I met him!","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21346","Robin","And I would not slap?","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21347","Ted","One second. This slap was supposed to be a wonderful thing, a gift, and it has turned against each other.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21348","Robin","My God, you're right. This fruit has changed in immaculate slap-poisoned apple. You know what? Seriously, do it.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21349","Ted","Are you sure?","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21350","Robin","Baffe-solument.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"

"21355","Ted","Yep. Go.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21356","Barney","I guess this is the best choice, Robin. Finally... the men are stronger than women.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21357","Ted","Do not listen. It's decided.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21358","Barney","And that's what you always wanted, is not it? A strong man to take care of you? Of course, teenager, you were a feisty, playing hockey with the boys, you skinned your knees on the ice. But what you could say to your teammates... or even to yourself... that is all you really wanted was this pretty white dress in this beautiful white chapel. And at the end of the aisle strewn with pretty white flowers, a man to take care of all your slaps.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21359","Robin","Leads to me!","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"

"21361","Mickey","Sorry, Ted. Explosion of the gallbladder. You stand back 3 spaces.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"

"21363","Mickey","Relax. This is not true of bile. It is of Chinese painting to lead. And bile horse.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21364","Ted (2030)","And at that time, Marshall is launching a look at Mickey none of us had ever seen.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21365","Mickey","What is it? It does what?","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21366","Ted","You have swallowed this painting?","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21367","Marshall","This is my look ""you're dead to me.""","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21368","Mickey","Yeah, Lily does it better...","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21369","Marshall","Get out of my house!","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21370","Marshall","In Mr. Park... I was not expecting to find you here. Lily, I'm sorry. Just let me express myself. I thought the family was right but it's wrong. It is a privilege, and it deserves it. I put your father out. And I promise you, baby, I do... you never force her to see him again. (Lily starts to cry) What? Baby, what has happened?","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21371","Lily","Marshall, I came here because I was cold and it was the only place that was open. I would not even look at Mr. Park in the eye. And then I discovered that... Mr. Park's death. He really died for me. And if I feel so bad to have never forgiven Mr. Park, a guy who literally did not mean anything to me? We have to get my father.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21372","Ted (2030)","And that's the way to Thanksgiving 2009, your aunt Lily was a miracle. (Lily and Marshall arrive at the door of their apartment, when Mickey's father, Lily, was released. She throws herself into his arms) It has brought a man to life.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21373","Marshall, tapping on a glass","Everyone. Before we begin, Barney, we'll need you on the throne of Baffe.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21374","Barney","Commissioner of the bet-Baffe, tie me to the chair is a violation...","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21375","Lily","Less talking shop, more slaps.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21376","Marshall","You just 2 minutes. You decided which of you will be entitled to a slap in the face to Barney?","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21377","Robin","It's gonna be Ted.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21378","Ted","What? Why me?","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21379","Robin","Last year you were abandoned at the altar. You lost your job. You did so along way. I am so proud of you, Ted. You deserve to slap someone in the face as hard as you can.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21380","Ted","Thank you.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21381","Barney","This is the worst.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21382","Ted","You just go through a break... and even though I know that you and Barney are remained on good terms, there is not a part of you, well hidden that wants to slap in the face?","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21383","Robin","Yes","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21384","Ted","I know.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21385","Barney","It's downright hell.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21386","Ted","Okay.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21387","Barney","It hurts!","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21388","Robin","I can not do it. I can not take that away from you, Ted.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21389","Ted","I do not either.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21390","Barney","thank you God.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21391","Robin","So, I want to move. Mickey?","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21392","Barney","No way!","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21393","Robin","I'm glad you and Lily try to fix things. You want to welcome into our family, I would like to offer you the slap.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21394","Mickey","Really? It's a bit weird for me, I just met Barney and I have nothing against him but how many times have we a chance to slap someone in the face?","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21395","Barney","Gently!","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21396","Mickey","I'm sorry. I can not do it.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21397","Barney","thank you God.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21398","Mickey","I know I have not been a good father.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21399","Barney","You're kidding me.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21400","Mickey","So for all dance recitals that I missed, for all the art exhibitions that I should attend... for the wedding that I was not able to offer you... I give you, to you This slap.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21401","Barney","No. No, no, no, no. It is the Commissioner of the bet-Baffe. It must remain impartial!","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21402","Lily","The Commissioner of the bet-Baffe says it's good.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"

"21406","Lily","I can not do it. Why I can not do it?","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21407","Marshall","Because... the slap did exactly what I hoped. It brought us together. And it forced us to recognize the weakness and at the same time the greatness in ourselves and in others.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21408","Barney","Stop your bullshit.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21409","Marshall","And so... there will not slap... of... today.","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"
"21410","Barney","This is the best Thanksgiving...","05","09","Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap"

"21445","Ted","It was the perfect girl next door. And still is. All the guys who meet Maggie fall madly in love with her. And that's the problem. Since I know her, she has been single for only three short windows of time.","05","10","The Window"
"21446","Ted","When she moved here and broke up with her boyfriend in college, I waited one month, not to go for the spare wheel. And the spare wheel well, he stayed two years. After their breakup, I have waited a week. Late again. She stayed with guys for 3 years.","05","10","The Window"

"21449","Ted","And now, a single and Maggie is available along the way to this bar right now. I made him take a taxi with a woman driver for there is no interaction with a man, so far.","05","10","The Window"

"21465","Maggie","Ooh, not even a little. I'll stick with Marshall and Lily, that's fine.","05","10","The Window"
"21466","Ted","Super. Sit down, put yourself at ease. Relaxed, everything is relaxed. Listen, you want me to find the perfect girl for you so all together, it's her. Do not let a guy to approach her. No server to take our order, clean the table, and if it ignites, I want a female firefighter to extinguish.","05","10","The Window"
"21467","Marshall","I think that emergencies are taking applications like that.","05","10","The Window"

"21943","Barney","We have the remains cremated. Its buttons have saved a sick jacket of the Upper East Side.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21944","Robin","Finally, you can abandon the quest for so-called sexy barmaid.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21945","Barney","No. My costume gave his life for this cause, and I do not should rest before these two... Well, it... Finally,... Be it mine.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21946","Ted","There is absolutely right.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21947","Lily","Who, the guy who kisses an urn full of ashes costume. This guy?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21948","Ted","What if Cindy is the woman I am to marry, and I give up?Farewell, elegant but cozy house in Westchester, with a reasonable loan that I can pay without ruining me. Goodbye, the two children raised in a strict but loving hand, finding the perfect balance between the father and friend. Adios, triplets Schnauzers, Frank Lloyd Wright and. The fact is, I do not give up either! (Ted gets up and kissed the urn of Barney before leaving) I do not know why I did that.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21949","Barmaid","Barney, sorry about your friend. Tell me about him.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21950","Barney","It was Italian. Classic, elegant. And my God he knew how to deal with women. They could not say no.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21951","Barmaid","How old was he?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21952","Barney","7 years. I miss him so much!","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21953","Barmaid","You should not be alone tonight. I will finish earlier.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21954","Barney","Thank you, old friend. You go on a good shot.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21955","Lily","Admit it, she is sexier than me. It will not hurt me.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21956","Marshall","I can not. You're sexier than she.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21957","Lily","That's a goddess! Her skin glows. Her legs are super long.And that ass? I do not mind having it, even on the head! That night, I admit, I thought about it a little more than once.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21958","Marshall","What do you...? Kind, you think she is sexier than me?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21959","Lily","I never said that.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21960","Marshall","You think so!","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21961","Lily","It's not comparable. She is younger than you.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21962","Marshall","I'm just, like, me, my friend, against it, its old.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21963","Robin","You two, the fact that it is not real sexy! She is sexy thanks to circumstances! Look.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21964","Marshall","I guess you also think she is sexier than me.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21965","Carl","What are you doing?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21966","Robin","What?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21967","Carl","You do not have the right to be there.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21968","Robin","Carl, listening. No. I do not want to leave. Mercy, mercy, do not force me to leave.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21969","Carl","You have to go. You have to go.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21970","Robin","I was someone there, behind! Everybody loved me.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21971","Ted","Can we talk?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21972","Cindy","My roommate is going out of the shower. Come into my room.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21973","Ted","I know the law prohibits us from going out together. But he also says ""Do not teach in having drunk"" and I do it all the time.The fact is... I really appreciate you. You're cute, funny. You write a thesis which is entitled, Foreign direct investment and intergenerational ties of consumption behavior. It's too sexy! I know it sounds crazy, but... I feel that our paths are supposed to meet, and... I do not want to miss meeting you.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21974","Cindy","I do not want it, me either.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21975","Ted","I gotta tell you, just by looking at your room, I know we have much in common.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21976","Cindy","Really?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21977","Ted","The Unicorns? Who will cut our hair When We're Gone? I thought I was the only one with this album.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21978","Cindy","This is my roommate. I borrowed.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21979","Ted","And that? After World T.C Boyle?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21980","Cindy","Birthday present... my roommate. I did not read it yet.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21981","Ted","You should. It is really good. And that? It is the height. You play the bass? Seriously, ask my friends. I have always said that my perfect woman... does not play bass, because that is clearly that of your roommate.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21982","Cindy","It is in a group.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21983","Ted","Damn, that's cool.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21984","Cindy","It's amazing. You chose the only three things that are here to my roommate.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21985","Ted","The group played shows your roommate or...?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21986","Cindy","Get out.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21987","Ted (2030)","Children, as you guessed, it was not the night I met your mother. Although I think I saw his foot. But I approached the meeting with the woman of my dreams. And your mother... She had recovered her yellow umbrella.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21988","Barney","It was so special, you know? We should observe a minute of silence. Followed by about 20 minutes of grunting.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21989","Barmaid","I'll help you feel much better. Let me refresh.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21990","Barney","Okay. Expected. No, this is not the bathroom. This is...","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21991","Barmaid","They are yours?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21992","Barney","I'm the suit-sitting for someone.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21993","Barmaid","Barney, you lied to me. You must choose immediately.Me... or costumes.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21994","Barney, singing and dancing in the street","I know what you're thinking, ""What Barney has been drinking? This girl was hot! ""I might have to do it, but I did not miss anything because there is something she is not. 10 would make me a lot, but I'd rather be on my 31. It is a fact that you can not deny. Nothing goes better than n'me costume! Imagine a world where men and women are perfectly well-dressed! The delivery man in suit and tie savate, this puppy in a cross! This guy with sideburns, this baby with a pacifier! This gendarmette deliciously beautiful. Nothing goes better than n'leur costume! A first officer that I can wear, they are oh so distinguished! The perfect trick to get me a girl with father issues, navy blue or black! (2 men get out of a store with a rack filled with costumes) spy on this perfect rack! I want to make guilis.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21995","Marshall, doing the same","Oh, really! Then answer these questions, I beg. What would you do if you had to choose between your suits and a pot of gold?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21996","Barney","Costumes!","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21997","Marshall","What would you say, against all your costume you were offered eternal youth?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21998","Barney","Costumes!","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"21999","Robin","What would you choose  a million girls and one three parts?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"22000","Barney","Do we see.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"22001","Lily","And a world at peace would be within your reach?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"22002","Barney","I'll stop. These are the costumes. Stops just bullshit.Two, three, four! Girls come and depart, but the clothes remain constant! Each buddy dépote and rambling, it is no substitute!Sorry, my costumes, I give you my life. My Sunday clothes are my best friends! The casual clothes go in the basket because nothing goes better with the undisputed often praised, claiming to fame... a true... Expect more... Costume...","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"22003","Ted, Marshall, Lily","Nothing suits her better... than... Costume.In costume! In costume! Costume...!","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"22004","Barney","Mind you, it is rather barrel. (Back at Barney) I choose you you, baby. Tomorrow morning, I get rid of these costumes.","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"22005","Barmaid","Really?","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"22006","Barney","Yeah. (They kiss) I will do you nothing!","05","12","Girls Versus Suits"
"22007","Ted (2030)","Children, when you're 30 and live in New York, there are few places where it is better not to be. Time Square at New Year, Christmas at Rockefeller Center, but the worst  a student bar!","05","13","Jenkins"
"22008","Ted","You're not serious, my students are going to catch me so I do them a lesson. I have not even my slide projector.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22009","Marshall","Ted, I'm champion of skee-ball, since law school. I have come here at least once a month to keep my record.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22010","Ted","Looks like you're not income from a lease, a guy called ""Big caramel"" you're passed.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22011","Marshall","Yes, yes.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22012","Ted","And you're ""Big caramel.""","05","13","Jenkins"
"22013","Marshall","The biggest. In fact, I must tell you something. I invited Jenkins.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22014","Ted (2030)","We have heard of Jenkins few weeks ago.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22015","Marshall","You will not believe what Jenkins has done this time.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22016","Ted","Who is Jenkins?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22017","Lily","This is a new lawyer in the office of Marshall, he is hilarious.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22018","Marshall","Hilarious! There was a jar of cherries in the fridge, then Jenkins said  $ 200 and I eat the whole pot. So we gave him $ 200, and he ate the whole jar!","05","13","Jenkins"
"22019","Ted (2030)","And the stories continued.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22020","Marshall","The CFO comes to sign papers, then Jenkins said  Excuse me Mr Wilkocs, I think we forgot one of the documents.We all went to a bar after work, Jenkins goes on the table and begins to gesticulate like a stripper, and a second later, he removes his shirt. It was so disgusting.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22021","Ted","Well it feels good to finally meet the famous Jenkins, after all these stories.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22022","Barney, joining them","And there's going to have another. I'll sleep with Jenkins.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22023","Ted","What?!","05","13","Jenkins"
"22024","Barney","You heard me.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22025","Ted","You want to sleep with Jenkins?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22026","Barney","With Jenkins, of Jenkins, near Jenkins. You said it, I want to put like a sock.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22027","Ted","But you are... really... I did not know that...","05","13","Jenkins"
"22028","Woman","Hi, guys.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22029","Marshall","Ted Jenkins here.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22030","Ted","It's going to seem crazy, but I thought Jenkins was a guy.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22031","Marshall","What!? Where did you get it?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22032","Ted","I do not know, maybe history  Jenkins pissed out the window of a taxi.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22033","Marshall","Yes, even more impressive now, right?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22034","Ted","Yes.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22035","Marshall","Ok, I confess! It all started a few weeks.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22036","Man","In fact the myopic! New lawyer, Jenkins here. Watch out for this guy, he steals things.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22037","Marshall","I do not steal. And I do not wear glasses. Marshall.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22038","Jenkins","Hi Marshall. So you're really a fan of the Vikings, or he lied about that too?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22039","Marshall","Why? It's a trap, you're a fan of the Packers? My wife knows I'm here. She has no money, however it has very special skills.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22040","Jenkins","I'm a fan of the Vikings too! I think purple and gold. I am from Pelican Rapids.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22041","Marshall","Pelican Rapids? My grandfather lives there. Finally he's dead now, but it haunts a bar on a road.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22042","Ted","Wait, if you tell me that you flirt with a woman other than yours, I'll pull out and hit you.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22043","Marshall","First, you can not control the Grand caramel. Secondly, I see it as a big brother, who has breasts. My older brother had also, in short.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22044","Marshall","That night, I spoke to Lily.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22045","Lily","I'm in a hurry to meet him.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22046","Marshall","I should correct, it would have been so simple.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22047","Marshall","But I have not done. So now, whenever I talk about Jenkins, I avoid pronouns.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22048","Marshall","So the manager comes to marketing staff to choose Midwest. So he, he, he, she, him, him, Jenkins, him, her.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22049","Ted","Look, I understand why you have not told him? You really think she would be jealous too.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22050","Marshall","Ted, think of the stories I've told.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22051","Ted","Yes, it could be a problem.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22052","Marshall","Exactly, that's why Lily can know nothing.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22053","Robin","Lily can know nothing of what?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22054","Ted","What Marshall is going to buy a horse.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22055","Robin","Really?! It's great, I love this stuff. Guys why this kid staring at me? I understand, I think it happens at last. I recognized my show.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22056","Ted","That's so cute. But it's Scotty, one of my students, and he looks at me me. Weird that I'm more famous than you.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22057","Robin","No, I go on TV.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22058","Ted","And I have 30 students in my class, which means, go, 30 times your hearing. We're going to buy Scotty a drink for old teacher. Scotty then, a question on neoclassical architecture, and it's good.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22059","Scotty","You are Robin Scherbatsky, right?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22060","Ted","What?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22061","Robin","Yes.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22062","Scotty","I did not want to fix, it's just that I watch your show all the time.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22063","Robin","Really?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22064","Ted","Really?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22065","Scotty","Bluntly. Why do you hang out with Ted?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22066","Ted","Uh, this is Professor Mosby.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22067","Robin","We're friends.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22068","Scotty","The cow! Robin Scherbatsky is friends with my art teacher.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22069","Ted","This is architecture. Go will study.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22070","Scotty","And a second, you're ""Big caramel""?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22071","Ted","Go!","05","13","Jenkins"
"22072","Marshall","Hello?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22073","Lily","Hey baby, I go up there.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22074","Marshall","What, why?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22075","Lily","There was a problem at school, it was therefore the day. I thought to visit you, eat something with a nice little dessert.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22076","Marshall","I have a problem, it was my wife. The first time I spoke to you, she thought you were a man, so...","05","13","Jenkins"
"22077","Jenkins","... then you're afraid she became insane upon learning that I am a woman.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22078","Marshall","Absolutely.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22079","Jenkins","Good God, I was in a band improv. Am what I do.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22080","Lily","Hello, I'm Lily, Marshall's wife.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22081","Jenkins","Hi Lily, I am of the French Embassy. I am here because of a little problem with cheese but important.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22082","Marshall","It is Jenkins.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22083","Lily","You are Jenkins?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22084","Jenkins","Yes, well, uh, I'll let you sort it out between you, see you later.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22085","Ted (2030)","Marshall cracked. The moment he feared.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22086","Lily","The famous Jenkins, gosh. I imagined a man, in short, we eat?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22087","Marshall","Wait, you're not jealous at all?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22088","Lily","Honey, I do not have to worry about you and another woman.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22089","Marshall","Because we love to madness, right?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22090","Lily","Yes of course. Let's eat.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22091","Marshall","It was not jealous at all.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22092","Ted","Of course she was not jealous, it is the dynamics of your relationship.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22093","Marshall","What is this supposed to mean?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22094","Robin","That's how it goes boy, every relationship has a low and high.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22095","Ted","Exactly, low in trying to conquer another out of reach, and the strong will go back down to be with the other person less.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22096","Marshall","I am not diminished for Lily. Yes, it is a bit small, and my mother says she has no hips to carry a baby Eriksen. My God, you think I'm weak.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22097","Robin","That's why Lily is not jealous. The strongest is never jealous because where could go lower? The fort, Lily, is the best thing that low, Marshall may have hoped.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22098","Marshall","No, ok, I'm glad Lily, but Lily is as lucky as me. None of us is low.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22099","Robin","Yes, it's definitely, you are going to buy a horse.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22100","Marshall","What?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22101","Robin","Try your luck.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22102","Ted","So, to end modern architecture is very short, experimented with the houses in V. (Robin enters the classroom Ted) Excuse me one second. What are you doing here?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22103","Robin","I've realized that you forgot something this morning, so I thought I would bring thee  thy pen.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22104","Ted","It's your pen, and you have chewed the end, recently.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22105","Robin","Nothing to Ted, your course was on my way to work.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22106","Ted","No, it is not.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22107","Robin","Come on, stand New York.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22108","Student","I watch your show all the time.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22109","Robin","Really, you watch my show? You flatter me see. Other fans here?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22110","Ted","Thank you for last, Robin.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22111","Robin","That night, great show on poisons. (She goes out, then reopens the door) Also, who makes the worst pizza in New York, I will give you information on traffic streets 5 and 9.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22112","Ted","Really? You watch his show? It's like watching an aquarium lit, and less interesting. And now that I think, not even informed.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22113","Scotty","The truth is that we look for the drinking game.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22114","Ted","The what?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22115","Student","As the show starts early, it is often at the bar. So when she did an interview, one should drink when she says ""But um"".","05","13","Jenkins"
"22116","Barney","But huh?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22117","Ted","But um, it would seem, she often said.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22118","Barney","It's funny, I also had a drinking game based on Robin, Robin finally. At the bottom of her stomach...","05","13","Jenkins"
"22119","Ted","It was agreed that you do not speak of those things.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22120","Barney","Sorry, you're right. She did not like anyway. She said it woke her up. Does she said ""But um"" so often?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22121","Ted (2030)","Tonight, we saw how much she often said.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22122","Robin","It's good but um, this was not your first spelling bee, does not it?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22123","Boy","No, the third.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22124","Robin","Oh that's good. But hmm. But um...","05","13","Jenkins"
"22125","Marshall","Interesting article in the newspaper. They say that in every relationship there is a weak and strong.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22126","Lily","Let me see.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22127","Marshall","It's not that one, it's in another, I've read before. The newspaper reminded me of the old. In short, what do you think?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22128","Lily","I think sometimes it's the case.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22129","Marshall","But not for us?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22130","Lily","No, of course not.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22131","Marshall","Sure. Imagine, you have a gun to his head, you have to say that one of us is low.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22132","Lily","I would say this is me, this is what is right.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22133","Marshall","Now, the gun is pointed at me, and our future children, and our future little monkeys. Depends on who wins the game is played for 3 years.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22134","Lily","No, no weak or strong.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22135","Marshall","So this...","05","13","Jenkins"
"22136","Ted (2030)","It went on for a while, until finally...","05","13","Jenkins"
"22137","Marshall","Our two children, our 8 grandchildren, 11 great grandchildren our, our plane piloted by Oprah, and it is poised to spits at an art museum that contains all your favorite pictures, and the only way save everything, and answered  Art thou the weak or strong?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22138","Lily","And Oprah has tried everything?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22139","Marshall","Everything you need to decide now.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22140","Lily","I think if I had to really say, maybe I'm strong.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22141","Marshall","How can you say such a thing!","05","13","Jenkins"
"22142","Marshall","She thinks she is strong. That's right, I have to prove that I am not the weak. I will make her jealous.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22143","Barney","Easy, that's the plan  A, layer with Jenkins. Two, I sleep with Jenkins first. Three, the second rule is the first I'm going to rule 2.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22144","Ted","Okay, I know. You remember the other night, the game of skee-ball, when you did your good score?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22145","Marshall","Yes, an ordinary night for the ""Big caramel.""","05","13","Jenkins"
"22146","Marshall","Do you think she was flirting with me?","05","13","Jenkins"
"22147","Ted","Bluntly.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22148","Marshall","Sure, I have an opening. If Madame Lily is jealous, young Marshall can not move, then by chance, the ""Big caramel""... may move, ok let me try again.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22149","Ted","Okay, I understand.","05","13","Jenkins"
"22150","Robin","Ted, I have a great idea.","05","13","Jenkins"

"22219","Marshall","And if you got no time for all this, just tell him that it happened and that you're sorry. And if you're really in a hurry did not tell him you're sorry. Just as it happened, what is most important. It really happened. Thus abbreviated it as much as you can.","05","13","Jenkins"

"22229","Ted","No, no, no, please. Just goes away!","05","13","Jenkins"
"22230","Robin","I just wanted to tell you go... (She takes a megaphone) To all those watching. Go! Standing New York! BUT HUM!","05","13","Jenkins"
"22231","Ted (2030)","There are ways to relieve stress.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22232","Woman","You'll have a few minutes, Mr. Stinson.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22233","Ted (2030)","Many people bite their nails. Others tap their feet.And others imagine themselves to be interviewed by renowned sports commentator Jim Nantz.","05","14","Perfect Week"

"22235","Barney","Thank you, Jim. I'm glad to be back on the show.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22236","Jim","It's good to have you. And you know, the statistics, they really speak for themselves. Over 200 women spread over 6 continents, 17 countries, 74 sexual positions, and not a single bead. Impressive. But even with all these successes, there has always been an escape for you. Which brings us back to last week. Tell us about our history.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22237","Barney","Hold on, Jimbo, it is extraordinary.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22238","Barney","It all started when I decided to start a small challenge.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22239","Marshall","Oh my God. Wow.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22240","Ted","He decides his victim.","05","14","Perfect Week"

"22243","Robin","Hi!","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22244","Lily","How did it go with Dale?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22245","Robin","You know, sometimes, the guy with thick glasses and a t-shirt of the Smurfs, it's just a cliche. And sometimes it is a moron with a squint and a platonic relationship with Gargamel.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22246","Lily","Robin, this is not because a guy talks a lot about a fictional character for your first date it can not be your future.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22247","Marshall","The Yeti is not fictitious.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22248","Ted, from seeing Barney","That was fast.","05","14","Perfect Week"

"22254","Marshall","How do you know he'll call?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22255","Robin","How cute, Marshall. But I think mom knows when she was a hit. I mean, he could not help but look at me.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22256","Ted","And well, do not push too. People can be fragile. And sometimes, without even trying, you can tear someone's heart, and crush it in front of a roomful of 26 people and a teacher's assistant.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22257","Lily","How it happened at school today, Ted?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22258","Ted","Something bad happened. This was the first course of the semester...","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22259","Ted","Jamie Adamic. Salvation. Brian Glow-atz. Glau-atz?Salvation. Well done. Add a false name on the call sheet, very original guys.

"22268","Lily","We will not make jokes, Ted. I mean, this girl must really be in the hole.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22269","Marshall","You really soiled the name of Jen Coulin.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22270","Ted","Have you finished?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22271","Robin","You asked him if she had reached the right exit?","05","14","Perfect Week"

"22278","Jim","I believe it. You are awesome. Now, night 3. Describe it to us.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22279","Barney","Jim, I can tell you that I was gone, so I wanted a little spice.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22280","Barney","I think I'll take small tits tonight.","05","14","Perfect Week"

"22288","Marshall","There is no such Bizarros who share everything.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22289","Robin","Of course I do.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22290","Ted","That's exactly what you are.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22291","Lily","It is perfectly normal.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22292","Robin","What's happening guys?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22293","Marshall","You know, Lily and I was looking for a new couple of friends since we lost Robin and Barney, and Ted and Stella and Ted and Robin, and Ted... Ted and Victoria, when do you arrive to keep one?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22294","Ted","How we came up with that?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22295","Lily","It was a great day out at 4 it was cool, we were relaxed, it was not freaked out.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22296","Marshall","And there, a tiny detail has surfaced, and it ruined the whole evening.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22297","Man","... and the toothbrush Joanna is ejected from the sink, facing the ceiling, and falls straight down the toilet.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22298","Marshall","It's crazy that last week, it happened the same with our toothbrushes.","05","14","Perfect Week"

"22310","Ted","Yuck? Are you kidding? There is no one left to do...","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22311","Marshall","Do not tell! You're going to jinx him!","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22312","Lily","Wear what bad luck?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22313","Barney","I had left to do... flawless.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22314","Barney","It was faultless. 7 nights, 7 girls, 0 rejection.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22315","Jim","Awesome. I mean, it's the equivalent of sexual perfect game in baseball, in even harder.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22316","Barney","Yeah. The only player in history to have accomplished both Pete was Drexell 'The mustache' in 1896.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22317","Jim","It was not the first time you were about to accomplish. So you knew that one mistake, and we reach the end. Sometimes a teammate makes a mistake. Sometimes a minefield...","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22318","Barney","You and me in the closet of the Spanish supermarket next door.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22319","Jim","... takes you straight into the wall. And sometimes you spread yourself. And it almost always ends badly. But this week, you were to 3 of 3, and no sign of abating.","05","14","Perfect Week"

"22394","Ted","Great. What really happened?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22395","Barney","I ate at the ""Staten Island Chili's,"" and I jumped a hairdresser completely stuffed. Are you happy, Ulysses?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22396","Lily","Barney, we know that you are going you may get fired. Wait, you ought to speak. You turn away from reality, kissing unnecessarily on all sides.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22397","Barney","No vain, ok? Between number 5 and I, there was a connection. She will resume her studies, she has a child or who is studying... something with ""studies"".","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22398","Ted","Now my students have taught me that Jen Coulin abandon my material.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22399","Marshall","Oh, my God, you've really pushed to the limit.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22400","Robin","It scales all his education in the toilet.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22401","Ted","News from Dale?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22402","Robin","It's only been five days, he will call!","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22403","Marshall","What do you care? You said it was a big con.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22404","Robin","Tell Dale not like that, ok? It is twice as good as you never will!","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22405","Lily","God forbid, if you manage to find a job, sell your apartment.Marshall and I, we have a free room. You can stay as long as you want.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22406","Robin","Forget not you bring your toothbrush.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22407","Ted","Lily, what are you doing?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22408","Lily","I talk to my friend who is going through a difficult period.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22409","Marshall","He's doing very well.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22410","Lily","Try to sleep with seven women in seven nights, that's not what I would call ""very well get out."" It is a cry for help.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22411","Ted","His whole life is a call for help. But we do not mess with a man who is in the midst of a no...","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22412","Lily","What? Without fault? Flawless, faultless, flawless! Grow up a little!","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22413","Jim","Unbelievable. You know, there are two things that do not.First  you do not open an email from Phil Simms to your children.And second  you do not wear bad luck to a man on track to flawless.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22414","Barney","I do not know what to tell you, Lily is always trying to ruin me any.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22415","Jim","I think she cracked a bit for the Barnacle.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22416","Barney","You have the eye to notice such details, Jim Nantz.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22417","Ted","I can not believe that thou hast brought him bad luck.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22418","Marshall","He has no chance.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22419","Lily","Ok, I have a question. If I ruined everything, why is it that Barney is in the process of hanging the girl three martinis in there?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22420","Ted","Oh, my God!","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22421","Marshall","There's going to happen!","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22422","Lily","Yeah, you know? Doors-jinx, it does not exist.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22423","Jim","Do not tell me that she dared to say ""The door-jinx, it does not exist.""","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22424","Barney","I wish I had power.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22425","Jim","You were about to achieve something so beautiful.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22426","Barney","Well, thank you to her, the only thing that can prevent a stroke insured was about to walk out the door. A member of the New York Yankees World Champions in 2009.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22427","Marshall","Lily, I'll buy my own toothbrush.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22428","Ted","Well, that's it. Barney's still got to 6.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22429","Robin","What? Why? Because the guy with the weird cut went back?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22430","Marshall","This is Nick Swisher. It is part of the New York Yankees. No regular guy from New York can not compete with a Yankee.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22431","Ted","And this is true for a former Yankee. When I arrived here, I was the fourth date with a girl I loved a lot before I do the fly by Phil Rizzuto.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22432","Marshall","I was there. Damn, this guy could play.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22433","Robin","I'm still not.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22434","Lily","Ok, let me do it the Canadian So how do you react if one of those guys with skates and sticks came back here?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22435","Robin","Lily, if one of the Vancouver Canucks came here, I fall on my ass so that there would be a hole halfway to China in the soil.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22436","Ted","It's the same thing for the Yankees.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22437","Robin","Oh, Barney's done.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22438","Marshall","It's happening, look.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22439","Barney","You wanna come to my house and watch the collection of snowballs?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22440","Marshall","A collection of snow globes?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22441","Ted","He is pinball.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22442","Woman","It's Nick Swisher!","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22443","Overall","Nice try.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22444","Ted","It was well played, well played, well played.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22445","Barney","But not play well enough. All this week was a waste of time. And tomorrow I'm getting fired.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22446","Marshall","I'm sorry. But for what it's worth, this week was not a waste of time. We all had a horrible week, and you have helped us change a little air.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22447","Ted","Yeah, I got my first drop.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22448","Robin","I met my soul mate, and he never called back. Well, not yet. He will. He will.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22449","Marshall","We frightened a couple great just because we share a toothbrush.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22450","Barney","You share a toothbrush?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22451","Robin","Well, they and Ted.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22452","Barney","... Huh?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22453","Ted","Wait a minute. When we went out together, you borrow the toothbrush all the time.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22454","Robin","Oh, sh1t.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22455","Ted (2030)","And that's when Aunt Lily has seen what is great about sport, they make you forget about your problems, but only for a little while. And deep within us, we all needed this flawlessly.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22456","Ted","At the second she sits next to Swisher, we reach the end.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22457","Marshall","Wait a minute! Aldrin was seen. She tries to escape, she jumps, and... I thought she would not do that.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22458","Woman","Oh my God, are you?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22459","Lily","Yeah, sorry. I'm so clumsy! Oh, thank you. I think I twisted my ankle. Do what you can bring me some ice?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22460","Woman","Sure.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22461","Marshall","She did! I believe that there is no jinx finally.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22462","Wendy","I'm bringing ice, Lily.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22463","Marshall","Damn. Swisher is back in play Swisher is back in play!","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22464","Ted","Follow me. Hey, Nick Swisher! This guy and his wife share a toothbrush!","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22465","Nick","And?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22466","Ted","And it's weird, right?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22467","Nick","Actually, I think it's cute. Are we not try to find someone who could share his toothbrush?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22468","Marshall","I'm sorry. Lily, Nick Swisher think it's cute.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22469","Barney","Martini?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22470","Ted","You take a beer with a Yankee, if that's not cool!","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22471","Robin","That's great, I'm all baseball. Mookie Wilson, while a player eh?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22472","Nick","Yeah, baseball is great, but I tell you, this is not hockey.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22473","Robin","I live just above.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22474","Woman","What do you say we go home?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22475","Barney","Wow, to be honest, this is not my habit, but I feel a real connection, Number 7... Christy. I beg you. I did it! I did it!","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22476","Jim","Unbelievable. Congratulations on your faultless.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22477","Barney","Thank you, Jim. I would never have done it without the help of my friends.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22478","Jim","Hey, on another subject, you really think you could get fired today?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22479","Barney","Uh, Jim, I told you I wanted to talk about it.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22480","Jim","Barney, I go straight from your imagination, so apparently we must talk! Think about it.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22481","Barney","What a c**t.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22482","Jim","You're the idiot.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22483","Woman","Mr. Donovan will see you now.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22484","Mr Donovan","Stinson, we made a decision. We keep you. I know this last week has been hard.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22485","Barney","I barely slept.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22486","Marshall","That's the guy, the official caps of no fault of Barney. I was going to make t-shirts, but you know, sizes, all that, and it would hurt me to think.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22487","Lily","In commemoration, at the entrance to the Barney legend, this tie, worn during his seventh night of her flawless, freshly removed.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22488","Marshall","May the heroic story of Barney to be remembered, and transmitted from generation to generation.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22489","Ted","I already see myself in front of my children, trying to tell them when their uncle Barney kissed 7 chicks in a row.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22490","Ted (2030)","Is what I'm a bad father?","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22491","Wendy","A command to Coulin Jen? It has a large commission for Jen Coulin here.","05","14","Perfect Week"
"22492","Ted","You send Wendy to say now? Go! It's good, I understood.Jen Coulin is a crap name, and it becomes increasingly shitty when it is repeated. Jen Coulin. Jen Coulin. Jen Coulin.","05","14","Perfect Week"

"22494","TV anchor","""Welcome back to Superbowl XLIV in Miami. Get a load of that guy! You think that's his real number?""","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22495","Ted","Well, that explains where Barney is.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22496","Robin","Dibs on his wings!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22497","Barney","Hey, guys!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22498","Ted","Hey!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22499","Barney","Does anyone know who won the Superbowl?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22500","Marshall","You were there. It was the...","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22501","Barney","I won! Because I'm now in possession of a magic phone that always rings. And you know who's always usually on the other end? A chick. So how many chicks do I have calling me now? Infinity! Guys, remember Ranjit?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22502","Ranjit","Hello.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22503","Ted","Hey, Ranjit!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22504","Marshall","Good to see you.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22505","Barney","OK I've enlisted Ranjit's services as my personal driver because for the next week I'll be sleeping with hundreds of women and I don't want to take the subway cause... you know... germs!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22506","Ted","Wait, you're... you're actually gonna hook up with these girls that call you?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22507","Barney","Oh, indubitably! I'm meeting the first one here any minute. Keep your eyes pealed for a red sweater. Based on her texts, she's dirty, dyslexic and want to 96 me, semi-colon and parenthesis.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22508","Ted","This ought to be good. I can only imagine the quality of girls...","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22509","Red-sweater girl","Hi, you ARE the guy from the Superbowl.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22510","Barney","Magic phone, guys. (whispers) Magic phone!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"

"22512","Lily","Hey.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22513","Marshall","How's it going?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22514","Ted","That beer looks a little flat.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22515","Robin","Nuh, it's scotch.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22516","Ted","Something troubling you, kiddo?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22517","Robin","Hhhhh Don.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22518","Don","Oh yeahh!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22519","Robin","Now that's what I call having a woof over your head. Don. DON?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22520","Don","Why is ""Ulee's Gold"" in every crossword? On to me? Sorry, sorry... Next Sunday is Valentine's Day. And one lucky patient will be receiving a very special chocolate heart  a human heart. OK, that reminds me, I've been meaning to ask you... Robin, do you have any Valentine's Day plans?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22521","Lily","He asked you out?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22522","Robin","He asked me out.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22523","Ted","That's crazy! And they use ""Ulee"" because of the vowels.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22524","Marshall","What did you say?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22525","Robin","Well we were on the air, I was on the spot, so I said OK.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22526","Lily","Oh, oh, oh!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22527","Marshall","Robin, you're gonna marry this man so freaking hard, right in the butt.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22528","Robin","What? Nooo I HATE Don. And now I can't cancel because I said I would go out with him on the air.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22529","Marshall","What would your viewers think?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22530","Ted","Wow wow wow, you said you'd go out with him on Valentine's? I thought we had plans!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22531","Robin","Getting drunk and cleaning the apartment was a plan?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22532","Ted","I did NOT...say... it was a good plan.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22533","Barney","Guys, guys, guys, we're on me now. And it is getting in-teh-resting. Looks at these texts. Read this one. Yowza! Now look at this one. Does she text her mother with those fingers? Now look at this one... or this one, or this one, or this one, or...","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22534","Ted","OK OK OK buddy, how about you do this? Go nail that girl, then read your texts.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22535","Barney","I can't do that, Ted. I just can't hook up with a girl if there is a hotter girl out there with whom up can be hooked.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22536","Lily","Isn't there always a hotter girl?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22537","Barney","I know, isn't it wonderful? (answers phone) Go for Barney. Cut to the chase, what's your cup size?...Oh, hi Mom!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22538","Ted","So there's a hotter girl. Isn't that the problem in a nutshell? There's too many options. You got internet dating, you got bars...","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22539","Lily","Holding up your phone number on national TV.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22540","Ranjit","I never had that problem. When I was 18, I had an arranged marriage. And I love my wife more and more every day.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22541","Ted","Hm.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22542","Marshall","It is true. It's very rare that two people just meet and fall madly in love... like Robin and Don.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22543","Robin","Oh but we're not even like going out for dinner, we're just hanging out at his place.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22544","All of them","Ooohhh ahh!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22545","Robin","No, it's not like that. It's just us and a bunch of other people.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22546","All the them","Wooooooo!... (then they stop and think)","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22547","Lily","Wait, Robin, what exactly did Don say when he asked you out?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22548","Don","I'm having some friends over at my place for a party. You should come by if you want.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22549","Robin","Errrrrrr...I... OK.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22550","Lily","Robin, Don didn't ask you out.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22551","Robin","Err, of course he asked me out.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22552","Ted","Err no he didn't.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22553","Robin","Yes, he did. He did. He did. He DID!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22554","Ranjit","OK.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22555","Marshall","Well, dog my cats! I think I know what's going on here. Robin... did you WANT Don to ask out?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22556","Robin","Whaaat?!! (in a high voice) (huffs) Nooo, I HATE Don! I-I-I can't stop thinking how much I hate him, it's like, it's like... all the time. I just wanna attack him and rip his stupid clothes off and spank him with his little paddle until his bum's all red. SHUT UP!! (leaves the table)","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22557","Ted","See! That right there is what free will gets you. Constant ego-shattering uncertainty. I'm done with that. I want what Ranjit has. I've spent my entire adult life looking for the perfect woman and I'm spending Valentine's Day scrubbing the toilet. I need someone else to find me that woman. Marshall, Lily, arrange-marriage me!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22558","Barney","(walks by, phone ringing)Or this one, or this one, or this one...","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22559","Marshall","You want us to arrange your marriage?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22560","Ted","Absolutely. Looks there's two sides to dating, right? Picking and getting picked. Getting picked, I'm good at. Ladies looove Teddy Westside.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22561","Marshall","You're waiting for me to comment on your self-assigned nickname? Well, here's my comment. I love it.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22562","Ted","Really?! (excited)","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22563","Marshall","Teddy Westside? Continue.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22564","Ted","It's the picking, I suck at. I pick the wrong girls. But you guys, you're the best pickers I know. You picked each other.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22565","Lily","Oh well with the slight assist from the Wesleyan housing department.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22566","Marshall","And a healthy splash of Drakkar Noir. (they hive five) (Robin giggles)","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22567","Ted","Get out there and find me a girl. We'll double date on Valentine's Day. If I like her, I will marry her... if she's cool with it. And she will be. Cause I'll wear my nice blazer.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22568","Marshall","I love that blazer. Almost as much as Robin loves Don.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22569","Robin","I do not love Don.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22570","Marshall","Robin, neurologically speaking, the part of the human brain that makes you hate people is located right next to the part of the brain that makes you want to jump people's bones. The two responses are so similar, it's hard to tell them apart.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22571","Ted","You know what it's like? Wait, I have to get a book. Give me 30 seconds.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22572","Ted","OK this is fun. Look at this picture. It's a rabbit! You can look at it for hours and be absolutely sure it's a rabbit. But then one day, you look at it and you realize, ""wait a second, it's a duck!"" Rabbit, duck, rabbit, duck. Isn't it fun?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22573","Marshall","Relationships are like that. I mean, look, when you first met Don, you hated him, you thought ""This guy's a duck"", but one of these days you're gonna realize ""This is actually someone that I love, he's a rabbit"".","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22574","Ted","Wow I think you got it backwards there, buddy. The duck is the thing you love, the rabbit is the thing you hate.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22575","Marshall","What?!!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22576","Robin","Yeah I got to agree. Duck's up, rabbit down.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22577","Lily","Definitely. Ducks are better than rabbits.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22578","Marshall","I got... ducks are... ducks are... rabbits are adorable. Ducks are aargh. Have you ever been in a fight with a duck? I mean, ducks are... jerks.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22579","Ted","Duck is delicious. Rabbit is all gamey.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22580","Marshall","(yelling) We're not talking about flavour, Ted.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22581","Ted","(yelling as well) Flavour counts.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22582","Marshall","Who carries a duck's foot for good luck? Anyone?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22583","Robin","You wrap yourself in a comforter stuffed with rabbit hair. (almost yells) I wrap myself in one stuffed with duck feathers. Who's cosier? No, no, no, no, no, no... who's cosier?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22584","Ted","Hold on, I've got to get another book.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22585","Ted","Then why don't we take, a rabbit, a duck, stick 'em in a cardboard box and let them fight it out?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22586","Marshall","Because it's illegal, Ted!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22587","Ted","Only if we bet on it, Marshall!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22588","Marshall","FINE! I CAN SEE IT! YOU WIN!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22589","Robin","Say it.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"

"22640","Robin","Before you go meet your future wife, why don't you swing by Don's party with me?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22641","Ted","That's what you're wearing?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22642","Robin","Yeah, why?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22643","Ted","He's a duck. That dude be straight-ducking. ""And I think that I'll amaze her"". Nailed it!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"

"22645","Robin","They're not gonna get...","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"

"22650","Robin","Come... god, Don, what the hell are you doing?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22651","Don","I don't know. It's something called the Naked Man. I read about it on some guy's blog. My god, I'm so stupid, why did I ever think it would work on someone like you?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22652","Robin","Yeah, cause I would never, could like, standards, so... you know... I thought this was a party.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22653","Don","I only said that to get you to come over here. I didn't think you'd bring a date.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22654","Robin","Ted's not my date. He's a friend.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22655","Don","Oh god, you probably think I'm some kind of playboy now, right?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22656","Robin","(sees Don with imaginary rabbit's ears) You could say that.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22657","Ted","So he's a rabbit. At least you know for sure.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22658","Robin","Ted, this may hurt a little, I'm recycling your old Architecture Weekly magazines.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22659","Ted","What are you doing?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"

"22670","Marshall","Natalie?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22671","Lily","Ted's her least favorite person in the world.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22672","Marshall","Well, she's not getting any younger.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22673","Barney","Get rid of it. This phone is cursed. Cursed, I tell you! I tried to ignore it but it just never stops ringing. It's ruining my life! I should get that. (Marshall takes it away from him) No, please, please, please, Marshall, let me answer it, it could be an emergency, she could be trapped in a giant bra.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22674","Ranjit","Barney, Barney, let it go... to voicemail. (carries him to the cab)","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22675","Barney","(mumbles) OK... (cries into Ranjit's shoulder)","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22676","Marshall","We have to find Ted a wife. We're being too choosey. It almost doesn't matter who it is at this point. (both look over at Barney's phone)","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22677","Ted","It's a phone girl!?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22678","Marshall","I know, I know... but no, then we met her and Ted... she's a world-class violinist, she's a gourmet cook and she can quote every line from Caddy Shack.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22679","Ted","Wow.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22680","Hot Chick","Hello, Ted! ""And what brings you to this nape of the woods, neck of the wape? Why are you here?"" (Ted's impressed)","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22681","Marshall","Oh but Natalia, tell Ted the problem.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22682","Lily","Yeah, yeah, tell him, tell him!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22683","Natalia","Well, unfortunately I'm going to have to leave the country soon because my visa is about to expire.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22684","Lily","(whispers) She needs to get married.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22685","Marshall","(whispers too) Federal law expressly dictates that a foreign national can't maintain residency for longer than six months without a work visa.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22686","Waiter","And you, Sir? The rabbit or the duck?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22687","Ted","What?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22688","Waiter","It's a pre-fixed menu for Valentine's Day and we're already out of the steak, fish and chicken. So rabbit or duck?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22689","Ted","Rabbit. Sorry, guys, I gotta go. (he leaves)","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22690","Marshall","Why would Ted order the rabbit if he's just gonna run out?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22691","Barney","I need it back. Where is the phone? Well, heeellooooo. Oh I met you already. Where is the phone?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22692","Lily","It's hidden.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22693","Barney","Where?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22694","Robin","You go on your date. Happy Valentine's Day.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22695","Ted","Barney's phone... I wonder how it got in there?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22696","Robin","Ted! Come on. Big date.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22697","Ted","Uh what's the harm... Hello!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22698","Ted","Terrific. I will see you there. And I'll be the guy in the awesome blazer. Ah ah ah I think you'll know the blazer when you see it. Oooh! I gotta go.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22699","Marshall","Oh, thank god, you're here.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22700","Waiter","So rabbit or duck?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22701","Ted","Rabbit. Sorry, guys, I gotta go.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22702","Ted","Well, heeellooooo. (to a pretty girl ; phone rings) Sorry, babe, I gotta take this. Barney's phone, Teddy Westside speaking.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22703","Barney","My phone. I'm taking it back. And I'm taking your cool nickname too. Barney Westside speaking.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22704","Ted","No, no, I love it so much. It just keeps ringing and ringing and ringing. Give it, give it.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22705","Barney","(picks up) Hey, baby...","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22706","Ted","It's mine now.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22707","Barney","It's not your phone. (they fight over it)","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22708","Marshall","Lily. (hands her the phone). No. No! (Barney grabs his neck) Aaaargh.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22709","Lily","(drops the phone into a pitcher) Oops.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22710","Ted","Being single sucks. It turns you into a crazy person.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22711","Robin","I know. So much running around and freaking out. For what?","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22712","Ted","So long as you can find someone you can sit on the couch and put off cleaning the bathroom with.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22713","Robin","Well, the joke's on the rest of the world cause we can do that on our own.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22714","Ted","Exactly.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22715","Robin","Exactly.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22716","Don","Robin, I have to apologize...","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22717","Robin","Save it. Let's just do the news.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22718","Don","No. Listen... after you left the other night, I was embarrassed. Not because I was naked. I'm actually pretty OK with my body.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22719","Robin","Clearly.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22720","Don","I got married in college. I just got divorced three months ago. I have no idea how to be single. But that's not why I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed by my behavior right here at Channel...hmm, it starts with a 1, I know that, but...","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22721","Robin","12.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22722","Don","12!...","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22723","Robin","You can... just look at your mug.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22724","Don","Right. Well, no, you look at this mug (point to his face). You are a tremendous news anchor. And you deserve a co-anchor who gives a crap. And from here on out, it's gonna be me.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22725","Robin","Well, I'll believe that when I see it.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22726","Don","Well, you'll see it right now. I'll go get you some coffee.","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22727","Robin","Don!! You're wearing pants!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22728","Don","Well, look at that!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22729","Robin","(sees him with an imaginary duck's beak) Uh, duck!","05","15","Rabbit or Duck"
"22730","Ted (2030)","The children in my stories, I'm a romantic idealist in search of true love. In it, I'm just stupid.","05","16","Hooked"
"22731","Ted","Friends, tonight is the night. I invite Tiffany home to see my collection of vintage cameras.","05","16","Hooked"
"22732","Barney","It's the lure of Ted.","05","16","Hooked"
"22733","Lily","Bait?","05","16","Hooked"
"22734","Barney","A true gentleman invents an excuse to bring home a respectable lady. Something interesting or beautiful that can claim to admire for 5 minutes before it starts on the track.","05","16","Hooked"
"22735","Ted","As if she had to ""borrow a book"" or ""listen to old vinyl.""","05","16","Hooked"
"22736","Marshall","Or see your new poster rap.","05","16","Hooked"
"22737","Robin","Post rap? On which it would work?","05","16","Hooked"
"22738","Lily","It was the first week of college. I was way into Wu-Tang Clan.","05","16","Hooked"
"22739","Barney","It's tricky. It must be interesting enough that the girl up, but not too much not to spoil the evening.","05","16","Hooked"
"22740","Barney","The slot machine is too much fun. And a trampoline... that's actually too dangerous. But I finally found the perfect bait... A mini pig.","05","16","Hooked"
"22741","Ted","A mini pig? On which it would work?","05","16","Hooked"
"22742","Lily","You got a mini pig?","05","16","Hooked"
"22743","Robin","You can see the mini pig?","05","16","Hooked"
"22744","Ted","I can borrow your mini pig?","05","16","Hooked"
"22745","Barney","Yes, you can borrow.","05","16","Hooked"
"22746","Tiffany","You have a mini pig? I can not believe it! You're too cute!You're the cutest little pig on Earth! What?","05","16","Hooked"
"22747","Ted","You've always been so beautiful? You're going out on ""In high school I was super shy and I in my skin""?","05","16","Hooked"
"22748","Tiffany","I was shy and ill at ease. I'd like 50 more pounds and protruding teeth.","05","16","Hooked"
"22749","Ted","Seriously?","05","16","Hooked"
"22750","Tiffany","No. I was always canon. What can I do? You know who else would love this mini pig? (He goes to kiss) My boyfriend.","05","16","Hooked"
"22751","Ted","You got a boyfriend?","05","16","Hooked"
"22752","Tiffany","I know... Boring, eh? Finally, it is... not really my boyfriend.","05","16","Hooked"
"22753","Ted","Okay.","05","16","Hooked"
"22754","Tiffany","Well, technically it is.","05","16","Hooked"
"22755","Ted","He is or not?","05","16","Hooked"
"22756","Tiffany","A little each but not both.","05","16","Hooked"
"22757","Ted","Do you understand anything?","05","16","Hooked"
"22758","Tiffany","I appreciate you. But you must be patient. I do not want to lose you, my Dark Brown.","05","16","Hooked"
"22759","Ted","Someone does not want to lose his Dark Brown.","05","16","Hooked"
"22760","Robin","She gave you her hook.","05","16","Hooked"
"22761","Ted","What? I am not to his hook.","05","16","Hooked"
"22762","Barney","Yes, completely.","05","16","Hooked"
"22763","Robin","It gives you false hope, but it does not engage with you, but it keeps you in the corner, just in case, like... an old canned chili in the pantry.","05","16","Hooked"
"22764","Lily","Who would buy a can of chili for not eating it away?","05","16","Hooked"
"22765","Marshall","Amen, sister.","05","16","Hooked"
"22766","Robin","Do you feel pretty good. It is gone. It was on both sides. I was hooked and crocheter. It's good guys. I was shameless, but I did not have money problems.","05","16","Hooked"
"22767","Marshall","I've been hooked. Lisa Walker. See the scene... In 1994, St. Cloud, Minnesota.","05","16","Hooked"
"22768","Marshall","So I was, like, thinking, Lisa, do, perhaps you want, like, go out with me?","05","16","Hooked"
"22769","Lisa","It sounds great. But I'm seeing this guy. It has a LeBaron convertible and an unlimited pass to the rink, so I would not miss it.","05","16","Hooked"
"22770","Marshall","I understand.","05","16","Hooked"
"22771","Lisa","What if we did that? You could be my secret boyfriend who does all my homework.","05","16","Hooked"
"22772","Marshall","Okay. Wanna see my post of rap?","05","16","Hooked"
"22773","Lily","Whore posting!","05","16","Hooked"
"22774","Marshall","So... Lisa Walker gave me false hope for months until one night I went to tell him how much I loved her. In song.","05","16","Hooked"
"22775","Marshall","She was not home yet so I waited. And expected. I woke up, covered with snow, after 4h. And then I saw them. The footprints of Lisa. She had passed right by me to the house.","05","16","Hooked"
"22776","Marshall","It was fine in the end. It freed me from its hook.","05","16","Hooked"
"22777","Ted","That's not the same with me and Tiffany. Listen.","05","16","Hooked"
"22778","Tiffany","You interest me very much. But I can not be with you for now.","05","16","Hooked"
"22779","Robin","""Right now"" is the catch phrase of choice.","05","16","Hooked"
"22780","Marshall","""For now"" you draw a picture of a future where everything will be magical, but in truth, it'll never happen.","05","16","Hooked"
"22781","Barney","It's like that. ""I can not be with you"". ""For now.""","05","16","Hooked"
"22782","Lily","I think my high school boyfriend Scooter, is a little to my hook.","05","16","Hooked"
"22783","Marshall","A little? Completely. The poor showed up at our wedding hope you recover.","05","16","Hooked"
"22784","Lily","It's weird when I see him at work.","05","16","Hooked"
"22785","Marshall","Wait. What?","05","16","Hooked"
"22786","Lily","Scooter works in the Ikea cafeteria 'school. We talked.","05","16","Hooked"
"22787","Scooter","Nice dress. French fries? I love you.","05","16","Hooked"
"22788","Marshall","We certainly do not talk about that!","05","16","Hooked"
"22789","Lily","But if. I talked to full time. ""Scooter canteen.""","05","16","Hooked"
"22790","Marshall","I thought you was talking about a long-awaited means of transport, carrying such poor canteen.","05","16","Hooked"
"22791","Lily","It explains a lot.","05","16","Hooked"
"22792","Lily","Scooter canteen was still there today.","05","16","Hooked"
"22793","Marshall","You're mounted on it? You did a tour?","05","16","Hooked"
"22794","Lily","No!","05","16","Hooked"
"22795","Marshall","Really? In your place I would have rode this scooter all day to break it into two.","05","16","Hooked"
"22796","Marshall","So these poor women must still walk? Expect. Scooter works in your school?","05","16","Hooked"
"22797","Lily","Are you jealous?","05","16","Hooked"
"22798","Marshall","I feel bad for Scooter. It took this job just because he thinks he has a chance with you. You must ensure that he understands that it is wrong for it turns the page and gets a real work canteen. sh1t!","05","16","Hooked"
"22799","Lily","I tried!","05","16","Hooked"
"22800","Scooter","I saw that you had free time. So do I. And if you fled?","05","16","Hooked"
"22801","Lily","Let me be clear, Scooter. There is no way that you and I are together. For now.","05","16","Hooked"
"22802","Scooter","See you tomorrow. It's Tuesday Tijuana.","05","16","Hooked"
"22803","Marshall","""For now""? You got to the earnest Scooter? You must release your scooter hook.","05","16","Hooked"
"22804","Lily","You're right. Tomorrow, that's what I'll do.","05","16","Hooked"
"22805","Marshall","Why not tomorrow?","05","16","Hooked"
"22806","Lily","I can not spoil the Tijuana Tuesday.","05","16","Hooked"
"22807","Barney","Really? You really gonna sit and watch the door all night because Tiffany said she would try to pass?","05","16","Hooked"
"22808","Ted","I will not give up.","05","16","Hooked"
"22809","Ted (2030)","I should have quit.","05","16","Hooked"
"22810","Ted","This girl is special.","05","16","Hooked"
"22811","Ted (2030)","It was the devil!","05","16","Hooked"
"22812","Ted","It will get better with Tiffany.","05","16","Hooked"
"22813","Ted (2030)","No, moron!","05","16","Hooked"
"22814","Barney","Ted, let me be clear. That girl is poison and you have to forget your life forever.","05","16","Hooked"
"22815","Ted","There she is. (Between Tiffany followed by several other women) It has led to colleagues.","05","16","Hooked"
"22816","Barney","Hold on to it. Never lets go! I have never seen more beautiful girls. They all work with Tiffany?","05","16","Hooked"
"22817","Ted","Yep.","05","16","Hooked"
"22818","Barney","There can be only one explanation for that. Tiffany is a representative... e, pharmaceuticals?","05","16","Hooked"
"22819","Ted","How do you know?","05","16","Hooked"
"22820","Barney","And you never thought to say?","05","16","Hooked"
"22821","Ted","What? It's just a job.","05","16","Hooked"
"22822","Barney","That a b... Since time immemorial there has always been a professional edge to which girls guns, like Tiffany, have flocked. I'll redo the story?","05","16","Hooked"
"22823","Ted","I will not say explicitly.","05","16","Hooked"
"22824","Barney","It began 2.5 million years ago. The man was a hunter.So the profession's sexiest moment? Picker. Homo erectus, indeed. With improved technology, the profession's sexiest moment was changing. I'm sure it's a hernia. You can double-check? And then the man grabbed the heavens. So girls sexy stiletto heels began and became a flight attendant. I'm right and ready to fire. Then the man said, ""Life is hard. I should start taking lots of drugs. "" So sexy girls landed in medical offices, hot enough to make these pills erection ironically unnecessary. So today, girls are pharma's sexiest moment.","05","16","Hooked"
"22825","Tiffany","Hi my great darkness. How are you?","05","16","Hooked"
"22826","Ted","Okay. In fact, you've dumped your loser of guy?","05","16","Hooked"
"22827","Tiffany","No, sir.","05","16","Hooked"
"22828","Ted","She touched my nose.","05","16","Hooked"
"22829","Barney","Largue Tiffany and join the Barnacle in a buffet of girls pharma. There may be loss of clothing, knees burned, respiratory weakness and sore abs the next day. That the world give a damn five?!","05","16","Hooked"
"22830","Marshall","I know you're having trouble dropping Scooter. I decided that you need training. And you say that the problem is his sad eyes? (He returns with a mini pig) Okay, shut up, woman. Now I want you to look this mini pig and you tell him it is impossible for you to be with him one day.","05","16","Hooked"
"22831","Lily","Mini Pig, it is impossible that I may one day with you. For now.","05","16","Hooked"
"22832","Marshall","Go! Be a man!","05","16","Hooked"
"22833","Lily","I'm sorry, but it is just so cute. I just want to cuddle him all day. Oh, yes.","05","16","Hooked"
"22834","Marshall","You know, it's funny. I remember when you told me stuff like that.","05","16","Hooked"
"22835","Lily","I still do.","05","16","Hooked"
"22836","Marshall","Not as much. Not as much.","05","16","Hooked"
"22837","Barney","There's no nights like with pharma pharma because the nights never stop! Dude, I've flirted with three of them. The fantasy. In addition, my cholesterol is low. My restless legs syndrome is cured. I am more alive than ever.","05","16","Hooked"
"22838","Ted","Friends, good news. Tiffany broke up with her boyfriend. So I'm not the hook.","05","16","Hooked"
"22839","Robin","You're always on the hook.","05","16","Hooked"
"22840","Ted","Look what we did yesterday.","05","16","Hooked"
"22841","Ted","First, it was spoiled. Then we shared a chocolate cake.Then, well, I did not used to join the discussions of changing rooms, but I made her a foot massage... rather sensual.","05","16","Hooked"
"22842","Robin","And let me guess  it's not gone further than that.","05","16","Hooked"
"22843","Ted","Well, no, but...","05","16","Hooked"
"22844","Lily","And tell me, would you have accidentally made this chocolate cake?","05","16","Hooked"
"22845","Ted","It was a pre-made.","05","16","Hooked"
"22846","Lily","There's no shame to admit it. We were all hooked and we all hooked someone.","05","16","Hooked"
"22847","Ted","I've never done that.","05","16","Hooked"
"22848","Robin","Are you kidding? And this daughter of the university library? Henrietta?","05","16","Hooked"
"22849","Ted","Henrietta and I are just friends.","05","16","Hooked"
"22850","Robin","It is too much to your hook.","05","16","Hooked"
"22851","Ted","Absolutely not.","05","16","Hooked"
"22852","Ted (2030)","Yes, completely. Finally...","05","16","Hooked"
"22853","Ted (2030)","... it was spoiled. We shared a chocolate cake. It made me long foot massages. I'm not proud of, children.","05","16","Hooked"
"22854","Robin","You like to have Henrietta close for the same reason that Tiffany likes to have you close, it flatters the ego.","05","16","Hooked"
"22855","Ted","You amaze me that such an expert is to keep people on your hook. And this poor cameraman your job?","05","16","Hooked"
"22856","Robin","Mike and I are just friends.","05","16","Hooked"
"22857","Ted","Come on.","05","16","Hooked"
"22858","Robin","Yeah, right.","05","16","Hooked"
"22859","Mike","You never thought to go to the next step with me?","05","16","Hooked"
"22860","Robin","If you mean to do my laundry, I'm starting lineup.","05","16","Hooked"
"22861","Mike","It's a deal.","05","16","Hooked"
"22862","Robin","What! I do not keep Mike in my hook.","05","16","Hooked"
"22863","Ted","You're Captain Hook.","05","16","Hooked"
"22864","Robin","Dude, I'm a girl. Our female parts are like a cobweb.Sometimes you jokes of things you want to.","05","16","Hooked"
"22865","Ted","That's not why it's good.","05","16","Hooked"
"22866","Robin","And Henrietta, in any way, are not losing time with you, huh?","05","16","Hooked"
"22867","Ted","Henrietta knows we're just friends. In fact, I'll call and get away with it tonight, friends.","05","16","Hooked"
"22868","Henrietta","I love you. What? Want a foot massage? Because I'm driven on me.","05","16","Hooked"
"22869","Ted","No, that's fine.","05","16","Hooked"
"22870","Henrietta","I did not know if you were hungry, I did some stuff... Nothing special.","05","16","Hooked"
"22871","Ted (2030)","Children, looking back, I do not know how I have not seen Henrietta was crazy about me.","05","16","Hooked"
"22872","Ted","Hello?","05","16","Hooked"
"22873","Tiffany","Hey Ted!","05","16","Hooked"
"22874","Ted","Hey Tiffany!","05","16","Hooked"
"22875","Tiffany","I go to the country this weekend at a friends wedding.Wanna be my cavalier?","05","16","Hooked"
"22876","Ted","I would love that. What are you doing here? Great. See you in 10 minutes. Super. Sorry, Henrietta, something unexpected.We redo it, my friend?","05","16","Hooked"
"22877","Henrietta","Yeah, it's not a concern.","05","16","Hooked"
"22878","Ted","It works, yeah.","05","16","Hooked"
"22879","Henrietta","You have the strength.","05","16","Hooked"
"22880","Ted (2030)","What a jerk.","05","16","Hooked"
"22881","Mother of Henrietta","Wait. Where is Ted? I thought we would finally meet him.","05","16","Hooked"
"22882","Henrietta","An unexpected, okay, Mom?","05","16","Hooked"
"22883","Father","I told you there was not.","05","16","Hooked"
"22884","Henrietta","I heard.","05","16","Hooked"
"22885","Ted (2030)","So there I was, at one of the surest signs to make a landing in a relationship  a country wedding. It finally came.","05","16","Hooked"
"22886","Ted","Champagne?","05","16","Hooked"
"22887","Tiffany","I forgot to call you.","05","16","Hooked"
"22888","Ted","Whatever it is, we can talk now.","05","16","Hooked"
"22889","Tiffany","This is Jack. This is the man at the wedding. We just get back together.","05","16","Hooked"
"22890","Ted","Now that I think a call would have been nice.","05","16","Hooked"
"22891","Jack","Is that you Ted? But I heard you were doing a great chocolate cake.","05","16","Hooked"
"22892","Tiffany","It is not great? And it is in a group. Thank you.","05","16","Hooked"
"22893","Marshall","Come on, Lily. You must drop Scooter. Try it again.","05","16","Hooked"
"22894","Lily","Mini pig... I do not wanna be with you. For now.","05","16","Hooked"
"22895","Marshall","Act like a man!","05","16","Hooked"
"22896","Lily","Mini pig... I do not wanna be with you. Ever.","05","16","Hooked"
"22897","Marshall","Finish him!","05","16","Hooked"
"22898","Lily","It will never be together in any sexual way again.","05","16","Hooked"
"22899","Marshall","Well done. Weird thing to say to a pig.","05","16","Hooked"
"22900","Lily","Really bad.","05","16","Hooked"
"22901","Tiffany","Well, I do not think it will work out between us. For now.","05","16","Hooked"
"22902","Ted (2030)","And that's when it hit me. I was at his hook. I also realized...","05","16","Hooked"
"22903","Tiffany","You've missed so much, baby.","05","16","Hooked"
"22904","Ted (2030)","Tiffany was to hook this guy. It was a vicious circle.Henrietta was my hook. And years later I learned that this poor guy was on the hook of Henrietta.","05","16","Hooked"
"22905","Ted","You know what? That will not work between us... ever. I'm done. (He takes the jacket on the bed and hand) And that's really better for traffic if you weight the arch with your thumbs. Now I'm done.","05","16","Hooked"
"22906","Lily","I can do it alone.","05","16","Hooked"
"22907","Marshall","So prove it. And... take me a pudding.","05","16","Hooked"
"22908","Lily","Listen, Scooter. There is no way we ever be together.","05","16","Hooked"
"22909","Marshall","Right now! I'm sorry but he is adorable.","05","16","Hooked"
"22910","Lily","Listen. I want to be with you.","05","16","Hooked"
"22911","Marshall","So far. Hang in there. I will not be eternal.","05","16","Hooked"
"22912","Barney","Yesterday I was with this girl so sexy that pharma should call a doctor if you have no erection for more than 4h. I have no reason people?","05","16","Hooked"
"22913","Robin","There is no one. Just the girl with whom you came out recently.","05","16","Hooked"
"22914","Woman","I want you to meet the latest arrival.","05","16","Hooked"
"22915","Woman 2","Nice to meet you. I represent statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs.","05","16","Hooked"
"22916","Woman","Let's go have a drink.","05","16","Hooked"
"22917","Barney","It's over.","05","16","Hooked"
"22918","Robin","What?","05","16","Hooked"
"22919","Barney","The girls of pharma are more than gunnery. This is the end of an era.","05","16","Hooked"
"22920","Robin","You're a little dramatic.","05","16","Hooked"
"22921","Barney","Really? It starts with a Gladys. And suddenly, a few gay guys not so fabulous fall into the ranks. And before you know it, the girls look like pharma team to a Southwest flight to Albuquerque in Little Rock. It's over!","05","16","Hooked"
"22922","Ted (2030)","So that night I went to live in Henrietta prepared to release it from my hook.","05","16","Hooked"
"22923","Tiffany","This is Jack. This is the man at the wedding.","05","16","Hooked"
"22924","Ted","I'm done.","05","16","Hooked"
"22925","Henrietta","The answer is yes!","05","16","Hooked"
"22926","Ted","It's worse.","05","16","Hooked"
"22927","Henrietta","This is perfect! Mom, Dad! Ted asked me to marry him!","05","16","Hooked"
"22928","Mother","I knew this would happen!","05","16","Hooked"
"22929","Father","My son!","05","16","Hooked"
"22930","Ted","Yeah, there was a...","05","16","Hooked"
"22931","Robin","What did you do?","05","16","Hooked"
"22932","Ted","Honestly, I thought to marry him just out of sheer embarrassment. But I did the right thing. I did what anyone who has someone should hook her. I would have broken my heart.","05","16","Hooked"
"22933","Ted","Henrietta, I'm sorry if it's brutal but I think you duty. I do not wanna be with you.","05","16","Hooked"
"22934","Henrietta","Right now?","05","16","Hooked"
"22935","Ted","Ever.","05","16","Hooked"
"22936","Henrietta","But we're still going to marry, does not it?","05","16","Hooked"
"22937","Ted","It was violent.","05","16","Hooked"
"22938","Robin","Sorry, big guy. Honesty is hard, but ultimately it is the softer alternative. (Mike enters with the laundry basket) I must tell you something. You've finished the laundry fragile?","05","16","Hooked"
"22939","Mike","Another tour.","05","16","Hooked"
"22940","Robin","It can wait.","05","16","Hooked"
"22941","Robin","How are you?","05","16","Hooked"
"22942","Ted","You still broies black to the end of the era of the daughters of pharma?","05","16","Hooked"
"22943","Barney","I've realized that their reign had to stop to give way to a sexy new profession. It may be... communications officer in an intergalactic spaceship to a distant solar system that we can imagine. Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits.","05","16","Hooked"
"22944","Robin","Why change your mind?","05","16","Hooked"
"22945","Barney","The realization that hope springs eternal. Ca and the little purple pill box found in my bag. I do not know what they are, but they are amazing!","05","16","Hooked"
"22946","Ted (2030)","Children, during a warm evening in March 2010, the New York police rescued a 34 year old man from the Hudson River... your Uncle Barney.","05","17","Of Course"
"22947","Police","Okay, big guy, tell me all along.","05","17","Of Course"
"22948","Barney","It all started a week ago.","05","17","Of Course"
"22949","Barney","I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady.","05","17","Of Course"
"22950","Woman","Nothing is sexier than a man wearing a nice tie.","05","17","Of Course"
"22951","Barney","Aside from a woman who appreciates a nice tie.","05","17","Of Course"
"22952","Woman","But this is merely a tie.","05","17","Of Course"
"22953","Barney","It was not my best tie.","05","17","Of Course"
"22954","Police","Right.","05","17","Of Course"
"22955","Barney","So, right after that, I took her home.","05","17","Of Course"
"22956","Woman","When I'm in bed with a man, my body becomes a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger to satisfy every single... the carnal desires of my lover.","05","17","Of Course"
"22957","Barney","Fortunately, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow.","05","17","Of Course"
"22958","Woman","Good night.","05","17","Of Course"
"22959","Barney","What? Wait, what? I thought your body would become a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger only to satisfy my every carnal desires.","05","17","Of Course"
"22960","Robin","I really think Don and I found our rhythm to work.","05","17","Of Course"
"22961","Don","Thanks to this young woman to my left. This report on how rodent avoided in the subway...","05","17","Of Course"
"22962","Robin","The answer might surprise you. It's all rodents.","05","17","Of Course"
"22963","Don","I gotta go, okay? See you soon.","05","17","Of Course"
"22964","Marshall","Nice to meet you.","05","17","Of Course"
"22965","Don","I do too.","05","17","Of Course"
"22966","Marshall","This guy is awesome. It's funny, smart, beautiful. You have him to nab it before someone else.","05","17","Of Course"
"22967","Robin","I hope you do not talk to you.","05","17","Of Course"
"22968","Lily","It's been 4 months since you broke up with Barney. It's time to get back on the market.","05","17","Of Course"
"22969","Marshall","Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier.","05","17","Of Course"
"22970","Barney","I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners.","05","17","Of Course"
"22971","Ted","It looks like she has read this book, Of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail. What? It was this book that helps girls find a husband. It is that of Robin. I just laminated. Okay! Barney, when you were with this girl, she subtly used the word ""s*x""?","05","17","Of Course"
"22972","Woman","I'm in the inter-gender-ing, and I have some sex-seconds before the light turns green. And then, everyone honks, and it really s*x, but I can not run because a jogger slips and falls in the Sacraments of sex-horse.","05","17","Of Course"
"22973","Barney","Continuous. Continues.","05","17","Of Course"
"22974","Ted","Did she used an excuse for physical contact?","05","17","Of Course"
"22975","Woman","It's the cashmere?","05","17","Of Course"
"22976","Barney","Kashmir? This is the virgin merino hand-woven. The fibers of this costume are spaced less than 12 microns.","05","17","Of Course"
"22977","Female","12 microns. I like the tight fibers.","05","17","Of Course"
"22978","Barney","Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle.","05","17","Of Course"
"22979","Barney","She did it too!","05","17","Of Course"
"22980","Ted","And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, ""I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week? ""","05","17","Of Course"
"22981","Barney","You try this sh1t of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail.","05","17","Of Course"
"22982","Woman","It's not crap. Sure you're alone, look at you, poor trail, is a brilliant book. And it scares the guys who only want the ass.","05","17","Of Course"
"22983","Barney","Did you just say you got a kid!","05","17","Of Course"
"22984","Woman","You'd be surprised how many assholes we cross. That is why my book says to never sleep at first date.","05","17","Of Course"
"22985","Barney","Completely.","05","17","Of Course"
"22986","Woman","Or the second. Or the third.","05","17","Of Course"
"22987","Barney","Of course. Well...","05","17","Of Course"
"22988","Woman","Or the fourth.","05","17","Of Course"
"22989","Barney","Just tell me how!","05","17","Of Course"
"22990","Female","17.","05","17","Of Course"
"22991","Barney","Excuse me, someone is using this stool?","05","17","Of Course"
"22992","Ted","That is  no s*x before hot date 17th.","05","17","Of Course"
"22993","Lily","If you're not going to take her 17th hot date, you should give up.","05","17","Of Course"
"22994","Barney","I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted...","05","17","Of Course"
"22995","Ted","From Robin is Robin.","05","17","Of Course"
"22996","Barney","I can have two shots ahead. There is a flaw in there and I will get it.","05","17","Of Course"
"22997","Don","Listen... You wanna go out on Saturday night?","05","17","Of Course"
"22998","Robin","Saturday night?","05","17","Of Course"
"22999","Marshall","It invites you to come out? Say yes! Say yes!","05","17","Of Course"
"23000","Robin","Don... Listen, it's... it's really nice of you, and you're really great...","05","17","Of Course"
"23001","Marshall, with the phone in the kitchen","Yes, I'm going out with you.","05","17","Of Course"
"23002","Don","Robin, you okay?","05","17","Of Course"
"23003","Marshall","I just have a cold. That's why for my voice. (She goes into the kitchen and tries to pick up the phone) But great for Saturday night. One can go to a restaurant grill, and you could bring a first side for my friends Marshall. I gotta go. Kisses.","05","17","Of Course"
"23004","Robin","But what are you doing?","05","17","Of Course"
"23005","Marshall","You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you.","05","17","Of Course"
"23006","Barney","I can not believe. Friends... This is it! She wrote the book! It must be named Anita. My plan was to sleep with her but it changes everything. New plan  I'll sleep with her.","05","17","Of Course"
"23007","Lily","That girl that Barney hunting, it seems a somewhat anti-Barney. I like the way the universe has decided to collect.","05","17","Of Course"
"23008","Robin","Actually, Anita Barney went to see him because I have requested.","05","17","Of Course"
"23009","Lily","You told to go and see Anita Barney? How you know her?","05","17","Of Course"
"23010","Robin","It was my show.","05","17","Of Course"
"23011","Robin","But, uh... if you had to summarize your book in less than 30 words...","05","17","Of Course"
"23012","Anita","I would summarize in one, Robin. And that word is ""no.""By saying no constantly and consistently, it gives a power, simultaneously transforming any fool in human wreck, subject, and whining.","05","17","Of Course"
"23013","Robin","Is not this the dream of all women? After the break, we'll talk about your new book, Of course you have not yet retirement plan, look at you, poor trail, scheduled for June We come back after the break.","05","17","Of Course"
"23014","Mike","It's good. You want a coffee?","05","17","Of Course"
"23015","Robin","Absolutely, Mike, great idea.","05","17","Of Course"
"23016","Mike","You?","05","17","Of Course"
"23017","Anita","No. And you, Robin? You go out with someone?","05","17","Of Course"
"23018","Robin","I have not really want right now.","05","17","Of Course"
"23019","Anita","You were broken heart?","05","17","Of Course"
"23020","Robin","And then I told him everything. It came out at once. And in the end, she said...","05","17","Of Course"
"23021","Anita","That Barney needs a lesson. Give me the order, and I will destroy it.","05","17","Of Course"
"23022","Robin","That's to say?","05","17","Of Course"
"23023","Anita","I will use the power of ""no"" to destroy your friend Barney.Say it.","05","17","Of Course"
"23024","Robin","Come on, it does not really work, though?","05","17","Of Course"
"23025","Mike","I knew not what you wanted when I caught you a cappuccino, espresso, latte, decaf... and a Turkish coffee.","05","17","Of Course"
"23026","Anita","Thank you, Mike. Think about it.","05","17","Of Course"
"23027","Robin","I never thought that I would think, but... I thought about it.","05","17","Of Course"
"23028","Barney","This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger. (Robin phone) I put on the StairMaster and...","05","17","Of Course"

"23031","Anita","It's done. (Mike brings a drink to Anita) Thank you, Mike.","05","17","Of Course"
"23032","Robin","I know it was stupid, but, see, at that time, I was still depressed over the break. I was in my phase of mourning. It means a lot of tape and long nights at the shooting range.","05","17","Of Course"
"23033","Lily","I hope this was not the same nights.","05","17","Of Course"
"23034","Robin","Serious, Lily. I do not remember everything.","05","17","Of Course"
"23035","Marshall","You knew that Robin was in mourning? It looked good after the break.","05","17","Of Course"
"23036","Lily","You know her. She keeps her emotions for her. But yes, I saw her crying sometimes.","05","17","Of Course"

"23039","Marshall","Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier. You see, this guy has been very active. Sexually. Finally, it is like that... bang... bang... bang... You see? It's like... bang... bang...","05","17","Of Course"
"23040","Marshall","How could you let me do? You're my wife. You must avoid that I ridiculed in public.","05","17","Of Course"
"23041","Lily","I know, but the song is rather catchy.","05","17","Of Course"

"23043","Ted","There is another option... but you're not ready.","05","17","Of Course"
"23044","Barney","Tell me.","05","17","Of Course"
"23045","Ted","If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date.","05","17","Of Course"
"23046","Barney","A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?","05","17","Of Course"
"23047","Ted","If you want my help, it's a super hot date.","05","17","Of Course"
"23048","Barney","Okay.","05","17","Of Course"
"23049","Ted","Let me do it. I will plan everything.","05","17","Of Course"
"23050","Barney","You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic?","05","17","Of Course"
"23051","Ted","Cutesy and romantic? (He starts singing) No need to take him to Paris or Peru...","05","17","Of Course"
"23052","Barney","What are you doing?","05","17","Of Course"
"23053","Ted singing","You just gotta make him understand...","05","17","Of Course"
"23054","Barney","They look at us.","05","17","Of Course"
"23055","Ted","How important it is for you...","05","17","Of Course"
"23056","Barney","Really? You really gonna do that?","05","17","Of Course"
"23057","Ted, still singing","In your super hot date, Global problems will simply be put aside, for wonders and surprises that will be the stars. Hurry, do not be late because together, you will find a country where paradise is rebukes. And then, boom! Fireworks in the sky over Manhattan! You kiss him. And your super hot date.","05","17","Of Course"
"23058","Barney","It looks to me like cutesy and romantic. Box strip?","05","17","Of Course"
"23059","Ted","Box strip.","05","17","Of Course"
"23060","Ted (2030)","Finally, the night of the great rencards arrived.","05","17","Of Course"
"23061","Marshall","Tonight is the big night. Where do you take D-Bag?This is a bad nickname for Don. I will look better.","05","17","Of Course"
"23062","Robin","I just... I canceled.","05","17","Of Course"
"23063","Marshall","How does it... Wait.","05","17","Of Course"
"23064","Lily","A problem?","05","17","Of Course"
"23065","Marshall","Robin canceled his hot date.","05","17","Of Course"
"23066","Ted","What? She was super excited there is one hour.","05","17","Of Course"
"23067","Ted","You look like the classiest and most expensive of all prostitutes.","05","17","Of Course"
"23068","Robin","Thank you.","05","17","Of Course"
"23069","Ted","You're excited to go out with Don?","05","17","Of Course"
"23070","Robin","You know what? Looks good. Do not tell Marshall.","05","17","Of Course"
"23071","Ted","I will say nothing. I bet you will spend a good evening. And not, however, a great night. A great night will be spent by Barney during his date with Anita. A carriage ride, dinner at ""Tombeur panties."" They call it a super hot date.","05","17","Of Course"
"23072","Marshall","Ted! How could you do that?! Robin has just released his period of mourning!","05","17","Of Course"
"23073","Ted","She seemed happy after the break.","05","17","Of Course"
"23074","Marshall","You see nothing. Typical of a guy. She was obviously devastated.","05","17","Of Course"
"23075","Ted","Wait, but that would mean...","05","17","Of Course"
"23076","Ted (2030)","And I understood what I had been con with Robin.","05","17","Of Course"
"23077","Ted","You sing what?","05","17","Of Course"
"23078","Marshall","A song about the number of girls that Barney has typed recently.","05","17","Of Course"
"23079","Ted","I'll sing a verse.","05","17","Of Course"
"23080","Marshall","Super.","05","17","Of Course"
"23081","Ted","Where is she?","05","17","Of Course"
"23082","Marshall","I think it is the toilet.","05","17","Of Course"
"23083","Robin","I'm fine, I'm fine.","05","17","Of Course"
"23084","Barney","Why did you do that?","05","17","Of Course"
"23085","Marshall","Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire.","05","17","Of Course"
"23086","Barney","Why are you angry against me?","05","17","Of Course"
"23087","Ted","You were a real asshole to Robin when she was in her period of mourning.","05","17","Of Course"
"23088","Barney","The period of mourning? She has not had a period of mourning.","05","17","Of Course"
"23089","Ted","You see nothing.","05","17","Of Course"
"23090","Marshall","Typical of a guy.","05","17","Of Course"
"23091","Lily","Barney, sit down, there are two three things to tell you.","05","17","Of Course"
"23092","Barney","What, she is upset?","05","17","Of Course"
"23093","Lily","Of course she is upset. Look at you, poor trail.","05","17","Of Course"
"23094","Ted (2030)","Then Aunt Lily told Barney all the little details of what he had not seen since the break.","05","17","Of Course"
"23095","Barney","You should have seen.","05","17","Of Course"
"23096","Robin","I'm going.","05","17","Of Course"
"23097","Barney","We go back home...","05","17","Of Course"
"23098","Barney","I can not believe that Robin is upset.","05","17","Of Course"
"23099","Marshall","And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet.","05","17","Of Course"
"23100","Barney","I did worse after the premiere of ""The Phantom Menace.""It's been like that since we broke up?","05","17","Of Course"
"23101","Lily","Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where.","05","17","Of Course"
"23102","Barney","I know where.","05","17","Of Course"
"23103","Robin","Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date.","05","17","Of Course"
"23104","Barney","I know you're upset.","05","17","Of Course"
"23105","Robin","What? No. I've never been happier. Anita and this seems great. I'm so glad... by the merest chance, you found yourself. It warms my f*cking heart.","05","17","Of Course"
"23106","Barney","You sure you're not upset?","05","17","Of Course"
"23107","Robin","Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you?","05","17","Of Course"
"23108","Barney","You're not another number for me.","05","17","Of Course"
"23109","Robin","And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks.","05","17","Of Course"
"23110","Barney","I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven?","05","17","Of Course"
"23111","Robin","Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you.","05","17","Of Course"
"23112","Barney","Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want.","05","17","Of Course"
"23113","Robin","Do not sleep with Anita.","05","17","Of Course"
"23114","Barney","I promise.","05","17","Of Course"
"23115","Robin","Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not?","05","17","Of Course"
"23116","Barney","It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go.","05","17","Of Course"
"23117","Ted (2030)","Your uncle Barney gave Robin finally the super hot date she deserved. With a guy she deserved. Of course, there was a detail to be resolved.","05","17","Of Course"
"23118","Barney","I wanted to call you.","05","17","Of Course"
"23119","Anita","I violate any rules in my coming here, but... no one asks me rabbit like that, so we go out or not?","05","17","Of Course"
"23120","Barney","I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no.","05","17","Of Course"
"23121","Anita","I see. You try the trick of ""no."" You really think it'll work?Because it will not work. Okay, I'll make a deal. Maybe... you might get lucky after the 12th hot date.","05","17","Of Course"
"23122","Barney","No.","05","17","Of Course"
"23123","Anita","The 11th?","05","17","Of Course"
"23124","Barney","No.","05","17","Of Course"
"23125","Anita","The fifth?","05","17","Of Course"
"23126","Barney","No.","05","17","Of Course"
"23127","Anita","Tonight?","05","17","Of Course"
"23128","Barney","No.","05","17","Of Course"
"23129","Anita","This evening before dinner?","05","17","Of Course"
"23130","Barney","No.","05","17","Of Course"
"23131","Anita, Ted","And you? You're interested.","05","17","Of Course"
"23132","Ted","Yeah.","05","17","Of Course"
"23133","Anita","Go.","05","17","Of Course"
"23134","Barney","I'm sorry. The answer is no.","05","17","Of Course"
"23135","Anita","Well. Because my answer is no, too. This is my last offer.","05","17","Of Course"
"23136","Barney","Here is my story.","05","17","Of Course"
"23137","Police","This is a $ 500 fine for having jumped into the river. I hope it was worth it.","05","17","Of Course"
"23138","Barney","I hope so too.","05","17","Of Course"
"23139","Ted","This is an old story of married women.","05","17","Of Course"
"23140","Marshall","How was this date?","05","17","Of Course"
"23141","Robin","Good enough. Pretty... pretty good.","05","17","Of Course"

"23149","Lily","It's still my birthday!","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23150","Ted (2030)","Because he loves to prepare on birthdays.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23151","Marshall","Feliz cumpleanos, baby. The theme of this breakfast in bed is... ""Spanish Interlude."" (A musician enters the room and opens the curtain Marshall) How have we landed on the lyric rolling hills of northern Spain? Baby, it will be huge tonight. We five, dinner well dressed, and Ted brings your cognac cheesecake Pumpkin at Edgar. I'll go shopping super secret birthday. And I took him because I do not like the way he looks at you.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23152","Lily","A new camera! Thank you, Marshall. I love it!","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23153","Marshall","Small bonus, I took pictures of me naked before packing. With a node.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23154","Lily","There was not a knot.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23155","Marshall","On the other device.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23156","Lily","Thank you. I will make great photos of our group with that.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23157","Ted (2030)","Children, have you seen the photo album of Lily... Bound in leather, acid-free paper, adorable handwritten captions. And most importantly, the group photo. Nice picture, eh? But what you do not see are the 10 seconds before this photo was taken.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23158","Lily","I want the perfect group shot. Marshall put yourself between Robin and Barney.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23159","Barney","Why?","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23160","Lily","You know... Light, color, balance, aperture...","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23161","Robin","You say stuff pictures. Expect. You do not want it to look like a couple, right?","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23162","Lily","Of course. You will not last! The photo is forever.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23163","Barney","How dare you?","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23164","Robin","It's so rude.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23165","Barney","It's true.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23166","Robin","Totally. It is a tightrope, but still.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23167","Ted (2030)","We hated group photos of Lily.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23168","Lily","Okay, I am perhaps a little bossy, but I want to remember it all. Like tonight. I imagine no better birthday being with my 4 best friends only. (A knock at the door) And Ted's here.","05","18","Say Cheese"

"23180","Amanda","Her favorite color is... leg.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23181","Marshall","I think Ted whispered the word ""yellow"". It is equally untrue. (Later...) This game is called... raising the cost of perfection.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23182","Lily","Pretty.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23183","Marshall","Thank you. You wrote all that you love our queen of the day. And Lilypad, you must guess who wrote what. ""From his friends to his students, Lily that everyone in his life...""","05","18","Say Cheese"

"23185","Marshall","""... feel loved. She makes the best cookies oatmeal raisin-, The Goonies knows by heart... ""","05","18","Say Cheese"

"23228","Barney","Yes, at this point, I have never an old head on the photos. Neither ever or always.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23229","Robin","It's gotta be a lousy picture of you.","05","18","Say Cheese"

"23240","Robin","No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips?","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23241","Barney","It's physically impossible for me to take a picture ugly. I know why. Ask God.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23242","Ted","Lily, sorry for Amanda. But I'll say. You make your spoiled rotten. You in all your statements because you think I messed up two three photos?","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23243","Lily","These girls have ruined so many things, or you forget Paris.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23244","Robin","This is what happened in Paris?","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23245","Lily","In the first year of college, I studied in Paris, and I had not seen Marshall since 2 months.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23246","Marshall","2 months. And I just started making love. I was not ready to stop for 2 months.","05","18","Say Cheese"

"23281","Lily","Yes, okay, Ted. This bitch has proved some nice, but except for bitches, not the rule of bitches.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23282","Robin","I'm starting to cry.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23283","Marshall","It puts an end to all this conversation about the bitches.Back to the birthday song! Barney, your part is this  ""She's cute She's cute.""","05","18","Say Cheese"

"23295","Lily","Let us raise our glasses. During the last 3 years, Marshall has worked so hard, and I am so proud of you.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23296","Raspberry","Meat is murder! (She throws her drink in hand and cook) Murder!","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23297","Ted","I confess. Raspberry was a mistake. But how would I know?","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23298","All","It was called Raspberry!","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23299","Ted","If this is so important, Amanda is not in the picture. It does not spoil your birthday. Give him a chance.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23300","Marshall","Look. We're all friends again! Now working on the harmonies. Merry, Merry Lily-versary! Merry, Merry Lily-versary!","05","18","Say Cheese"

"23306","Marshall","If Lily is serious. Get out of this stranger in my house!","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23307","Amanda","I'm sorry.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23308","Marshall","Out!","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23309","Ted","Amanda refuses to return. She thinks you hate it. Marshall, you have to go apologize.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23310","Marshall","You've ruined Lily's birthday and you want me to apologize? At worst, you should apologize.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23311","Ted","What are you talking?","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23312","Marshall","You bring her girls at our parties, and it lets them believe that things are serious. After the largues when you, you know to whom they turn? Me. I was the cleaning crew of your girlfriends for years.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23313","Marshall","I had just returned from a marathon to study the law library. Hi, Natalie, where is Ted?","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23314","Natalie","We broke... again! You sit with me a little while? Just sit down?","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23315","Marshall","You know what? I have not slept for 36 hours. Just a few minutes.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23316","Marshall","And at first I was totally sympathetic. But damn, Ted, over the years, you made me cynical.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23317","Marshall","I'll get us something to eat, and we'll talk about it until it is clear.","05","18","Say Cheese"

"23323","Barney","They would be if Marshall was not on it.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23324","Marshall","Cheap Shot. Low blow.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23325","Ted","You know what these pictures? A big lie. We ask. They are retouched. They are what you want but not the reality.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23326","Lily","This is not true!","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23327","Ted","Oh? Look at that one. Halloween, there is 2 years old. You had not played because you wanted to disguise yourself as a penguin.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23328","Marshall","It's not that she would not, but she said that penguins are zero. Penguins.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23329","Ted","And yet you're there, smiling as if nothing was wrong, completely wrong. Robin's birthday, there is 3 years old. Robin had a cold, and you made him remove his pajamas for the photo.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23330","Robin","And you got me pinched cheeks very hard for them to be pink.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23331","Lily","Yeah, but you were beautiful.","05","18","Say Cheese"

"23340","Ted","Wait, we take what poses? The two cops friends?","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23341","Marshall","No! Why not sitcom of the 80s with two roommates who never agree?","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23342","Man","Cool. Fine. One, two...","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23343","Lily","Hi, Marshall. Ready for the film?","05","18","Say Cheese"

"23353","Lily","We must bring back Amanda.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23354","Ted","Really?","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23355","Lily","You believed in me. It's my turn to believe in you. As far as I know, this is good.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23356","Ted","Thank you, Lil.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23357","Robin","I think Lori's age made him very wise.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23358","Barney","It is said that it was after 40 years we know each other really.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23359","Ted (2030)","So your aunt Lily called Amanda.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23360","Lily","Come on everybody, come here. Let's make a memory.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23361","Ted","Marshall, try this. Keep your eyes closed until the last second and when I say, open them.","05","18","Say Cheese"
"23362","Robin","It's a hole in your jacket?","05","18","Say Cheese"

"23476","Lily","I think naked in a tree, throwing his feces.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23477","Robin","I've seen. That's why I take the taxi.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23478","Ted","You know how they caught him, huh?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23479","Marshall","They tracked.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23480","Ted","They tracked!","05","19","Zoo or False"

"23482","Marshall","Okay. That's what happened.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23483","Barney","No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana...","05","19","Zoo or False"

"23489","Robin","Come on, Barney. I know that Marshall has not been mugged by a monkey.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23490","Marshall","This part is right. It is not unusual, right? Thailand, China, Costa Rica, people are attacked by monkeys all the time.They are gatherers. Because of their dynamic inter-social, have a predisposition to flight, gives them a genetic advantage.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23491","Lily","You've been mugged by a monkey!","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23492","Ted","It might be curious. You were wearing a yellow hat?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23493","Ted","What? Him in your program? And my model?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23494","Robin","No one wants to see a guy who comes to play with dolls.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23495","Ted","First, it was not what you think. Secondly, you got a guy playing with dolls.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23496","Robin","So, your dolls are favorites of Rhinebeck prices next month.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23497","Men","Only if they are holding up well. Last year, I found one of her frolicking with GI Joe. This is not funny. What were you thinking? And if you were pregnant?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23498","Ted","And you invited back for a second interview.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23499","Robin","Because the FBI wanted to be occupied while they searched his home. Come on, Marshall. I need history. It has everything. Crime, monkeys, no stupid model of the Empire State Building, which takes me all my living room and smelly glue everywhere. Go. Do this for me... As a friend?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23500","Lily","It would be nice to see you on TV.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23501","Marshall","Can you promise me to present it so that I am not ridiculous to myself assaulted by a monkey?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23502","Lily","You've been mugged by a monkey.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23503","Barney","I've just been mugged.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23504","Ted","What?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23505","Barney","That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now...","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23506","Barney","It was downright terrifying. I would just like to forget what happened and continue to live my life.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23507","Woman","My poor darling.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23508","Woman 2","Neil? Neil!","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23509","Barney","Well, my name is not Neil. This is Bar...","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23510","Woman","Why you call it Neil?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23511","Woman 2","Because it's his name. This is Neil Armstrong.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23512","Woman","The cyclist?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23513","Woman 2","You're not supposed to be on a space mission?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23514","Woman","You've just mugged?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23515","Barney","Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23516","Woman 2","Me.","05","19","Zoo or False"

"23519","Ted","Funny, you look like you just got two vodka and tonic in the face.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23520","Marshall","You're the lemon in your hair.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23521","Barney","The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts...","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23522","Robin, entering","Marshall, you never will believe. I spoke to my producer monkey aggressor and he loves!","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23523","Marshall","Really? Cool.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23524","Robin","Who knows someone who has been mugged by a monkey?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23525","Marshall","Nobody except the good people of Thailand, China, Costa Rica and many other countries where the crime committed by the monkeys is a common nuisance.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23526","Robin","The best is that it is possible that the story goes on national TV. Guys, this story of the monkey attacker can make me famous.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23527","Marshall","Me too. Guys, it will not. I can not do that.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23528","Ted","It's a little embarrassing. So what?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23529","Marshall","That's not it. Guys... I'm not assaulted by a monkey.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23530","Ted","So, you've not been mugged by a monkey?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23531","Marshall","Not at all.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23532","Barney","So what you're saying is that you got the monkey trapped so you give him your wallet?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23533","Marshall","No, that's not it.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23534","Ted","So you got the monkey attacked?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23535","Marshall","Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a gun.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23536","Barney","You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23537","Ted","That would be the right size.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23538","Marshall","I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a weapon. In truth, it never happened.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23539","Barney","I can not believe.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23540","Marshall","What?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23541","Barney","You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23542","Marshall","I would not?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23543","Barney","If serious, this is too funny.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23544","Marshall","Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23545","Barney","I, yes, but still.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23546","Marshall","But I can not lie on national TV.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23547","Barney","You know a long time. He told the truth?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23548","Marshall","Ted, do not do that...","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23549","Ted","I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23550","Barney","I still say that it happened.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23551","Ted","Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23552","Barney","Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23553","Ted","It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23554","Barney","False! They like to discover that they lied. ""Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth."" Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23555","Marshall","You mean what you done to him.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23556","Barney","No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23557","Barney","Passed. Who wants to do something to 3? (The two women throw their glasses to him the figure) Lisa, wait.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23558","Lisa","Yes, Neil?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23559","Barney","It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23560","Lisa","Well, I think I have not been completely honest with you either. I said I was 28, but in truth, I'm 31.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23561","Barney","31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world!","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23562","Lily, what happens","This is the belt of Planar 3?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23563","Barney","You know it.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23564","Lily","Well done! I have too much sleep last night. Can you imagine that I almost buy a gun? I'm glad you assaulted by a monkey.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23565","Marshall","You got me. I was just nervous. I got mugged by a monkey.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23566","Barney","Yeah! I knew it.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23567","Ted","Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23568","Barney","Come on, Ted. Why he would invent something like that?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23569","Marshall","Come on, Ted.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23570","Ted","Come here. Seriously, what's your flavor? It's intoxicating.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23571","Ted (2030)","Late the next night, we went on board the issue of Robin.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23572","Robin","Do not be nervous. We will sit down... It's that thing, whore?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23573","Ted","I know. Looks like something covered by a sheet. If you want to discover, you will have to do a story on it.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23574","Robin","It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23575","Barney","Dude, what do you do?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23576","Ted","I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23577","Barney","Now I want a weapon.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23578","Marshall","The monkey is there.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23579","Robin","Surprise. We thought it would help to bring you to confront your abuser.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23580","Man","Because of this incident, we will send Captain Bobo in a nature reserve.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23581","Lily","I bet he will love it.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23582","Man","No, ma'am. You see, we will separate him from his wife, Milly. They have been together long.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23583","Marshall","The name of his companion is Milly?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23584","Ted (2030)","And then the interview began.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23585","Robin","In your own words, describe what happened.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23586","Marshall","Well... I'd love to tell you what happened, Robin. But... I really want to know what's under that sheet.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23587","Robin","We talk about that. We speak your aggression.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23588","Marshall","People are attacked every day in New York, Robin, do we often see what's under that sheet? You can shoot it?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23589","Robin","We come back.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23590","Mike","It's good.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23591","Robin","What are you doing?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23592","Marshall","I have not really been attacked by a monkey. I invented it for that Lily buys a gun.","05","19","Zoo or False"

"23594","Marshall","What are you talking, baby? Of course I do.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23595","Robin","Great, tell it to America. Five minutes.","05","19","Zoo or False"

"23597","Lily","It's good. I buy a gun.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23598","Marshall","No. I got mugged.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23599","Man","So Bobo goes.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23600","Marshall","No! I have not been mugged!","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23601","Barney","You know if it was attacked?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23602","Ted","I have no idea.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23603","Man","Did you or not, was attacked by Captain Bobo?","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23604","Lily","Tell us just what happened.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23605","Robin","Yes, tell us the truth.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23606","Ted (2030)","And that's when Marshall realized that there was one thing to say.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23607","Marshall","Okay! That is the truth. I go back... back to bed.","05","19","Zoo or False"
"23608","Ted (2030)","And that was it. We never knew what really happened to the portfolio of Marshall. But we know that. Aunt Lily has never had a weapon, Robin's credibility remained intact, and Bobo and Milly lived together at the Central Park Zoo.","05","19","Zoo or False"

"23610","Ted","Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.","05","19","Zoo or False"

"23692","Ted","I mean, I put an online auction and I won the next day and I was accepted. I have just finalized all the paperwork.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23693","Barney","And that was fine with Blair Witch, and she tried to haggle on closing costs?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23694","Marshall","Try not to laugh with you that, man.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23695","Ted","So, I thought this piece would be the desktop. You see, a place just for dad. I mean, kids can come if they read a book, but no toy. This is not about to hold my love. It is rather a question of drawing a boundary.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23696","Robin","Whoa.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23697","Lily","Ted, you're barge. It will take years and a small fortune for it to be liveable.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23698","Ted","I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23699","Barney","Is it in the room with us right now, Ted?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23700","Ted","Okay, okay. I know. I have not found Ms. Mosby yet, but I will get it. Knock on wood.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23701","Marshall","Look out, man.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23702","Lily","Ted, you can not go on like this where you will make your life. It does not work like that.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23703","Robin","Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23704","Barney","The dumbest thing that ON've ever done.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23705","Marshall","Okay, well. Ted let alone a little, right?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23706","Ted","Thank you.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23707","Marshall","Okay? We all did stupid stuff in our lives. For example, I remember once when I put the rocket in the bathroom and tried to put them to dry in the microwave.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23708","Robin","My God, you had to be completely stuffed.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23709","Barney","No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23710","Robin","Children? Why...","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23711","Barney","Put rockets in...","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23712","Marshall","Oh, my God, guys! Great new game  ""Drunk or child? ""I was what? Guess.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23713","Lily","Bourre.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23714","Robin","Bourre.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23715","Barney","Gamin.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23716","Ted","Gamin.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23717","Marshall","Drum roll, please. I was... Drunk!","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23718","Barney","You know, I'm glad Robin have guessed. Because it is really sensitive and fragile. I talk about the times she cried during the song Clint. And while I whisper, I hope she hears me.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23719","Robin","It was not me!","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23720","Lily","What?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23721","Robin","It's not me who cried during the song Clint.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23722","Robin","Are you crying?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23723","Barney","I know it's silly, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23724","Robin","Not as much as me.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23725","Barney","I shall spin you 500 dollars if it happened to you instead of me.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23726","Robin","$ 500? No worries.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23727","Barney","Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23728","Barney","Wait, you're...","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23729","Man going","Hi, I'm here for inspection.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23730","Ted","Oh, great! I began to think that you would not come.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23731","Man","Well I'm here for a while, but I think the bell does not work.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23732","Ted","Hmm.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23733","Man","Oh, hey! The doorbell does not work.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23734","Barney","Wait, wait. You will inspect the place where now?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23735","Ted","Well, yeah.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23736","All","Hey! Hey! Hey!","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23737","Marshall","Okay! Well! Well, just remember that we all did stupid stuff in our lives, okay? For example, once I tried to cycle on an extension ladder to a roof of a two-story house. The only question is I was a kid or drunk? Drum roll, please.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23738","Marshall","I was...","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23739","Mother","Marshall is dead! Marshall died!","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23740","Marshall","A kid! Mom, are you? You always make a fuss about nothing.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23741","Ted","Hey, check the porch, huh? Go. I will put a gate there.Every Sunday here, it'll be a huge party sausage.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23742","Marshall","Hmm... sausage party?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23743","Ted","Burgers, burgers will be made.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23744","Lily","Ted, stop that. You can not keep this house. This is a huge mistake.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23745","Ted","Lily, listen to me. I had a plan, right? A woman, a house, children, and it turned out that the universe is really sh1t to what is the wife and children. So what is the thing I can control? The house I bought. It's not a huge mistake.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23746","Marshall","Exactly. Now, I currently drive the car of my brother in the opposite direction on I-94. Now that was a big mistake. I was... a kid.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23747","Robin","Wow, Barney. You've been crying about this guy or what?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23748","Man","Yeah, you have leaky pipes. But on the bright side, the pond in your basement drowned rats the biggest and slowest.The others, well... They go by.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23749","Lily","You see, you should have waited to see all the problems that home.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23750","Ted","You can always have problems with any decision, but you can not let that stop you. First day in college, Marshall knew he wanted to spend his life with you. And if someone was there to contradict his decision?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23751","Marshall","I know this is our second hot date but, Lily Aldrin, I will marry you.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23752","Man","Not so fast. (He brings Lily in the room) was some form of problem here. These hips are not suitable for a baby Eriksen.And that thing she does not have the right filter. This is a maintenance problem that never leave. And I know you think like this gothic look now. But basically, you've always imagined with a Spanish style? I would recommend you take a look at the options in the lease.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23753","Ted","But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23754","Barney","It was Robin! ""What! ""Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23755","Robin","Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23756","Barney","Of course.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23757","Robin","I made a mistake in letting you go, right? Your pen1s is huge.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23758","Lily","Boy, you've almost had us still.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23759","Marshall","You're always a little too far.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23760","Barney","sh1t.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23761","Man","Well, good news. I think we all will soon be out of here.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23762","Ted","Really?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23763","Man","Yes, I ended up downstairs and outside. Now, I could continue to look and see what I could do except black mold, bearing walls damaged, frayed electrical son, lead paint, water damage, fire damage, sun damage, off the cares, the floor is rotting... Oh, look at that, not termites. The chimney cracked, bats, rats, spiders, raccoons, the tramp, the gutter parts, the old fuse box, paint the kitchen which is not bad, but really swear the plates with the plans working. Or I could advise you not to buy this miserable house Guantanamo Bay, and suggest you break all by before a wind blowing through all son of bitches from here.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23764","Ted","And if I had already bought the son of a bitch?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23765","Man","I'll see at the top if all goes well.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23766","Marshall","He said he had found a tramp?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23767","Ted","Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23768","Barney","I see a complaint.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23769","Man","Found termites.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23770","Robin","Hey, good, good news is that the inspector has killed some cockroaches at the time of impact.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23771","Lily","Oh, stay there. Huge hole on the second floor. I just want to be sure the report is accurate.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23772","Ted","You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23773","Barney","Thank you. My God.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23774","Ted","Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23775","Barney","OK, buddy. Sometimes people make bad decisions in life. Like your mother.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23776","Ted","What do you mean?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23777","Barney","Ted, as you know, I've always been really, really addicted to your mother.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23778","Ted","Please, stop.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23779","Barney","Actually, Virginia and I spent a special time in 2006.Before Clint.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23780","Ted","What are you talking about?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23781","Barney","I wanted to be your father!","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23782","Ted","What does that mean?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23783","Barney","Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that b*st*rd stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23784","Barney","And that's how you got the pin? Incredible. You... So... here we go.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23785","Virginia","Here we go.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23786","Barney","It is a good time. Not much traffic...","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23787","Virginia","Oh, I love this song.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23788","Barney","Is it true? Hmm. I can... Listen... Ted's mother. I... I should really...","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23789","Virginia","Your pen1s is huge.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23790","Marshall","Again?! One too many!","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23791","Barney","Okay, that's good. Well, I invented the last, but everything else, I swear it was true. Come on, man. Your mother is a cougar.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23792","Robin","Wait, I thought you said that a cougar could not be more than 50 years.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23793","Barney","Okay, this is a Mellencamp.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23794","Ted","Guys, I'm in trouble. I mean, the best I can do is to improve the house and sell the property with great losses.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23795","Lily","Listen, Ted... Usually in life, when you make a huge mistake, you must learn to live with. But how many times you got the chance to take a mass break out and all?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23796","Ted","It's silly.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23797","Barney","Your mother and I were at second base.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23798","Ted","Thank you Lily. It was fantastic.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23799","Lily","A Ted Mosby, owner, friends, and if he can rent it, Slumlord.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23800","Ted","There... there is one last thing I should do.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23801","Ted (2030)","And my friends have not seen during the next 72 hours.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23802","Robin","It was our turn.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23803","Ted","Hi.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23804","Virginia","Ted, what are you doing here?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23805","Ted","I have not been able to make your speech. I was selfish and I freaked out and I'm so sorry, so... and here... ""A hand sign for the Dj? Dee made the sign... ""I pass. ""Mom, I love you, and I've never seen him so happy with Clint. And Clint, welcome in the family... what you both is what I'd really like to have someday. But in the meantime, health to you both. I love you. ""","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23806","Virginia","Ted... I'm so there... cooked. I'm 60% sure only that you're there before me. But if you're here, I love you. And you're the best son a mother could have.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23807","Ted (2030)","There was no reason why my mother could be with a guy like that. However, as you know children, be with Grandpa Clint was the best decision taken what did your grandmother.(Ted returns to the house he bought) Sometimes our best decisions are those that really have no meaning.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23808","Ted","Hey.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23809","Marshall","Hey, man.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23810","Ted","How did you know that I would be here today?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23811","Marshall","Robin told me. Happy Housewarming!","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23812","Ted","But I told you the last time I saw you I was coming home.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23813","Marshall","I know what you said. I also know my best friend, Ted Mosby. Listen... for all time, all the years I have told you... ""Slow! Not go too fast with this girl! ""You've not heard a single f*cking time. Your heart is both drunk and child.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23814","Ted","Please stay here with me, man.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23815","Marshall","That's what I do.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23816","Ted","I can... I can give you some ideas I have?","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23817","Marshall","Yeah.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23818","Ted (2030)","And, children, Marshall was right. I have not given up my dream home because that's the thing with the stupid decisions. It makes them all. But time is funny. And sometimes a little magic. It may take a stupid decision... and turn it into something sensible. For children, as you know, this house... our house is.","05","20","Home Wreckers"
"23819","Ted (2030)","Children, your Aunt Robin was dating Don until recently, but one evening, coming from nowhere...","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23820","Don","You want to install?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23821","Robin","Well... it's a bit early... but... of course, I might consider... I moved here, let me think.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23822","Don","I mean, you can install yourself beyond me to sit?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23823","Robin","Yeah, that's what I was talking about me too. As I said, let me think. I agree.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23824","Don","But... now that you've mentioned... you wanna install?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23825","Lily","You said what?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23826","Robin","I thought about it.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23827","Barney","You think about it? You hardly know him. In addition, the guy is a draw with a job that is worthless.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23828","Robin","We have the same job, Barney.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23829","Barney","And we could not be more proud of you, my angel.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23830","Lily","It still seems fast.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23831","Robin","You're probably right.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23832","Ted","You should live with him.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23833","Robin","Really?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23834","Ted","Yeah, you're happy with him, and i adore you as a roommate, I want you to do what is right for you.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23835","Robin","You wanna throw me out because of something with milk?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23836","Ted","It's super boring.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23837","Ted","Robin?!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23838","Robin","No. I have a system. I put the empty brick in the fridge to remind us to buy milk.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23839","Ted","Why not let the solid brick to remind us not to buy?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23840","Barney","All right. As a former... before you embark on anything, I'm meeting this guy. I think it's pretty weird not having yet met.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23841","Robin","Bluntly. It's as if someone was orchestrating things for this specific purpose. Okay, but you must promise to behave well.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23842","Barney","I promise.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23843","Barney","I'm doing this contortionist Portuguese, and I swear... it is so flexible, at a time, it was about me and beneath me. A top and a bottom! One and two! Which is empty?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23844","Don","It's good.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23845","Robin","And it was Barney.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23846","Don","It's not bad.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23847","Ted","Actually, I'm not sure.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23848","Don","I think it's great. But I pity any woman with self-esteem so low it would go out with him.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23849","Ted (2030)","Robin had never told Don she was out with Barney.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23850","Barney","I appreciate you, Don. Both, we love a good scotch, one likes my stories compelling. And we went out with Robin.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23851","Ted (2030)","There, he knew it.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23852","Don","So Barney's your ex and you hang out with him? It makes me uncomfortable.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23853","Robin","The'm not, it's as if we had never been together.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23854","Barney","In short, the arms of the Erasmus student have dropped and there fell of my swing. Seriously, I have not found a girl who can do that from Robin.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23855","Robin","How was your weekend, or any other topic?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23856","Lily","Atrocious.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23857","Marshall","Terrible.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23858","Lily","Twin beds? I can not sleep in separate beds. We should complain.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23859","Marshall","Yeah, you're right, I'll ask for another room.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23860","Lily","Yeah, I'll go with you in just a second......","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23861","Voice","Maid!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23862","Marshall","You can come back later? It takes a nap.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23863","Voice","It's time to return the keys.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23864","Marshall","We spent 18 hours.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23865","Lily","We missed the full board.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23866","Marshall","I lost 5 kg.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23867","Don","It's not weird that Robin is still friends with Barney?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23868","Ted","It's odd that we all still be friends with Barney.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23869","Don","I do not know how to react to the fact that she hangs out with an ex.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23870","Ted (2030)","Robin had said nothing either to Don about another of his ex. Me.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23871","Ted","Trainer with an ex okay, two at a pinch. sh1t, two is even better. Because strawberry...","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23872","Don","But if you had someone and he hung out with an ex...","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23873","Ted","Wait, sorry. ""It? ""","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23874","Don","He was friends with his ex.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23875","Ted","Wait, wait. You think I'm gay? Why you would assume that?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23876","Robin","Your teacher of calligraphy called...","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23877","Ted","And?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23878","Robin","Your ink arrived.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23879","Ted","Yes.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23880","Ted, leaving her room","I wanted to ensure that Project Runway is registering. The uniform changed to the Jets?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23881","Ted, an apron","I think there will be no creme brulee tonight. My torch to brown is broken.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23882","Don","When I found out that your roommate is single, I was a little jealous, but now that I know he's gay, so good.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23883","Robin","Ted is not...","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23884","Ted","But we still house boudoirs and hot dogs.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23885","Don","Thank you. Ted is not it?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23886","Robin","Ted will not be much there. It follows Cher's tour.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23887","Ted","Think again, Cher made some great concerts. But I'm not gay.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23888","Don","Lily, be honest. It's not weird that Robin train with an ex?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23889","Lily","Ted and Robin broke up there for years. This is not a problem.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23890","Don","Ted? And Robin?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23891","Ted","I'm so gay, eh, Donnie?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23892","Bartender","An apple martini for gentleman.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23893","Ted","Thank you.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23894","Don","You're also out with Ted? 4 people you consider your best friends, you've slept with 50% of them.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23895","Robin","It's just my friends.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23896","Don","But they are also your ex. And you live with one of them.I'm sorry. I have to think about all that.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23897","Lily, thinking","Her toenails are daggers.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23898","Lily, thinking","Great! And now he falls asleep. Hello, river of slime.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23899","Marshall, thinking","My knee itches. I'll just scratch a little.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23900","Lily","It should have separate beds.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23901","Marshall","Yes, a mini fridge. And separate beds.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23902","Lily","a deal!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23903","Don","I came to apologize to you. I exaggerated.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23904","Barney","Well, there you should also apologize. We said some pretty hurtful.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23905","Don","Not at all.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23906","Barney","That was after you to be part.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23907","Robin","Sorry for not having told the truth from the beginning.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23908","Don","I acts as a hysteric. It's not offensive, right?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23909","Ted","Still not gay.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23910","Don","Sorry, I meant you're both important to Robin. How about dinner tomorrow night at home.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23911","Ted","It's great.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23912","Barney","I can not wait, buddy.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23913","Robin","Thank you.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23914","Don","You're welcome.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23915","Robin","So long, guys.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23916","Barney","I have to get Robin.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23917","Ted","Are you kidding?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23918","Barney","I do not know what it is, but I want to get Robin.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23919","Ted","I know what it is. You're like... a kid who threw his toys and wants them back as soon as another plays with.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23920","Barney","I had perhaps not done playing with. I just left to play with something else for a while.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23921","Ted","You ready.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23922","Barney","Ready for what?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23923","Ted","To read the letter.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23924","Ted (2030)","Children, I invented the letter to remind me of the reasons for a breakup. I did it for years.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23925","Ted","Dear Ted future, never returns with Karen, because it is a pretentious snob. And she has deceived you. Sorry that you discover the way. You see? We laugh now.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23926","Ted","Dear Ted future, stay away from Natalie. And girls who beat you to the ground for no reason, before a cheering crowd. PS... Check out a shrink to find out why it has you a little excited.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23927","Ted","Dear genius relations, Stella has left you at the altar, you'll love me maybe more. And you will surely die alone. It's not so sad written in calligraphy.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23928","Ted (2030)","When Barney and Robin have broken in the fall before...","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23929","Barney","Hanging out with Robin was a huge mistake.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23930","Ted","Write it.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23931","Barney","What?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23932","Ted","Write yourself a letter. That way you will remember the reasons for the break when you miss.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23933","Barney","My pleasure. Dear Barney... the future... This ink is too cool.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23934","Ted","Right?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23935","Barney","You... and Robin...","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23936","Barney","... a couple were atrocious. It did not work. You always love Robin, but remember the other women... And above all, the other breast, and all the cool stuff you do with breasts... Y to the head, juggle... squeaker squeaker... I'm a hopeless romantic.And there are drawings of breasts.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23937","Ted","Get it?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23938","Barney","I understand. I really want it back.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23939","Marshall","Humans are not made to share a bed. s*x and sleep are associated, but these are two different things.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23940","Lily","I know. I love you, but I want this new bed is a sanctuary of my sleep and my sleep only.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23941","Marshall","Me too. And snacks, but that's all. You know what we should do? Buy a third bed to make love.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23942","Lily","A bed for s*x. For hot s*x and bestiality.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23943","Marshall","Awesome. That way, each bed will have its uses.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23944","Lily","Right. There will be two beds for sleeping, one for s*x, and I thought an ottoman for birthdays.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23945","Marshall","Baby, you come to revolutionize modern marriage?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23946","Lily","And how.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23947","Don","Do you like sushi?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23948","Robin","Don made sushi, it's cool, huh? He learned in Japan.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23949","Barney","It's too easy.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23950","Ted","Be nice. You want it just because you can not have it. Like saying ""Sit wherever you want, except on that chair."" You will be so...","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23951","Barney","My chair!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23952","Lily","From spicy tuna? My favorite.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23953","Don","I do too. It is more spicy, the better.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23954","Barney","Me too, man. More than you, certainly. Instance. Super spicy. I feel bad.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23955","Marshall","You will not believe. Don also has twin beds.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23956","Lily","We just had.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23957","Don","Great. Super.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23958","Lily","Wait. This ""super"" does not look great.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23959","Don","My ex and I thought it would be a good idea but they separated.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23960","Marshall","But I bet you have no special bed s*x.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23961","Don","It yes, with his personal trainer.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23962","Barney","This pepper is an ice cube in my mouth.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23963","Don","But if Robin decides to move, I bought a giant bed.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23964","Robin","I would love. If I move.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23965","Don","If you moved in.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23966","Barney","Don Tokyo... You ever do that... in Japan? Wasabi!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23967","Ted","Great! Give her milk!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23968","Robin","spit, spit!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23969","Don","We have more milk. Thank you for the reminder, Robin.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23970","Ted","Well, I hope you're happy.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23971","Barney","I stay on my position. It was bold and romantic.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23972","Ted","You were emptied from the top and bottom.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23973","Barney","Come on. Did you do stupid stuff to impress Robin.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23974","Ted","Yes, but not anymore, because I turned the page. Just like you.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23975","Barney","You have not turned the page. You want it as much as me, but you not admit it.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23976","Ted","That's ridiculous and I'll tell you why.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23977","Barney","For my biographer?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23978","Ted","Concentrate on the letter, ok? At Ted, Robin is the ideal girl for you, but she will not engage. You need someone who wants to settle. So, until Robin is ready for this, it is not for you. I still remember stealing the blue French horn, our first kiss, her eyes when she told me she loved me. And sh1t. I want it back.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23979","Ted (2030)","So that night, with Barney, we sat down to talk calmly and reasonably to the most deserving Robin.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23980","Ted","I stole a blue french horn for her... I was with her for a year.I wanted her to be the mother of my children and spend eternity in his arms.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23981","Barney","... I want to sleep with her, at least one last time. She is mine!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23982","Ted","It's not for you! And it's not mine, either. It is... to Don.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23983","Barney","Okay. We must get rid of him. You know, metaphorically.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23984","Ted","Of course.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23985","Barney","Or... literally. That's how it starts! I'm afraid, Teddy!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23986","Ted","We all talk!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23987","Lily","I'm worried. I do not want that divorce.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23988","Marshall","This is Don. It's not us. Our new way to sleep is only going to get closer. Now, get out of my bed.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23989","Lily","We can at least get closer?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23990","Marshall","Sure. You spoke of the beds. No, I'm not.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23991","Lily","Why?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23992","Marshall","I love you more than anything, but you're worse than a kettle. I'm surprised that your pee breaks are not as steam.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23993","Lily","You're not perfect either. Between the food and ants. But... I still want to be with you.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23994","Marshall","To hit me and slam me all night? I swear, as soon as you fall asleep, it looks like it push you arms. One would think sleeping with an Indian goddess.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23995","Lily","We're getting closer?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23996","Marshall","You speak of beds yet?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23997","Lily","Nope.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23998","Marshall","Come here.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"23999","Barney","Robin Stinson!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24000","Ted","Robin Mosby!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24001","Barney","Robin Stinson!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24002","Ted","Ted Scherbatsky. I would take his name. I do not care.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24003","Barney","Okay, wait. What do you say to that? It is being shared?I take up to 40 years and after you can have it.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24004","Ted","Who we laugh? It is with Don. We must accept it and move on.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24005","Barney","You're right. I go to you... I go to the bathroom. And then I'll break...","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24006","Barney","It's BarnExclussif.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24007","Robin","BarnExclussif, not quit. I have a double appeal.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24008","Ted","It's Teddy Bear. Want some honey?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24009","Robin","No. Ted, not quit. I'll remember. Ted is on the other line... and I think he has a problem.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24010","Barney","Ted calls you? Indeed, he has a problem.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24011","Robin","What's the matter?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24012","Ted","There's that you have beautiful hair. Front and back.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24013","Ted","We almost lose control.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24014","Barney","It's true. I'm going to leave before something regrettable.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24015","Barney","Robin, I love you!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24016","Ted","Species of b*st*rd! I brought the blue French horn!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24017","Barney","I brought the blue French horn! Ted has just given me.Sorry, I was there before you.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24018","Robin, at the window","Guys, what do you do?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24019","Ted","I want you back!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24020","Don","Come on, get.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24021","Barney","All right! Here we go! You, Me and Ted!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24022","Ted","Something to three.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24023","Don","Robin and I have to go to work. Sit down watching TV and will be discussed when we come back, okay?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24024","Ted","You abandoned easily. Game, set and match!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24025","Barney","We won the fingers in the nose...","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24026","Ted","Where's this great TV?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24027","Don","Right there.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24028","Robin","Thank you.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24029","Don","You're welcome. Good night, guys.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24030","Barney","Good night, Dad.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24031","Marshall","It was good. Well, you gotta go.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24032","Lily","What?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24033","Marshall","I'm sorry. It was great and you're great. But, I must get up early, so...","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24034","Lily","You throw me like that?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24035","Marshall","You knew before you start. (Lily gets up to join his bed) Wait. Forget your sweater. Nice try.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24036","Robin","The Teddy Bear, BarnExclussif.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24037","Barney","Dad?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24038","Robin","We get up, fuckers. You remember last night?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24039","Barney","Damn, Ted was torn. Embarrassing...","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24040","Ted","I'm sorry. It is both. We drank and we were stupid, but... We will do everything we can to ensure that Don is part of the group.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24041","Robin","Don will not be part of the group. Neither do I. At least for a while. Guys... with Don, it works well. I want to see where it goes. And I could not do it if I continue to hang out with my ex. It will not. I moved in with Don.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24042","Barney","So what's going on with Robin?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24043","Ted","You were right, she was just angry. It's been four days and not talk to relocate. We must never repeat this kind of sh1t.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24044","Barney","I agree. In fact... I even wrote another letter. Dear Barney the future, you think you want to get Robin, thou wilt not true. Let her. Sincerely, Barney's past.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24045","Ted","Let me see!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24046","Barney","Give me that.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24047","Ted","Ps... The top was for Ted. He believed? Fine. Pull yourself together with Robin, but say nothing to Ted because he will still go wrong. And there are still drawings of breasts.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24048","Barney","In my defense, the breasts, is not it great?","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24049","Ted","Too great.","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24050","Ted","Robin?!","05","21","Twin Beds"
"24051","Barney","Guess what I have behind my back.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24052","Lily","Wait, wait. I will find. Left.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24053","Barney","Not a good game but okay. Five tickets well placed to Robots vs. Wrestlers.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24054","Marshall","Robots vs. Wrestlers?","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24055","Ted","Great!","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24056","Barney","You know Robots vs. Wrestlers?","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24057","Marshall","No.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24058","Ted","But we think some kind of sport in which robots wrestlers.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24059","Barney","That's exactly it, according to the website!","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24060","Lily","Wait, wait. Who is the fifth ticket?","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24061","Barney","Uh... Robin. I know... She lives with her boyfriend and she said not wanting to hang out with us, but it's Robots vs. Wrestlers. Robots vs.... Wrestlers!","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24062","Marshall","Barney is right. It is impossible to deny that.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24063","Robin, on the phone","I refuse. I'd like to come but, I go out with Don Saturday. There is a Chinese.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24064","Lily","I assume you're talking about cooking, otherwise I would have other issues.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24065","Robin","I'm sorry, Lily, but I have a chance to Don. And I will not drink out with you every night... especially when ""you"" included two of my ex.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24066","Lily","I understand. You're right. We miss you much.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24067","Robin","You too. I gotta go. It is called? (She hangs up) Sorry, New York, I had to answer. Where were we? Bus accident.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24068","Barney","She said no? How could she? Robots vs. Wrestlers of our tradition is the largest group.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24069","Lily","Tradition? It was never done.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24070","Barney","It's Robots vs. Wrestlers, Lily. This is obviously a tradition. It starts like this. First, Robin moves in with Don and Marshall and Lily have a baby, then Ted...","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24071","Ted","Goes?","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24072","Barney","I was going to say ""was found eaten by her cats,"" but it's not good either. Everybody leaves me, and I like it!","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24073","Lily","Do not worry about a baby on our side. It is not yet started.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24074","Marshall","Absolutely. A small road.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24075","Lily","A small long road.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24076","Marshall","But you can see.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24077","Lily","Very, very far.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24078","Marshall","But you can see the exit sign.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24079","Lily","Oh? I see it.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24080","Marshall","You should put yourself on track.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24081","Ted","I understand how you feel. It is important friendship. In this regard, Emerson wrote a great poem, titled Friendship. You'll love it. ""A drop of crimson blood carries more weight than the waves of the sea...""","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24082","Ted (2030)","It's always been like that, with the group as soon as I tried to get some culture.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24083","Ted","You must try this Syrah. A taste of creme de cassis, red berries, oak heated... (Marshall and Lily are the kitchen while Ted sat on the bench) letter in September, baritone white. Of course! A lyric baritone! Which is higher than a bass-baritone.There is a key moment in the second act of La Boheme...","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24084","Ted","I try to add some class to our meetings. It's like this quote from Dante's Inferno. ""Consider the race of which you are created not to live like brutes but to follow virtue and knowledge.""Or, in Italian original...","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24085","Barney","You're right. I exaggerate with this story of Robin. What is an announcement? Wife Robin Don. I'll die alone! Ted eventually eaten by her cats!","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24086","Ted","Relax... It's for Marissa Heller.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24087","Barney","Marissa Heller? She looks good. Face, breasts, describe. Begins with the breasts.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24088","Ted (2030)","Who is Marissa Heller?","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24089","Ted (2030)","The mystery began when we moved there 10 years.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24090","Marshall","Ted! It was our first post! It is popular. It was... a golf magazine for... Marissa Heller. A catalog of wicker furniture, also Marissa Heller. And a voucher for a bird shop... addressed to Marissa Heller... or check it out... ""Current Resident."" It's us! It has mail!","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24091","Ted","Fantastic! That must be the previous tenant. I wonder how it looks.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24092","Ted (2030)","And that's how an image began to form. A picture of Marissa Heller, Marissa... the golfer Heller, one who loves the wicker... And Marissa Heller, ornithophilic.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24093","Ted","And since, in every mail we receive, the picture becomes clearer. But we know not how it looks. I will follow it as always...","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24094","Lily","Open it.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24095","Ted","An invitation to the annual Spring Jefferson Van Smoot, for Saturday night... in his apartment in Alberta! Friends... This is the most beautiful building in Manhattan! We gotta go!","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24096","Marshall","It depends, on the invitation, it's about robots fighting wrestlers to rule the galaxy?","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24097","Ted","It's about an open bar.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24098","Barney","We change the plan for Saturday. Evening Marissa Heller for alcohol and Robots vs. Wrestlers. But one of us should pretend to Marissa Heller.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24099","Marshall","I'm flattered but Lily should.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24100","Ted (2030)","The big night arrived. Our first stop... The building Alberta.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24101","Ted","This building is fabulous! You saw the gate and terracotta panels outside?","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24102","Lily","I just got a text from Robin. It says...","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24103","Barney","Guys, we get together. Lil, you can do... All you have to watch the guy in front, say your name is Marissa Heller, and it passes. And I repeat, to be sure, no accent.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24104","Lily","It is certain that it is not English, though? Okay! I do. I go there. (A young woman arrives) Sorry. Go ahead.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24105","Woman","I come for the reception of Mr. Van Smoot. I'm Marissa Heller.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24106","Lily","Damn it then!","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24107","Ted","That's Marissa Heller. She is pretty.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24108","Marshall","She has beautiful teeth. It should not need the reminder cards to go to the dentist.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24109","Lily","What do we do?","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24110","Barney","I do we go to the party, that's what! (He goes to Marissa) We met at the meeting of ornithophilic.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24111","Marissa","I do not believe.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24112","Barney","Lovers of wicker?","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24113","Marissa","No.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24114","Ted","I'm on it. This lift uses the same mechanism from its installation in 1906. It seems that Lamar Louis Skolnick, the architect of the building, has cut the panels himself.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24115","Marissa","A fan of Skolnick? I love the juxtaposition between the German Renaissance outside...","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24116","Ted","And some French influence inside! He was an architect with a poet's soul, really.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"

"24198","Marshall","Holy sh1t!","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24199","Lily","I can not believe!","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24200","Ted","Of course, hell is an interesting concept, is not it? I always liked to imagine it as Dante's Divine Comedy. If I may. Italian original... (Thinking...) I do not believe it. I recite the Divine Comedy in Italian original, and nobody makes fart noises. It's weird. I've never gone that far. I just seem to be an asshole. My God, I control myself! Listen to me, I am completely let go! I'm the biggest asshole on the planet. I wish someone stops me.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24201","Ted (2030)","And someone did. Children, I told you that earlier this year, we met with duplicates of ourselves in the city. Robin There was a lesbian. There was the mustachioed Marshall. And, of course, Lily the stripper. That evening, another lookalike appeared... Ted Mexican wrestler.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24202","Ted wrestler","Soy el conquistador de las maquinas!","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24203","Ted","I gotta run.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24204","Barney","Rule number 83. If something out of the baby ends up on my costume, I can touch the breasts of Lily.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24205","Marshall","Dude, what's your thing with the breasts of my woman tonight?","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24206","Barney","It is not I who make the rules.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24207","Marshall","Do you really think about all this?","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24208","Lily","I know. Maybe not.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24209","Marshall","For what it's worth, I think we are ready. We love, we are financially stable, and frankly, it would change that much the way we live.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24210","Ted (2030)","Lily still loves to remind Marshall that said that.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24211","Lily","If being at home with a baby, tonight we have never seen a dead ringer for Ted. It would make you what, if we had missed it?","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24212","Marshall","I blame the boy for the rest of his life.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24213","Lily","Right, for his daughter's life.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24214","Marshall","You're right. No need to rush.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24215","Lily","What do you say that? We agree that it makes no sense to have a child before he saw the five doubles, right?","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24216","Marshall","Sure, it goes without saying.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24217","Lily","So when we finally see a dead ringer for Barney, this is the message of the universe to tell us to do. And at that time, we'll try. Deal?","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24218","Marshall","Deal.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24219","Barney","Look who thinks he can come here and repeat the group. Well, you can forget. Pity, remake the group! I want to lose anyone yet! We're sorry. You can recite all the poems of asshole that you want, we never say anything bad on it, I promise.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24220","Ted","Really? Because there is a poem I would recite... Friendship of Ralph Waldo Emerson. ""A drop of crimson blood carries more weight than the waves of the sea The world uncertain comes and goes...""","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24221","Robin","Sorry, someone had to. I pay my tour.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24222","Ted (2030)","Children, let me say that over the years, none of us got a little separated at one time or another. We do not want, but it happens. But whatever had to happen, until now, and whatever happens, we will all, every year, see Robots vs. Wrestlers.","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"
"24223","Man","Good night. Thank you very much, I enjoyed myself so much. Willem Defoe...!","05","22","Robots Versus Wrestlers"

"24245","Ted (2030)","This is how. I gave him my request, she said yes.We were happy. And I's wedding day, her ex, karate teacher, Tony Grafanello, showed up, he declared his love, Stella and fled with him, leaving me there, my heart completely broken.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"

"24260","Marshall","It's normal.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24261","Barney","There is a street where it's normal. One clue  a giant yellow bird lives on.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"

"24277","Robin","He gave them money?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24278","Lily","Not given, lent. They said they would send a check, so Marshall gave our address. What prevents them from coming home one night, and maybe tie me? With Marshall, sometimes we pretend for real but it's terrifying.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24279","Robin","Why would you tell her anything?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"

"24282","Ted","Interesting. We went to this new film The Future Bride.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"

"24294","Lily","Yes, nice and called Ted Mosby.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"

"24309","Royce","I love it.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"

"24311","Ted","I'm bigger than him.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24312","Stella","And s*x is horrible. Once he fell asleep in the middle.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"

"24339","Jed","Tony?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24340","Tony","I must say something. Long ago, I left this beautiful daughter, Stella, to escape. And now she is with this jerk who does not appreciate the true value of this beautiful bride.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24341","Ted","What is your problem?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24342","Jed","You can not talk to me like that! I'm Ted Mosley!","05","23","The Wedding Bride"

"24344","Tony","Stella, I promised you'd be my wife. And I would keep that promise.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24345","Stella","Everything I wanted in my life was your love.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24346","Priest","Go ahead, darling, kiss him.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24347","Tony","If you still love me... Would you be my bride?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24348","Stella","Bluntly, doll.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24349","Jed","Stop! Dad!","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24350","Children","Take that, Ted Mosby!","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24351","Ted","Okay, he really said this time around.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24352","Royce","It was too much. I laugh, I cry. This is cinema, but it would not tell real people? It was so real! Why did you say ""Oh, no"" early in the film?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24353","Ted (2030)","This is where I realized that everyone has baggage, including me.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24354","Ted","Nothing.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24355","Lily","You must tell your story with Stella Royce. It will be released at one time or another.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24356","Ted","Why? So why should it?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24357","Robin","Because it is past the fifth most profitable films.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24358","Ted","I do not care. I will take it to my grave. It's a silly movie anyway!","05","23","The Wedding Bride"

"24364","Tony","The code.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24365","Barney","That's exactly what happened. It was all good. Even the thing with nunchakus.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24366","Ted (2030)","I was determined to make this film as far from me as possible. Unfortunately...","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24367","Royce","It was not great the bride?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"

"24369","Man","We'll see tomorrow.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24370","Royce","It may come? Want to see it again?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24371","Ted","Yeah, that was good.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24372","Royce","""Good""? Rather perfect! The only thing, and for me it is a very small defect, compared to other films, is that I understand why Stella wants to marry a guy like Jed Mosley. Just the name of this guy  Jed Mosley...","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24373","Woman","Royce, you're out with Jed Mosley, too.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"

"24375","Man and woman","""Encyclopaedie"".","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24376","Ted","Bluntly. Well, technically, this is the correct pronunciation.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24377","Royce","I was so happy that this loser is done let go before the altar. You know why? Because he saw it coming. And the best part is that he will live a long, sad life, knowing he has lost his only chance of happiness. And when he gets beaten up by the goat?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24378","Woman","Too funny!","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24379","Ted","Bluntly!","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24380","Royce","What a loser!","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24381","Ted","Bluntly! This guy's life was ruined by humiliation before the world. Too funny! It will take years before you can watch his family in front. It must be so traumatized that never again will he love or trust someone. It was insane! Get Moving, Adolf Hitler, a new king has arrived!","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24382","Royce","Ted, you're okay?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24383","Ted","I thought you would be interested to learn some stuff about this movie that you love. It is rotten. And you are all stupid to love.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24384","Royce","It was really bad, you should apologize.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24385","Ted stood up","Bluntly not Carrément doll... not...","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24386","Lily","You said ""not altogether, doll?""","05","23","The Wedding Bride"

"24388","Ted","I know! I was so excited... How do you know it's his sentence?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24389","Marshall","I wanted to see Avatar.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24390","Ted","It's good. I will emigrate to a country where nobody saw the bride.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24391","Robin","Good luck. This film is international, it's great.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24392","Lily","Maybe North Korea?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24393","Robin","I read that Kim Jong, he says it's his second favorite movie. Just after he made a film where the horse in slow motion.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24394","Lily","Sorry, Ted, you're screwed.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24395","Marshall","No, you know, Ted is not screwed. You know why I'm nice? Because I'm crazy baggage people. Most people see another person with this big suitcase, and they spend doing nothing. But not me. I look at them and say, ""Hi, stranger. Can I help you? ""And you know who taught me to be like that? A Ted Mosby. A decent and sincere guy who has faith. And you know what, Ted? Inside you, you're still that guy.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"

"24402","Ted","It's really nice! You're right, Marshall. I have to go retrieve it.And I know exactly where it is.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24403","Tony","The wedding is in 15 minutes. I'll never make it.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24404","Child","You can do Sensei. Give a roundhouse kick to love. Live in the heart.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24405","Tony","You're right. What am I doing? There is still time!","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24406","Priest","Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosley as legitimate spouses?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"

"24414","Jed","You can not talk to me like that!","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24415","Ted","I'm Jed Mosley. But Royce, missed it... in that cowboy boots red, it's not me.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24416","Barney","To be clear, you're saying that you do not have boots red cowboy?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24417","Ted","What...","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24418","Barney","I wanted... People want to know.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24419","Ted","They are burgundy in fact. I promised I'd make pancakes.And... I would keep that promise.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24420","Royce","All I wanted was some pancakes this week.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24421","Barney","Come on, darling, kiss him.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24422","Ted (2030)","Barney did not say ""kiss"". Still not ""kiss"".","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24423","Man","You must go!","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24424","Barney","This is outrageous. Thou hast embraced evil!","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24425","Ted","Royce, if you...","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24426","Ted","Do I always appreciate... Would you like me to make pancakes?","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24427","Royce","Bluntly, doll.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24428","Barney","Kiss it! This film is embraced anyway.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24429","Ted","That happened to me, it was pretty hard. I am not fully recovered.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24430","Royce","Let me help you.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24431","Ted (2030)","And like that, kids, my luggage no longer seemed so heavy. Everyone has his baggage, it's part of life. But like everything else, it's easier when someone helps us.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24432","Ted","It feels good to have you said those things. I'm happy to open myself to you.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24433","Royce","It's not that important. Me too, I was let go before the altar. Three times. The last time, because I lost all our money at poker. That's why I live with my brother.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24434","Ted","Wait, I thought you had a very small studio.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24435","Royce","Just the two of us. You'll see, he still pulls the duvet.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24436","Ted","Yeah, you need to go there.","05","23","The Wedding Bride"
"24437","Ted (2030)","Kids at this moment in history, had been found look-alikes. Lookalikes strange but funky, four of us. Robin There was a lesbian. Marshall... the mustachioed Lily the stripper... and Mexican wrestler myself. Yes, mine was the coolest. And therefore, it was all anxious to find the lookalike fifth, that of Barney. It was more important to some than others.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24438","Lily","We agree, it's insane to have a child before he saw the five doubles, right?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24439","Marshall","Sure, it goes without saying.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24440","Lily","So when we finally see a dead ringer for Barney, this is the message of the universe to tell us to do. And at that time, we'll try. Deal?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24441","Marshall","Deal.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24442","Ted (2030)","And one day, a few weeks later...","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24443","Marshall","You were serious with this story of the fifth lookalike?A baby is big enough to let the universe decide.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24444","Lily","I know, it's crazy. It's easier to let the universe decide. Why?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24445","Marshall","Decided!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24446","Lily","Wait 2 seconds! It could easily be Barney who tries to f*ck chicks.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24447","Marshall","I've moved up.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24448","Barney","Barney here.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24449","Marshall","Marshall. So, you're in the office? You're not, I do not know, driving a taxi, with a wig?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24450","Barney","Yes, I'm in the office. This is the sound of my stapler.This is the sound of my trouilloteuse. And that, the sound of me, ranking the company's directive on sexual harassment. What's new? I gotta run, great leader.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24451","Marshall","Barney's office. It was the fifth double.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24452","Lily","Marshall Eriksen... put a baby in my belly.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24453","Marshall","I hasten to add. This is one of the moments you dream about. ""Friends, Lily and I have unprotected relations. ""I have chills.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24454","Lily","We're going to say anything.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24455","Marshall","What? Why?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24456","Lily","If you tell them, they are invited in at the most private and intimate of our lives.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24457","Barney","You kiss? Go on, I'm not even there. But just like that, have a baby  big mistake. Now, show me.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24458","Ted","Uncle Ted is here! How you will handle the story of Santa Claus? You should be honest. Damn, I will disguise myself.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24459","Robin, on TV","It just happened... is that Marshall Eriksen will say to his wife while trying to impregnate her. Helicopter 12 is live at the scene, with ""Baby Alert  2010.""","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24460","Marshall","Okay. I tell anyone.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24461","Lily","We saw the fifth lookalike!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24462","Robin","Incredible!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24463","Ted","That's great!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24464","Robin","Bizarre. A Barney Brown.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24465","Lily","I know. Say what you want about him, but Barney is better blonde.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24466","Robin","True. The blonde does not go to any guy.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24467","Ted","I'm not sure.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24468","Lily","What?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24469","Ted","This was where I was swimming teacher at Cascade Country Club of Grief, I washed the mop with lemon juice, playing with natural highlights. Let's just say that there were some old pretending to drown. Unfortunately, one has really drowned. In short, blonde suits me.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24470","Marshall, thinking","Okay you two. We are in a delicate situation but very promising.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24471","Lily, thinking","If we play well the next minute, Ted goes to bleach their hair.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24472","Robin, thinking","This is wicked, can not... I just imagine. How do we do?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24473","Ted, thinking","What we all think? Nachos?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24474","Ted, thinking","I know. I really had for lunch.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24475","Marshall, thinking","Several people told him not to do something.Follow me.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24476","Ted","I do not care, I can eat. Yes, we would like nachos.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24477","Marshall","I love you buddy, but it is impossible that the blond you go well.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24478","Robin","It would not look good.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24479","Lily","Yeah, seriously, Ted, you not discolor hair.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24480","Ted","I fade hair!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24481","Marshall","It is not at all what we expected!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24482","Ted (2030)","The children, Robin and Don became such a duo, both outside and inside the screen, that Channel 12 asked them to lead others of their flagship programs.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24483","Don","So that's why Monty and I have vowed never to take drugs.Because the drug is bad. Not true, Monty?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24484","Robin","Of course... the chemical stuff, yes. But, what grows in nature, they can try, like, a couple of times.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24485","Don","We do not try to Shadow Zone, Monty.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24486","Robin","I think that we should not lie to kids, Moo-Moo!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24487","Don","So... what do you mean?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24488","Robin","I've tried drugs.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24489","Ted (2030)","Fun Fact  This episode had the highest ratings.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24490","Robin","What was that for?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24491","Don","Before you, I had given up everything. Relationships, my career, my pants. You have given me want to try again. I love you for that.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24492","Robin","I see...","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24493","Marshall","Sorry. You do not know me. But I wanted to thank you.In fact, you are someone very important in my life.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24494","Barney lookalike","Important? You mean, legendary? Marshall, it's me!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24495","Ted (2030)","Oddly, this was not the biggest surprise of the day.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24496","Robin, on the phone","This is rather sudden. Of course, you will have an answer tomorrow. Okay. Thank you. (She hangs up and then remember) Ted, something big has just arrived and you're the most sensitive people I know. That I may see you. (At the hairdresser...) You know what, it can wait.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24497","Ted","No, go ahead. I'm listening.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24498","Robin","The executive producer of WNKW saw our show the other morning and I loved it. They offer me the position of presenter, starting next week.","05","24","Doppelgangers"

"24500","Robin","Yes, but here's the thing... WNKW is...","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24501","Ted","Helen, dryer stops!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24502","Robin","Is Chicago.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24503","Marshall","You're the fifth double. How can you be you? I called you, Barney. And we talked about!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24504","Barney","Yes, I understand. My colleagues are oddly on the fact that I work. I know, I know.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24505","Barney","To make them believe that I break my ass, when in truth I break some ass, I made a special message. What's new? I gotta run, Grand Chief.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24506","Marshall","It was a recording? You called me Big Chief, my nickname special job.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24507","Barney","Come, Grand Chief.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24508","Marshall","Come on. Stops.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24509","Robin","Why it happens now? While all was well with Don. This is the never ending battle of my life  career vs. love.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24510","Ted","""Endless Battle""? Your career has crashed love for years.It's like the Globetrotters vs. the Generals. Crochet career in half, the love is greenhorns who deserve it the Italian league.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24511","Robin","I'm lost. What do I do?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24512","Ted","You really need to talk to Don.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24513","Robin","I'm too upset to talk with him. I have to avoid the time I decide what I want.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24514","Ted","It sounds logical. Sorry to not be able to help you more than that. In truth, I can not be objective about the fact you're gone.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24515","Robin","You did a manicure?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24516","Ted","No, I did not...","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24517","Woman","It makes a.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24518","Marshall","Why are you brown taxi driver?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24519","Barney","Oh, that. You know how I dream of making love to a woman from each country?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24520","Marshall","Sure. You're doing well in the Baltics.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24521","Barney","I thought the fastest way to circumnavigate the world in 180 days. Take a taxi and wait before the United Nations.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24522","Barney","It was the perfect plan. There's a detail I had not expected.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24523","Barney","The girls not want to enter a taxi driver. I worked hard on it.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24524","Marshall","I think so. I must confess to Lily that the fifth lookalike is false.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24525","Barney","What's the problem?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24526","Marshall","Lily decided that once you have seen all the doubles, we try to have children.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24527","Barney","Children!? No! Rule  no children under 45! You never read my blog!? He has improved a lot.","05","24","Doppelgangers"

"24531","Lily","The universe has spoken. Marshall Eriksen, make a baby.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24532","Barney","They told me, so I've prepared a few. I organize a ""marriage"". Tell me, Billy Idol, it's going to do? More on Billy Idol.If someone wants the real Slim Shady, it's there. This one was good. Robin, why do not you help me?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24533","Ted","First, I get lots of compliments. Then tell her.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24534","Robin","It gets no compliments.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24535","Ted","The other thing.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24536","Robin","It may be that I moved to Chicago next week.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24537","Marshall","Just to know, but it would do the same if we had not seen the Barney look-alike, eh?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24538","Lily","But we have seen, which means that the universe in its infinite wisdom, tell me of planting, and apply yourself.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24539","Marshall","I can not. I can in good conscience you plant.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24540","Lily","I know what's bothering you.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24541","Marshall","Really?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24542","Lily","The taxi driver looked like enough to Barney.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24543","Marshall","Well, there you got wrong.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24544","Barney","Time out! This is a group decision! You can not go to Chicago before we are all agreed.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24545","Ted","I think Robin...","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24546","Barney","Stay out of it, Brigitte Nielsen and Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV! We need Marshall and Lily.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24547","Lily","It was smaller than Barney!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24548","Marshall","It was the same size!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24549","Lily","And you know what? I think he was Asian. Yeah, this guy was a little Asian with a graying goatee and belly.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24550","Marshall","You forgot what looks like Barney?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24551","Barney","You kiss?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24552","Marshall","Why are you in our room? (Robin's turn to...) Why are you in our room? (Followed by Ted) Why Ellen DeGeneres is in our room?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24553","Ted","It works!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24554","Barney","Wait a second. Candles... flowers... I guess that Marshall has ""forgotten"" to tell you. The fifth lookalike... it was me.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24555","Lily","What? Wait, you were aware? You lied to me?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24556","Marshall","By omission, because this idea of ""let the world decide"" is crazy.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24557","Lily","Baby, you...","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24558","Marshall","We must control our...","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24559","Barney","Friends! We forget what is really important here. Ted is blond.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24560","Ted","Friends, I'm doing well. Robin has something important to say.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24561","Robin","It failed him.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24562","Ted","The other thing.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24563","Robin","He had a manicure.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24564","Ted","The other thing.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24565","Robin","I had a job offer in Chicago.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24566","Barney","That's why we're all here. For Robin to deter...","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24567","Robin","Actually, I already made my decision. Friends, I must accept.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24568","Ted","I can not believe that Robin is going to lose.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24569","Lily, thinking","Perhaps it's the depression talking, but Ted's hair beginning to be well?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24570","Marshall, thinking","Thank God, I thought I was the only one!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24571","Barney, thinking","Looks like a real movie star!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24572","Ted","And besides, it was a big mistake. I will re-stain the hair.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24573","Lily","Finally.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24574","Marshall","I told you so.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24575","Barney","Not so great that.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24576","Robin","So I was on the phone with Chicago.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24577","Robin","Yes, I made my decision. I appreciate the offer, but I can not accept it. Thank you.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24578","Robin","I'm staying.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24579","Marshall","Tell me... Did you see the real Barney driving the taxi, and you thought it was a little Asian pot-bellied.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24580","Lily","I know. It's weird, huh?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24581","Marshall","It's not weird. That means you're not ready. Sorry for wanting to rush things. Our baby can expect the real dead ringer for Barney.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24582","Robin","Hello Moo-Moo! Monty did you do an extra-fine pizza just as you love them! Are you okay?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24583","Don","You'll never believe it. I was offered the position of presenter WNKW in Chicago.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24584","Robin","You said what?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24585","Don","I agreed. It's been years I expect this opportunity.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24586","Marshall","Barney?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24587","Sosie","I'm single mountebank of Estonia. Who is this Barney?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24588","Marshall","It's just a guy we know who has a blog and really bad.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24589","Sosia","It seems that he is improving. Finally, what is it, ""blog""?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24590","Marshall","This is something that was cool 8 years ago.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24591","Sosia","Always cool. It looks pretty cool.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24592","Lily","What's your name?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24593","Sosia","Kristof.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24594","Lily","how Kristof?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24595","Sosia","Kristof... Sosie.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24596","Marshall","Really? Your last name is ""Sosie""?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24597","Lookalike","It's my name, man.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24598","Don","Wait. Trying to understand.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24599","Robin","I'm going.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24600","Don","Wait. Put yourself in my place. You can imagine what it is to be offered a dream job?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24601","Robin","I can. Good luck in Chicago, Don.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24602","Lily","Barney, why are you doing this?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24603","Marshall","Wait a second. Is it possible that Barney Stinson secretly hope they have children?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24604","Sosia","Who is Barney? Calm down the U.S.!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24605","Lily","Let me talk about him. He keeps saying that nobody should have children before 45 years.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24606","Sosie","I'd be interested to read what he has to say in his blog.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24607","Lily","But I think I know what happens. Yesterday, Barney felt obliged to say goodbye to someone he really likes. And it made him think... A baby joining our group might not be the worst thing.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24608","Sosia","Babies... this can be cute.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24609","Lily","And one day he will be the best uncle in the world. Because it Barney, he is part of our family.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24610","Woman","Excuse me. I heard you come from Estonia. So do I.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24611","Barney","Excuse me a moment. Estonia Baltic countries would complete!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24612","Woman","And I'm like you clown.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24613","Robin","Say yes to that.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24614","Ted","Yes.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24615","Robin","I can re-move? (Ted takes her in his arms. They sit on the couch) Is I'm the biggest idiot in the world?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24616","Ted","Think of all of us, five years ago, when we met you.Marshall and Lily were friends as little. Today they are married and think about the children. And Barney? He would never get involved with anyone. And last year, he fell in love. And me? I was chasing a girl, convinced she was right. Today it is one of my best friends. And you? 5 years ago, you would never put love before your career, but now you did it.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24617","Robin","Seems like I become more and more stupid.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24618","Ted","Just more courageous. We all looked for the 5 lookalikes.But eventually, over time, we all become our own doubles.These completely different people who look exactly like us. The ""Robin, there was 5 years""? This girl was pretty cool. Robin lookalike? She's great. (They are close) We drank a lot.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24619","Robin","I do not care.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24620","Ted","What? I forgot, I'm blond. I have blonde hair.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24621","Ted (2030)","And here's how my hair bleached prevented us from doing anything that would have regretted. Children, the world is fun.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24622","Lily","Yes! You're there! This is fantastic!","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24623","Barney","Calm down. Your husband is here. Trying to hide it, at least.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24624","Lily","The friends, follow me! (They leave) Look! The fifth double.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24625","Barney","This guy looks like me...","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24626","Marshall","Guys... Play the game","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24627","Ted (2030)","Children, you can ask the universe all the signs of the world...","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24628","Marshall","It's amazing.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24629","Lily","Is not it?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24630","Robin","It looks like Barney.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24631","Ted","Amazing.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24632","Barney","It's like looking in a mirror.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24633","Ted (2030)","But ultimately, we see only what we want to see, when you're ready to see it.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24634","Marshall","Does that mean...?","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24635","Lily","Marshall Eriksen... put a baby in my belly.","05","24","Doppelgangers"
"24636","Ted from 2030","Kids, there are two big days in any love story  the day you meet the girl of your dreams, and the day you marry her.","06","01","Big Days"
"24637","Ted","Nice! Where'd you get this?","06","01","Big Days"
"24638","Marshall","Stashed a cooler behind the pulpit. Beer be with you.","06","01","Big Days"
"24639","Ted","And also with you. Man, this is what church has been missing. Dude, you fixed church.","06","01","Big Days"
"24640","Marshall","Yeah. You're welcome, God. Nervous?","06","01","Big Days"
"24641","Ted","What? No. I'm just hoping it doesn't rain. Why? Do I look nervous?","06","01","Big Days"
"24642","Marshall","Look at your beer, dude. You always do that when you're nervous.","06","01","Big Days"
"24643","Ted","Barney, I really... I have to grade these papers.","06","01","Big Days"
"24644","Barney","I'm sorry. I'll let you work. But first, a riddle  What piece of women's attire most stokes a man's desire?","06","01","Big Days"
"24645","Ted","A sun dress.","06","01","Big Days"
"24646","Barney","Correct. What lightweight outfit, pink or white, makes the front of my slacks abnormally tight?","06","01","Big Days"
"24647","Ted","I really have to get this done.","06","01","Big Days"
"24648","Barney","Of course, of course.","06","01","Big Days"
"24649","Ted","Thank you.","06","01","Big Days"
"24650","Barney","""Sun dress,"" by the way. Hey! What are you nervous about? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. What flowing cotton frock...","06","01","Big Days"
"24651","Ted","Okay, I'll tell you. Just... There's a... There's a girl sitting at the bar. Don't look!","06","01","Big Days"
"24652","Barney","I want to see a pretty girl.","06","01","Big Days"
"24653","Ted","Okay, you can look. Just-just-just be cool for once.","06","01","Big Days"
"24654","Barney","I'll be cool. Ah, Ted. You got your beer label in a bunch over nothing. Listen to your Uncle Barney. You have no reason to be nervous. None whatsoever. And I'm going to tell you why in one word.","06","01","Big Days"
"24655","Ted","And what's that word?","06","01","Big Days"
"24656","Barney","Dibs!","06","01","Big Days"
"24657","Ted","What... You can't call dibs on a girl I've been sitting here thinking about maybe talking to eventually at some point.","06","01","Big Days"
"24658","Barney","You never called dibs.","06","01","Big Days"
"24659","Ted","Dibs were implied.","06","01","Big Days"
"24660","Barney","Implied dibs?","06","01","Big Days"
"24661","Ted","Yeah.","06","01","Big Days"
"24662","Barney","Ted, you are spitting on the grave of Sir Walter Dibs, inventor of the dib. It was 1652... The SS Dibs was lost at sea...","06","01","Big Days"
"24663","Ted","Look, I don't have time for a fake history lesson, so I'll keep this simple. You go over there and talk to that girl, I will see you in court.","06","01","Big Days"
"24664","Barney","And who's gonna represent you? Dibs on Marshall as my lawyer!","06","01","Big Days"
"24665","Ted","Damn it!","06","01","Big Days"
"24666","Barney","Where is Marshall anyway?","06","01","Big Days"
"24667","Ted from 2030","Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily had recently decided to take a swing at starting a family. Tonight was their first at-bat.","06","01","Big Days"
"24668","Marshall","Okay, I'm almost ready to leave. Let's just go through the checklist. Candles?","06","01","Big Days"
"24669","Lily","Check.","06","01","Big Days"
"24670","Marshall","Music to set the mood?","06","01","Big Days"
"24671","Lily","Check.","06","01","Big Days"
"24672","Marshall","Music for when we're actually doing it?","06","01","Big Days"
"24673","Lily","Check.","06","01","Big Days"
"24674","Ted","You know what? To hell with your dibs. I'm going over there right now and talking to her.","06","01","Big Days"
"24675","Barney","Oh, yeah, yeah? Be my guest. Fall in love with her. Get married. Just know this  When I step up to make my toast as your best man...","06","01","Big Days"
"24676","Ted","Actually, Marshall would probably be...","06","01","Big Days"
"24677","Barney","As your best man...","06","01","Big Days"
"24678","Barney","Ladies and Gentlemen... I... had dibs.","06","01","Big Days"
"24679","Ted","No!","06","01","Big Days"
"24680","Barney","What?","06","01","Big Days"
"24681","Ted's wife","Tell me this isn't true.","06","01","Big Days"
"24682","Ted","I had implied dibs.","06","01","Big Days"
"24683","Ted's wife","(she slaps him in the face) You know, you've humiliated me! (turning towards Barney) I had no idea. You have to know that.","06","01","Big Days"
"24684","Barney","Shhh, shh. You're the victim here. We both are. Let's get out of here.","06","01","Big Days"
"24685","Ted's wife","Or, you know, we could just do it right here.","06","01","Big Days"
"24686","Barney","We could just do it right here.","06","01","Big Days"
"24687","Ted","Fine. Have at it. Exercise your dibs. She's got her shields up anyway. She's reading a book.","06","01","Big Days"
"24688","Barney","Yeah. At a bar. That book might as well be called, ""Are You There, Barney? It's Me, Horny."" That is not what ""shields up"" looks like. (He points to Robin who is entering the bar, with greasy hair and dirty clothes) That is what ""shields up"" looks like.","06","01","Big Days"
"24689","Robin","Move. God! (She come over Ted and Barney's table) Hey. 'Sup, dudes? Fries?","06","01","Big Days"
"24690","Barney","Oh, good God, woman. You're a disgrace.","06","01","Big Days"
"24691","Robin","No fries for this guy.","06","01","Big Days"
"24692","Barney","Robin, seriously, I love you, but it's like you have squiggly cartoon odor lines coming off of you right now.","06","01","Big Days"
"24693","Ted","You know what, Barney? Just cut her some slack, okay? She just went through a breakup.","06","01","Big Days"
"24694","Barney","With hygiene?","06","01","Big Days"
"24695","Ted from 2030","No, with Don. A few months earlier...","06","01","Big Days"
"24696","Ted","Here, have some tea.","06","01","Big Days"
"24697","Robin","Thanks.","06","01","Big Days"
"24698","Ted","Robin, I am here for you. Whatever you need.","06","01","Big Days"
"24699","Robin","Okay, about that. Ted, listen. I know myself pretty well. And, some time over the next few months, I'm going to want to sleep with you. And when that happens, you have to try to say no.","06","01","Big Days"
"24700","Ted","Try? I will absolutely say no. Our friendship is too important.","06","01","Big Days"
"24701","Robin","Okay, you know, maybe I wasn't clear enough. I will come at you with everything I've got. I will stalk you like the lioness stalks the gazelle  careful, patient, deadly. And if you let your guard down for so much as a second, as sure as you were born, I will hump your brains out.","06","01","Big Days"
"24702","Robin","Okay, I'm ready to have s*x now.","06","01","Big Days"
"24703","Ted","It was a tough summer, but I think our girl's been a real trooper. She's... Is this a Cheeto?","06","01","Big Days"
"24704","Robin","No, we ran out of Cheetos last week. Oh, yeah, it's a Cheeto. Dibs.","06","01","Big Days"
"24705","Barney","Oh, you're exquisite. You must let me paint you.","06","01","Big Days"
"24706","Ted","Hey Robin, what do you think? The girl sitting at the bar. Shields up?","06","01","Big Days"
"24707","Robin","Mmm, totes, toots. She's here on a date. She brought the book because she got here early, and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting. Girls like to come across all classy and smart, you know? (She gets a giant hamburger out of a paper bag)","06","01","Big Days"
"24708","Barney","This? What you're doing right now? I'm getting a ""de-rection.""","06","01","Big Days"
"24709","Ted","Hey! How'd it go? You pregnant yet?","06","01","Big Days"
"24710","Marshall","Nope!","06","01","Big Days"
"24711","Lily","Okay, so, here's what happened. I was at home, waiting for Marshall.","06","01","Big Days"
"24712","Marshall","Hey! How was your day? Don't answer. No time. Bedroom. No, no. No time. Floor. No, no time. Against this wall!","06","01","Big Days"
"24713","Lily","Marshall, whoa! Wait. A big package just arrived.","06","01","Big Days"
"24714","Marshall","Yeah, it did.","06","01","Big Days"
"24715","Lily","No, no. It's a real package from your dad.","06","01","Big Days"
"24716","Marshall","Well, that's a little weird, but yeah, it is.","06","01","Big Days"
"24717","Lily","Marshall, look!","06","01","Big Days"
"24718","Marshall","A bassinet? Oh, my... He must've made it in his wood shop. Wasn't that sweet of him? Lil? Isn't that sweet? Lily?","06","01","Big Days"
"24719","Lily","You told your dad we're trying to have a baby?","06","01","Big Days"
"24720","Marshall","Of course I did. I tell my dad everything. My dad is my best friend.","06","01","Big Days"
"24721","Ted & Barney","Ohhh","06","01","Big Days"
"24722","Marshall","We have been looking forward to this magical, special night for two weeks now. And, sweetie, during that time, I have been... How do I put this delicately? Saving all my love for you.","06","01","Big Days"
"24723","Lily","I have read 11 books on conception. I have cut out alcohol, caffeine and sugar. I take my temperature every hour. But good for you for not playing with yourself.","06","01","Big Days"
"24724","Ted","I feel you, buddy.","06","01","Big Days"
"24725","Marshall","Ah, no! Don't even touch me, dude. It's been, like... It's been two weeks. I'm, like, a light breeze away from having a big problem. Seriously. (He looks at Robin, picking her teeth) Okay, I'm better now.","06","01","Big Days"
"24726","Ted","Okay, Barney. What's this going to cost me?","06","01","Big Days"
"24727","Barney","Excuse me?","06","01","Big Days"
"24728","Ted","Your dibs. I want to buy your dibs.","06","01","Big Days"
"24729","Barney","Two... hundred... and fifty thousand dollars.","06","01","Big Days"
"24730","Ted","20 bucks.","06","01","Big Days"
"24731","Barney","But I... Can I go smell her first?","06","01","Big Days"
"24732","Ted","No. (He takes $20 out of his wallet)","06","01","Big Days"
"24733","Barney","Fine. (He takes the money)","06","01","Big Days"
"24734","Ted","All right. Wish me luck.","06","01","Big Days"
"24735","Ted from 2030","Now kids, remember how I told you about a girl named Cindy? [FLASHBACK - Cindy's appartment] How I went on one date with her and it ended...","06","01","Big Days"
"24736","Cindy","Get out.","06","01","Big Days"
"24737","Ted from 2030","badly? Well... [END OF FLASHACK]","06","01","Big Days"
"24738","The Girl who was reading","How are you? (to cindy)","06","01","Big Days"
"24739","Cindy","Good.","06","01","Big Days"
"24740","Barney","What the hell are you doing?","06","01","Big Days"
"24741","Ted","That girl she's talking to? I dated her.","06","01","Big Days"
"24742","Barney","Oh, that sucks! And dibs.","06","01","Big Days"
"24743","Robin","So you went on one date with one of her friends. It's not necessarily a big deal. I mean, did it end on bad terms?","06","01","Big Days"
"24744","Robin","Well, I guess you just got to move on. I mean, it's not like you have a shot with Ready McGee over there, right? Ted?","06","01","Big Days"
"24745","Ted from 2030","Then I remembered. Cindy had a roommate. A roommate I only caught a glimpse of... But a roommate who, by every indication, was something very special. Was it possible? Could this be the girl attached to that ankle?","06","01","Big Days"
"24746","Ted","I got to see her ankles.","06","01","Big Days"
"24747","Robin","You're one of those? God, I swear, one in five guys...","06","01","Big Days"
"24748","Marshall","Lily! We kind of had a plan tonight, remember? Candles? Banjo?","06","01","Big Days"
"24749","Lily","Who else did you tell? Did you tell anyone at the office?","06","01","Big Days"
"24750","Marshall","Shannon? Start the music...","06","01","Big Days"
"24751","Marshall","I may have mentioned it in passing to a couple of colleagues at work. I'm sorry about that, but you know what? I got to be able to tell my dad.","06","01","Big Days"
"24752","Lily","Your dad is the last person you should tell! The man is too involved in our lives! It's like, every time the phone rings...","06","01","Big Days"
"24753","Lily","Hello.","06","01","Big Days"
"24754","Marshall's dad","Lily, Marvin Eriksen. I noticed you hadn't changed your last name yet.","06","01","Big Days"
"24755","Lilly","No, I'm gonna...","06","01","Big Days"
"24756","Marshall's dad","So, don't worry. I called the DMV, I called your Amex, I got that process started for you.","06","01","Big Days"
"24757","Lily","Hello.","06","01","Big Days"
"24758","Marshall's dad","Lily, Marvin Eriksen. I understand you and Marshall have been fighting. Well, let me tell you what works for me and the missus. Frilly French undies and a box of wine.","06","01","Big Days"
"24759","Lily","Hello.","06","01","Big Days"
"24760","Marshall's dad","You might want to try pickles on that sandwich.","06","01","Big Days"
"24761","Marshall","Pickles would have helped that sandwich!","06","01","Big Days"
"24762","Lily","The man has no boundaries. And I just can't procreate under these conditions!","06","01","Big Days"
"24763","Marshall","Yeah, well, you know what? I've already told him, so the damage is done.","06","01","Big Days"
"24764","Lily","So, call him and tell him we decided not to have a baby.","06","01","Big Days"
"24765","Marshall","Okay, so you just... You want me to give my dad a stroke?","06","01","Big Days"
"24766","Lily","Only if you want to give this a stroke.","06","01","Big Days"
"24767","Marshall","That's ridiculous. Lily, there is no way that I would ever... Okay, everyone needs to shut up so that I can think!","06","01","Big Days"
"24768","Robin","They're talking to a guy now.","06","01","Big Days"
"24769","Ted","What kind of guy? A cheesy guy or a cool guy?","06","01","Big Days"
"24770","Robin","Oh, a cheesy guy. Don't worry.","06","01","Big Days"
"24771","Ted","Oh, man! That guy is cool. His hair's all cool, he's got a cool belt.","06","01","Big Days"
"24772","Robin","Well, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy. Who's feeling nachos?","06","01","Big Days"
"24773","Barney","Oh, look at you, Robin. You're jealous.","06","01","Big Days"
"24774","Robin","Jealous?","06","01","Big Days"
"24775","Barney","Yeah, jealous, because she's got it, and you've lost it.","06","01","Big Days"
"24776","Robin","I have not lost it.","06","01","Big Days"
"24777","Barney","You lost it.","06","01","Big Days"
"24778","Robin","I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want.","06","01","Big Days"
"24779","Barney","Robin, girls are like cartons of milk. Each one has a hotness expiration date, and you've hit yours. I'm not saying the occasional guy won't still open the fridge, pick you up, give a sniff, shrug and take a sip anyway But it's all downhill from here.","06","01","Big Days"
"24780","Robin","I don't have to take this. But I do have to take this.","06","01","Big Days"
"24781","Marshall","Okay, so you just want me to call my dad and tell him that we're not having a baby?","06","01","Big Days"
"24782","Lilly","That's about the size of it.","06","01","Big Days"
"24783","Marshall","Okay, out of curiosity,when do we tell him about the baby?","06","01","Big Days"
"24784","Lily","We'll tell him about the baby when there's a baby to tell him about.","06","01","Big Days"
"24785","Marshall","So, he just gets no notice? He just walks into his boss's office, and says, ""I just had a grandson. I'm gonna be out for three months.""","06","01","Big Days"
"24786","Lily","Out for three months?","06","01","Big Days"
"24787","Marshall","Yeah. He and my mom are coming to live with us when the baby's born. We talked about this.","06","01","Big Days"
"24788","Lily","No, we didn't.","06","01","Big Days"
"24789","Marshall","I meant, me and my dad.","06","01","Big Days"
"24790","Lily","You know what, Marshall? Why don't you have a baby with your dad?","06","01","Big Days"
"24791","Marshall","Oh, okay, Lily.Why don't you have a baby with your butt?","06","01","Big Days"
"24792","Lily","What?","06","01","Big Days"
"24793","Marshall","I can't think straight! Why do you have to wear that shirt? This is not how I thought this night was going to go!","06","01","Big Days"
"24794","Cindy","Ted?","06","01","Big Days"
"24795","Ted","Oh, God, this sucks! Do you think she saw me?","06","01","Big Days"
"24796","Cindy","Hi, Ted!","06","01","Big Days"
"24797","Barney","Yeah, she definitely saw you.","06","01","Big Days"
"24798","Cindy","Can I see you for a minute... in private?","06","01","Big Days"
"24799","Ted","Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her.","06","01","Big Days"
"24800","Barney","Okay, will do. And dibs.","06","01","Big Days"
"24801","Lily","Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right?","06","01","Big Days"
"24802","Barney","Oh, you don't want my opinion on that.","06","01","Big Days"
"24803","Lily","Why not?","06","01","Big Days"
"24804","Barney","If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him.","06","01","Big Days"
"24805","Lily","That was really...","06","01","Big Days"
"24806","Barney","Whoa, a hottie with a body! Boing...!","06","01","Big Days"
"24807","Lily","Brief.","06","01","Big Days"
"24808","Barney","No. Lily, look. (looking at Robin standing at the bar) You saucy little minx. You sundressed up.","06","01","Big Days"
"24809","The man","Hi.","06","01","Big Days"
"24810","Robin","14 seconds! 14 seconds, and already some dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off. I... still... got... it. All right, buddy, you proved my point. Now scram. Nice belt, by the way.","06","01","Big Days"
"24811","Barney","Robin, you do look super hot.","06","01","Big Days"
"24812","Robin","Oh, do I?","06","01","Big Days"
"24813","Barney","Yeah, you do.","06","01","Big Days"
"24814","Robin","Thanks.","06","01","Big Days"
"24815","Ted from 2030","I braced myself for what was next  rage, fury, a possible shanking.","06","01","Big Days"
"24816","Cindy","Thank you, Ted. After things didn't work out with us, I got really sad for a while. But then I realized, you're not what I wanted, Ted, and I'm not what you wanted. I'm sorry I was such a jerk. I feel like I should make it up to you somehow. You know, buy you a beer or Yankees tickets, or...","06","01","Big Days"
"24817","Ted","Or set me up with one of your friends. No, I'm kidding. That would be weird.","06","01","Big Days"
"24818","Cindy","No, it wouldn't.","06","01","Big Days"
"24819","Ted","It wouldn't, would it? Any one of those three. Whichever's easiest and right nearby. And not the beer.","06","01","Big Days"
"24820","Cindy","I should get back.","06","01","Big Days"
"24821","Ted","Totally.","06","01","Big Days"
"24822","Cindy","Come say good-bye before you leave.","06","01","Big Days"
"24823","Robin","Say good-bye before you leave?","06","01","Big Days"
"24824","Ted","Her words exactly.","06","01","Big Days"
"24825","Barney","Dude, you are so in. That is so awesome. A high five doesn't even cut it. High six!","06","01","Big Days"
"24826","Ted","She didn't see us high-six, did she?","06","01","Big Days"
"24827","Barney","No. Good. That was pretty lame.","06","01","Big Days"
"24828","Ted","Yeah, let's never do that again.","06","01","Big Days"
"24829","Lily","Marshall?","06","01","Big Days"
"24830","Marshall","What? Lily, what? Are there more members of my family that you want to crap all over?","06","01","Big Days"
"24831","Lily","Here's the thing.","06","01","Big Days"
"24832","Marshall","I'm sorry. Hold on. Just... It's my dad. Lily, it's my dad, okay? I love him, and if he calls me, I'm gonna answer the phone! Hey, Dad.","06","01","Big Days"
"24833","Marvin","Hey, hey. I know it's late, but I just had to call. How'd it go?","06","01","Big Days"
"24834","Marshall","Dad, this is...","06","01","Big Days"
"24835","Marvin","Did you do everything the books say? Did you put the pillow under her back?","06","01","Big Days"
"24836","Marshall","Dad, I'm in the middle of something right now.","06","01","Big Days"
"24837","Marvin","Did it feel like a boy? You can tell.","06","01","Big Days"
"24838","Marshall","He's insane. My dad is insane. I'm so sorry, Lily. He's just... He's so... enthusiastic. It's ridiculous, you know? Like, who's like that?","06","01","Big Days"
"24839","Lily","You. You're like that. You and your dad both care so much. It's... it's why women fall in love with the Eriksen men to begin with. But right now, it's a lot of pressure.","06","01","Big Days"
"24840","Marshall","Baby, I'm not trying to pressure you one bit.","06","01","Big Days"
"24841","Lily","What if I can't have a baby? That could happen. I could totally let you down. Has that thought not occurred to you?","06","01","Big Days"
"24842","Marshall","Not even for one second. Not having a baby would suck, but the idea of you letting me down... that's impossible. That would be like aliens landing. That's a bad example, because that could happen. It probably already has. I saw this, episode... All right.","06","01","Big Days"
"24843","Ted","I'm doing this. I am going over there. Wish me luck.","06","01","Big Days"
"24844","Ted from 2030","Kids, nothing in this life quite compares to the sweet, terrifying exhilaration of making your move. When you just put it all on the line and go for it. And that night, by golly, Cindy went for it. So no, kids, that girl wasn't your mother. She ended up being someone else's mother. In fact, they both did.","06","01","Big Days"
"24845","Robin","Like I said, she's here on a date.","06","01","Big Days"
"24846","Ted from 2030","So that was not the day I met your mother. The day I met your mother was the day of a wedding.","06","01","Big Days"
"24847","Ted","Okay, maybe I'm a little nervous.","06","01","Big Days"
"24848","Marshall","Dude, it's just a wedding toast.","06","01","Big Days"
"24849","Ted","I know. I just... I want it to be great, you know? I want this whole day to be great.","06","01","Big Days"
"24850","Marshall","It will be.","06","01","Big Days"
"24851","Lily","Best man? You're being summoned.","06","01","Big Days"
"24852","Ted","Geez, what now?","06","01","Big Days"
"24853","Marshall","Ted, seriously, relax. Everything's... Okay, and it's raining.","06","01","Big Days"
"24854","Ted","Yeah. You were saying?","06","01","Big Days"
"24855","Marshall","You didn't happen to bring an umbrella, did you?","06","01","Big Days"
"24856","Ted","No. I didn't bring an umbrella.","06","01","Big Days"
"24857","Marshall","I mean, everyone told us that it might take a while, but... We thought we might be the exception to the rule. Anyways, we're getting back on that horse. I mean, feeling good about the future. Obviously, this goes without saying, but you won't tell Lily about any of this, right?","06","01","Big Days"
"24858","Ted","No! Of course! Absolutely!","06","01","Big Days"
"24859","Barney","So, this chick and I are going at it behind the Central Park Zoo. The Bonobo chimps start giving us a standing O, and just when I'm about to give her the same thing... What up?... I... I can't. I just... I can't. Guys, I know you count the minutes until you can escape from your humdrum lives by hearing how awesome mine is, and I love doing that for you, but I just can't tonight.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24860","Robin","What's wrong?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24861","Barney","I don't want to talk about it.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24862","Robin","Okay. Hey, you guys see Deadliest Catch last night?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24863","Ted","Did I ever! Deadliest Catch ever!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24864","Barney","All right, I'll tell you! My mother is selling the house I grew up in. All of my childhood memories gone, just like that!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24865","Ted","That sucks. I've been there, buddy.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24866","Marshall","What are you talking about? Your mother still lives in the house you grew up in.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24867","Ted","With her new hippie husband, Clint. The comfort of home is a little ruined when someone turns your old room into what I'm pretty sure is a Tantric s*x temple. With all the bamboo, pot smoke and '60s music, it's like my old G.I. Joes are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24868","Barney","Anyway, I need you guys to come out to Staten Island on Saturday and help box everything up.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24869","Lily","You expect us to spend a whole day packing up your mom's house?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24870","Barney","Of course not. It's a two-day job.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24871","Robin","Pass.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24872","Ted","Same.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24873","Marshall","Unsubscribe.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24874","Barney","You guys are adorable. You seriously believe that I, Barney Stinson, can't talk you into this? I got the Queen to give me a fist bump.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24875","Ted","No one believes that story.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24876","Lily","You may be able to talk the brain surgeons you pick up into doing whatever you want, but it's not gonna work on us.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24877","Lily","How did he do that?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24878","Ted from 2030","So there we were helping Barney pack up his childhood home.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24879","Barney","Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24880","Ted","Yeah, that's what your mom said.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24881","Barney","How dare you!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24882","Ted","No, she actually said that.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24883","Lauretta","Oh, dear, I thought I told you, that's just not going to fit in there.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24884","James","Someone order something tall, dark and awesome?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24885","Everyone","James!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24886","Barney","Bro!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24887","Ted","How you doing?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24888","James","Hey!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24889","Lauretta","Oh, my goodness!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24890","James","Mama.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24891","Lauretta","Look at my two sons. So big and strong and handsome.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24892","Barney","Mom. Stop.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24893","Lauretta","And how is my delicious little grandson? Oh, did he get the clothes I sent him?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24894","James","Check it. Huh? How cute is that, right? When was the last time you saw a diaper poking out of a Dolce and Gabana suit?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24895","Barney","Tuesday at work. Some of the senior partners are really getting up there.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24896","Robin","So, Ted, yesterday at work, I totally talked you up to that super-hot makeup girl, Liz.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24897","Ted","Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. What did you say?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24898","Robin","Oh, you know, how funny you are...","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24899","Ted","Guilty.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24900","Robin","Handsome.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24901","Ted","Who, me?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24902","Robin","Incredible lover.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24903","Ted","Really?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24904","Robin","Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I was all like, ""He knows a woman's body better than she knows her own, endless waves of pleasure just cresting and breaking for hours and hours..."" Blah, blah, blah. ""Orgasms so intense that you just black out."" All that stuff.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24905","Ted","Robin, how can I possibly live up to that review?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24906","Robin","What? You know what you're doing down there. Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it. We know this.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24907","Ted","But that is not the point. I mean, you broke the first rule of setting people up  undersell. It's like, if someone's never seen The Karate Kid, you don't say, ""It's the greatest movie ever."" You say, ""Uh, it's pretty good"" And then they see it, it blows their freakin' mind. Because Cobra Kai sensei's all like, ""Sweep the leg!"" And Daniel-san's all like... (high-pitched vocalizations, (mitates whooshing sounds)","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24908","Robin","Maybe I did oversell you a bit.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24909","James","Thank you guys so much for helping us out with this stuff.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24910","Lily","Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24911","Barney","I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24912","Barney","I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24913","Marshall","That sounds plausible.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24914","Barney","Hey. It's true. Tell him, James.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24915","James","Oh, yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap. He would hit it from the outside, hit it from the inside... He sucked. Coach cut him from the team, and Mom fed him that story so he'd feel better.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24916","Barney","Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this...","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24917","Barney","""Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10 00 in the morning, she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool. Love, Postmaster General.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24918","Barney","Thank you.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24919","Marshall","Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24920","James","Constantly. I mean, she put more effort into some lies than others.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24921","Barney","Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24922","Loretta","Oh, I don't know... That guy.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24923","Robin","Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24924","James","No. No, no. I heard Flip Wilson, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Meadowlark Lemon... The list goes on. I still can't get a straight answer about who my real dad is. And Barney's no help. He still believes every lie that my mom told us growing up. Not me. I caught on early.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24925","Barney","Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth...","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24926","Ted","Damn. Loretta really lied a lot to her kids.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24927","Lily","Well, she's not alone. Whenever Marshall was acting too hyper, his mom would suddenly decide he was ""sick"" and give him cough medicine until he passed out.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24928","Marshall","I'm pretty sure that's what stunted my growth. I hit 6'4"" in the fifth grade, and then I just stopped.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24929","Lily","And then there's the most popular parental lie in history. Santa.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24930","Marshall","Yeah, but that's a good lie. Like when we tell Ted he'll meet the right girl and settle down.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24931","Ted","I always find that reassuring.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24932","Marshall","You will meet her, buddy.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24933","Ted","You think so?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24934","Marshall","Yeah!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24935","Lily","Santa's still a lie, and I'm not lying to our kids.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24936","Marshall","Baby, it's Santa. Don't you want our kids going to sleep on Christmas Eve with their hearts full of hope, their heads full of crazy cough syrup nightmares, knowing that downstairs Kris Kringle is stuffing their stockings full of joy and stuffing his belly full of milk and lutefisk that they left him?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24937","Lily","Milk and lutefisk? Santa doesn't get cookies in Minnesota?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24938","Marshall","Yeah, that's just what Santa needs at 3 00 a.m. when he's battling a snowstorm over the Rockies  a sugar crash. No. Santa needs protein.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24939","Lily","I'm not lying to our kids.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24940","Barney","Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24941","James","Funny how all these girls have the exact same handwriting as the Postmaster General, Mom, and... home run king, Frank Aaron.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24942","Barney","Yeah, school girls... The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't... Who's Sam Gibbs?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24943","James","No idea. Why?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24944","Barney","Mom addressed this and never sent it.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24945","James","What's in it?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24946","Barney","Hey. (laughs) It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote... ""Your son.""","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24947","Loretta","Okay, everyone, lunch is ready. Who wants Sloppy Joes?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24948","James","Mom, who's Sam Gibbs?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24949","Loretta","That doesn't sound familiar. Who wants Sloppy Joes?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24950","James","There's a picture of me and Barney in an envelope addressed to him. And you wrote ""your son"" on the back.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24951","Loretta","Oh, no, that... It says ""Yourson."" For Yourson, North Dakota. That's where we took the picture. Lovely town. We went kayaking, and you two rescued the mayor's dog, which had wandered into the rapids. That mayor, Sam Gibbs, asked for your picture so the city could make statues of you both. I guess I never sent it. That's embarrassing. Now, how about those Sloppy Joes?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24952","James","If this picture was taken in North Dakota, then why is our old swing set in the background?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24953","Loretta","I don't know! I did my best as a single parent, and it wasn't always easy, and I'd recommend putting the coleslaw right on top of the Sloppy Joe, because it's delicious that way!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24954","James","Can you believe her?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24955","Barney","I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24956","Robin","So, Ted? You were worried that I oversold you to Liz. Well, I fixed it.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24957","Ted","How?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24958","Robin","I sent her another email. ""Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound like I was trying to oversell Ted. The truth is, he is a genuinely nice, down to earth guy, and I think you two would really hit it off.""","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24959","Ted","Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect. That totally takes the pressure...","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24960","Robin","""Is he going to rock your world in bed? No. But he's clean, open to criticism, and not into anything too weird. He's not bad at all. Not bad at all.""","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24961","Ted","See, now you went too far in the other...","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24962","Robin","""I'll be honest. The first few times aren't going to be that great. He's going to say 'Are you finished?' more times than a waiter in a busy restaurant.""","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24963","Ted","Stop!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24964","James","Listen to me. There is no Yourson, North Dakota. Mom... And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor. He might be one of our fathers.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24965","Barney","Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24966","James","Barney! You... You've got to stop living in these fairy tales that Mom told us! Bob Barker is not your father. Sam Gibbs might be, but Bob Barker is absolutely, unequivocally not your father.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24967","Marshall","I suppose you have a problem with the Easter Bunny, too.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24968","Lily","Not now.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24969","James","This address isn't too far. Are you coming with me, or not?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24970","Barney","So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24971","James","You're just too scared to face the truth. You're living in a dream world.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24972","Marshall","Maybe we shouldn't have brought these Sloppy Joes.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24973","Lily","Oh, what's done is done.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24974","Ted","""Ted Mosby is solid as a rock."" No. ""Dependable."" No. ""Rugged."" No.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24975","Robin","Why don't I just go to the Chevy Web site and copy down adjectives?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24976","Ted","I just want to hit that perfect middle ground.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24977","Robin","How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out? ""Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, and really rich, but lacks bladder control."" Oh, damn.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24978","Ted","What?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24979","Robin","That last bump just made me hit send.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24980","Ted","Oh, no.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24981","Robin","Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24982","Ted","No, they won't. They're going to think... Wait. ""Everyone""?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24983","Barney","""Really rich""?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24984","James","You ready for this?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24985","Barney","For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop. Just... just give me a second, okay?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24986","James","I thought you said that he... Stop.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24987","Barney","Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really... you know. I'm not crazy. I just... I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24988","James","Come here.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24989","Sam Gibbs","Can I help you?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24990","James","Yeah... you're Sam Gibbs.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24991","Sam Gibbs","Yes.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24992","James","I'm James Stinson, and, I think you may have known my mother, Loretta Stinson... in the '70s.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24993","Sam","Loretta! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I... I knew Loretta.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24994","James","My mother meant to send you this.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24995","Sam","You're my son.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24996","Lily","God, this must be so hard for Barney.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24997","Marshall","Yeah, but you know what? He took a big step today...","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24998","Barney","Papa! Look at us!nIt's like three of the same guy. Oh, my God, this explains why I was always so awesome at basketball. Guys, I'm black! Sorry. African-American. No. I'm allowed to say either. I got to go get my camera!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"24999","James","That is my younger brother, Barney. He just thought he'd meet his real dad today, and clearly, he's not taking it so well.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25000","Sam","Oh, my head's kind of spinning, too. I mean, Loretta and I only saw each other for a couple of months. You were two before I even knew you existed, and at that point, your mother made it very clear she was going to raise you on her own. I felt I had to respect her wishes, but I always wanted to meet you.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25001","Ted","Wait. Barney and James are two years apart. If Sam only knew Loretta for a few months, he couldn't possibly be Barney's father.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25002","Robin","He's also quite the detective.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25003","Lily","Don't worry. We'll... We'll snap Barney out of this when he gets back.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25004","Marshall","Or, he could just let him have this one.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25005","Ted","What?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25006","Lily","Are you kidding?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25007","Marshall","Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home, he finally admitted Bob Barker's not his dad, and then he watched James meet his real father. It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon. Can't we just let the guy be black for a day?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25008","Barney","Here, Ted. Capture the moment!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25009","Ted","I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25010","Barney","Man... I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25011","Ted from 2030","During that afternoon, Sam and James began to discover how much they had in common.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25012","Sam","Come on. You know this. Come on.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25013","Sam","There you go. Come on.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25014","Robin","Weird day.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25015","Ted","Weird day.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25016","Robin","Hey, look at that! Liz still wants to meet you. That's great!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25017","Ted","I guess. Wait a minute. You said Liz was a total ten. Why would she want to meet the incontinent freak show you described? You oversold her!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25018","Robin","Maybe a little.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25019","Ted","You said she was a ten.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25020","Robin","I did not specify on what scale.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25021","Ted","You said she looked like a movie star.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25022","Robin","She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25023","Barney","Dad, look how fast I can run!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25024","James","He's actually a really sweet guy, and he's great with my son.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25025","Sam","I have a grandson?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25026","James","His name's Eli.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25027","Sam","He's beautiful.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25028","Barney","Dad, you're not looking!","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25029","Ted from 2030","Eventually, the strangest afternoon of our lives wound to a close, and we headed back to Staten Island, where Barney and his mom had a long overdue heart-to-heart.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25030","Loretta","Barney? I need to talk to you.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25031","Barney","Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I... I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25032","Loretta","Listen... I always wanted to be enough for you boys. I think that's why it always hurt whenever you asked about your dads, because I was always trying so hard to be both parents for you. But I was being selfish. You deserve the truth. So here it is. Sam is not your father.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25033","Barney","Are you sure?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25034","Loretta","Yes. He's black, dear. But if you want, I can tell you who your father really is.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25035","Ted from 2030","And at that moment, Barney suddenly saw his childhood more clearly than he ever had before.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25036","Basketball coatch","I'm sorry, but your son can't be on the team. He's terrible.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25037","Barney","What'd Coach say, Ma?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25038","Loretta","He said you're simply too good to be on the team. It's not fair to the other boys. But that's okay. We can just play together in the backyard.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25039","Barney","Why didn't anyone come?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25040","Loretta","Oh, you know what, dear? Apparently, there was a mix-up with the mail. I just got this letter from the Postmaster General. ""Dear Barney, I sincerely apologize ""for losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party.""","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25041","Loretta","Barney.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25042","Barney","It's okay, Mom. I don't need it.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25043","Loretta","But it's your father.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25044","Barney","I already have a father. And his name... is Loretta.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25045","Ted from 2030","Kids, your uncle Barney grew up without a dad. And it always made him feel incomplete. But as he hugged Loretta, surrounded by the boxes into his happy childhood, he realized he had one hell of a mom.","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25046","Barney","Wait. Dad! James! Where are you going? That's the best part. Can we go camping?","06","02","Cleaning House"
"25047","Ted from 2030","Kids, in my early days of being a professor, I had one simple goal  give a lecture that changes someone's life. Then one afternoon in 2010, I achieved that goal.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25048","Ted","Unfinished. Of all the words you could use to describe La Sagrada Familia... Brown, pointy, weird... The one that really seems to stick is ""unfinished."" Why? Because on June 7, 1926, the architect Antoni Gaudi... Whose beard was also brown, pointy, weird and unfinished......was run over by a bus. And so, his greatest masterpiece would remain forever...","06","03","Unfinished"
"25049","Ted from 2030","But first, let's back up a few days.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25050","Barney","Ted, look across the bar. Three chicks  one hot, one kind of hot and one who I'm assuming is really funny. We ride! What's wrong?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25051","Ted","I don't know. Got a burger coming.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25052","Marshall","Bro, I told you, if you ever need a wingman, I'm your guy.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25053","Barney","Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25054","Barney","Hi. Barney Stinson.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25055","Marshall","And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25056","Barney","Thank you for your time.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25057","Barney","Fine. I'll have a three-way with hot and kind of hot while Giggles works the camera. I ride!","06","03","Unfinished"
"25058","Robin","So, get this  Last night, I was watching TV, and it turns out, some random satellite channel picks up a certain local Chicago newscast.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25059","TV Speaker","And now, the 11 00 News with Don Frank.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25060","Ted","Oh, man, it's bad enough to have to go through a horrible breakup, but then have that person pop up on your TV? Are you okay?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25061","Robin","Well, I'll admit, at first, I felt a little weird. But after the initial shock, I realized something  I've moved on. Finished with that. It was a peaceful moment of closure.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25062","Ted","That's great. Good for you.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25063","Robin","Yeah, thank you.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25064","Lily","Where's the poop, Robin?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25065","Robin","Excuse me?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25066","Lily","When I was a kid, I had a dog named Bean. Whenever he made the face that you're making right now, you just knew he pooped somewhere in the house. Where's the poop, Robin?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25067","Robin","I don't know what you're talking about.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25068","Lily","Where's the poop, Robin?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25069","Robin","There's no poop.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25070","Lily","Where's the poop?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25071","Robin","Okay. So it wasn't entirely a peaceful moment of closure.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25072","Robin","Hey, Don, here's some breaking news  there's a zit breaking ou on your forehead. Finished with that.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25073","Robin","Look, I'm not proud, but Don left so quickly that I never got the chance to have that final showdown. So yelling at him, even on TV, felt kind of good. And you know what? Now I truly am over him.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25074","Ted","That's great.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25075","Robin","Thank you.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25076","Lily","Good for you. Where's the poop, Robin?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25077","Robin","Damn it! Okay, in the process of truly getting over him, I may have called him and left an... indelicate voice mail.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25078","Robin","I am gonna kill you. I'm gonna fly to Chicago, kill you, put your stupid face on a deep dish pizza and eat it. And then maybe catch a Bears game. But mostly the killing and eating your face thing.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25079","Lily","Give me your phone. We're deleting Don's number.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25080","Robin","Don't worry. I am never doing that again. It was a one-time thing.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25081","Lily","Prove it. Delete contact.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25082","Robin","There. Deleted.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25083","Marshall","Back already. How was flying solo? And by ""solo,"" I mean so low that you got shot down.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25084","Barney","Look, I didn't get shot down. Trust me, I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. This is all part of the plan. After initial contact, I'm now in the ignoring phase.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25085","Lily","Barney, why can't you just take a girl out to dinner like a normal person?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25086","Barney","Golden rule  I do not buy dinner to get the yes. Dinner's a very intimate activity. It requires a level of connection and eye contact that s*x just doesn't. Call me old-fashioned, but I need to have s*x with a girl at least three times before I'll even consider having dinner with her.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25087","Ted from 2030","The next day, at the university, I had a surprise visitor.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25088","Ted","What are you doing here? Oh, God! You're dating one of my students. It's Rachel, isn't it? Barney, I know she wears provocative sweaters, but she's 19! Now I'm gonna have to hear all about it, right? Go on, tell me every detail.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25089","Barney","No, you pent-up old perv. I brought you a present. Recognize this?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25090","Ted","It's my building.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25091","Ted from 2030","Kids, you may remember that, a few years earlier, I was chosen to design the new Manhattan headquarters for Goliath National Bank. It was the opportunity every architect dreams about. And when the project was ultimately scrapped... it broke my heart.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25092","Barney","Do you remember how awesome it was to be co-workers... Nay, bro-workers?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25093","Ted","Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean...","06","03","Unfinished"
"25094","Barney","Ted Mosby, it's back on. We're gonna build your building.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25095","Marshall","This is awesome... You're designing our new headquarters. Now, there will be voices that tell you a hockey rink on the roof is unfeasible. You've got to shut those voices out.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25096","Ted","Actually, I think I'm gonna say no.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25097","Robin","No? Are you kidding me?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25098","Lily","But designing a building in New York City is your lifelong dream.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25099","Ted","I do not want to work for GNB again. Those guys are evil. No offense, Marshall.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25100","Marshall","Dude, none taken. Yes, GNB is, the Empire from Star Wars. But the Death Star's gonna get built either way. And don't you think the architect of the Death Star is pretty psyched to have that thing on his space resume? I mean, yes, his design was flawed in the sense that a single bullet fired into a particular vent would explode the whole thing.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25101","Ted","For all we know, that was the contractor's fault.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25102","Marshall","But that won't happen on your watch... you know why? Because you're Ted Mosby! And you are gonna design the most beautiful, ventless, Rebel-proof building in Manhattan, with clearly marked emergency stops for every trash compactor on the detention level.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25103","Ted","Look, I know this is hard to understand, but right now, I have a quiet, simple, happy little life. And I like it that way. I know what my answer has to be.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25104","Ted","I can't take the job, Barney. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25105","Barney","Of course not.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25106","Ted","All right.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25107","Ted from 2030","And I thought that was the end of the story. But then that night...","06","03","Unfinished"
"25108","Ted","I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Barney, back me up. Barney. Dude, this is important.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25109","Barney","I need another drink.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25110","Ted","Marshall, you want anything?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25111","Marshall","No, I'm fine.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25112","Ted","Okay, I get that he's mad at me for turning down the job, but acting like I'm not even here?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25113","Marshall","Wait, you turned down the job? When?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25114","Ted","This morning.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25115","Marshall","That's so weird. Just, like, an hour ago, when we were leaving work...","06","03","Unfinished"
"25116","Marshall","So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25117","Barney","Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25118","Ted","Am I wrong or is that exactly what Barney says when he's putting the moves on a girl?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25119","Marshall","Exactly. I mean, it's almost like he's putting the moves on you.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25120","Ted","Yeah, more like the opposite. He's been ignoring me all night. Barney wants me to take the job so bad he's putting the moves on me?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25121","Marshall","I hope that's his end game. Actually, I don't. I like you two together.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25122","Ted","I don't buy it. That's crazy, even for Barney.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25123","Marshall","Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25124","Barney","Chrissy, I love your glasses.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25125","Chrissy","Really?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25126","Barney","They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25127","Marshall","The backhanded compliment to lower her self-esteem... a proven winner.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25128","Ted","But Barney hasn't done...","06","03","Unfinished"
"25129","Barney","Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community. You stick with it. To Ted.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25130","Robin","Hey, Lily!","06","03","Unfinished"
"25131","Lily","Don't ""Hey, Lily"" me. I smelled poop all the way from the hallway.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25132","Robin","Oh, no, not this again.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25133","Lily","Where's the poop, Robin?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25134","Robin","Okay, I left Don another message.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25135","Robin","""This just in"" is what I'm gonna say when I'm stabbing you.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25136","Lily","But that's impossible. You deleted his number.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25137","Robin","I tried to. But then this thing popped up on my phone that said, ""Are you sure?"" And I wasn't sure. I can't lie to my phone.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25138","Lily","Oh, sweetie, I totally understand. Delete it!","06","03","Unfinished"
"25139","Robin","It's not that easy, okay? You're not just deleting a number, you're deleting a part of your life. You know, all those memories, all those experiences. It's like you're admitting they're gone forever.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25140","Lily","I know, sweetie. I know. Delete it!","06","03","Unfinished"
"25141","Robin","Okay, if it's that easy, I'm gonna delete one of your numbers from your phone, see how you like it.","06","03","Unfinished"

"25143","Robin","Super Kicks Karate.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25144","Lily","No, not that one. That's my dojo.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25145","Robin","You have a dojo?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25146","Lily","I took an introductory karate class.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25147","Lily","Ops, wrong room. Where do the grown-ups go for the real karate class?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25148","Boy","What's the matter, lady? You scared?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25149","Lily","Of you? Please. I'm a kindergarten teacher.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25150","Boy","I hated kindergarten. All three times.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25151","Lily","But I'm totally gonna sign up for more lessons.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25152","Robin","How long ago did you take that class?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25153","Lily","I don't know. It was around the time when everyone was going, ""Wassuuuuuuup!""","06","03","Unfinished"
"25154","Robin","How do you even remember that? Lily, this is a number that you will never dial again.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25155","Lily","I might.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25156","Robin","No, no. But you keep it in your phone because it reminds you of a version of yourself that you could be, even if it's a version of yourself that you'll never become. And that's okay.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25157","Lily","No, it's not. Okay, you know what? There, gone. Your move, Scherbatsky.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25158","Ted","I finally know what your kind goes through. I get it now.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25159","Robin","For the last time, I don't care how big it was, it is not the same as giving birth.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25160","Marshall","No! Barney's been ""putting the moves"" on Ted.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25161","Lily","Oh, that sucks. Although I like you two together.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25162","Marshall","No, he's been doing it to try to get Ted to design the new GNB Tower.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25163","Robin","Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25164","Barney","Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks! (...) Man, the courtside Knicks seats that are available to all upper level GNB employees are too close to the action. I keep getting sweat on my suit. It sucks! (...) Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks!","06","03","Unfinished"
"25165","Ted","He did.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25166","Robin","And the intense eye contact thing?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25167","Barney","So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25168","Ted","Okay. Yep.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25169","Robin","And the thing where he establishs intimacy through physical contact?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25170","Ted","You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25171","Barney","That is so true.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25172","Ted","Yeah... Cream cheese has a mild flav-flavor so it... it balances out the spiciness of the jal... the spiciness of the... Dude!","06","03","Unfinished"
"25173","Robin","So at any point in this did you say, ""Barney, I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. I am not taking that job""?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25174","Ted","Well, I mean, not exactly in those...","06","03","Unfinished"
"25175","Lily","You're loving this.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25176","Ted","No.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25177","Lily","You are. You're loving the attention.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25178","Ted","It's nice to be wanted, okay? And, yes, this is a new vest. Thank you all for noticing. Oh, that's right, you didn't. Barney did!","06","03","Unfinished"
"25179","Robin","Oh, Teddy, you are so going to spread your legs and design that building.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25180","Ted","I am not that kind of architect. So get this...","06","03","Unfinished"
"25181","Lily","Robin never deleted Don's number.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25182","Robin","Oh, everyone thinks it's so easy. Give me your phone. Let's delete one of yours.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25183","Marshall","Okay. No problem. If you can find a number that I don't need or shouldn't have in here, be my guest, but good luck. I keep my phone tight.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25184","Robin","Edwin.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25185","Marshall","Oh, no, not that one. That's the booker for the club that my band plays at. You know, my all-lawyer funk band... you remember... The Funk, the Whole Funk and Nothing but the Funk.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25186","Robin","You guys played one gig four years ago. I'm deleting it.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25187","Marshall","No, no, we're gonna... we're gonna play another gig again. Probably really soon. It's just we all got super busy, and... We're not going to play another gig again, are we?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25188","Lily","Probably not, baby.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25189","Robin","See, it's hard to hit that delete button, isn't it?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25190","Marshall","Well, it's just that without that number in my phone, I'm just a corporate lawyer working 60 very un-funky hours a week.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25191","Robin","Sorry, Marshall. But if I have to, you have to.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25192","Lily","Okay. Your turn.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25193","Ted","Barney, I gotta tell you something.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25194","Barney","Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25195","Ted","Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25196","Barney","Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25197","Ted","Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, ""pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more."" It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, ""Oh, God, I never should have said no.""","06","03","Unfinished"
"25198","Marshall","It's not a move, dude. I executed the paperwork for the new architect this morning. Barney wasn't lying.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25199","Ted","Oh, God, I never should have said no! Come on, GNB didn't really hire a new architect. This is just one of Barney's moves.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25200","Marshall","It's not a move, dude. The senior partners were getting impatient. I thought you didn't even want the job.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25201","Ted","I didn't! I don't! I don't. I don't!","06","03","Unfinished"
"25202","Ted","Okay, I'll do it!","06","03","Unfinished"
"25203","Barney","What? Ted, it's too late.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25204","Ted","I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25205","Barney","Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank...","06","03","Unfinished"
"25206","Marshall","Okay, it's a move.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25207","Ted","What?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25208","Barney","Dude!","06","03","Unfinished"
"25209","Marshall","There is no other architect. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied. I was being Barney's wingman, and I never get to be the wingman.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25210","Ted","You guys lied to me?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25211","Barney","You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25212","Marshall","I can do better. Take me back. You son of a bitch!","06","03","Unfinished"
"25213","Ted","Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25214","Barney","We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25215","Ted","No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women...","06","03","Unfinished"
"25216","Barney","236.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25217","Ted","...before me fell for. Wow, respect.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25218","Marshall","No... Ted... you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25219","Barney","Come on, Ted! This is your dream.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25220","Ted","No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25221","Robin","Hey, guys.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25222","Lily","Where's the poop, Robin?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25223","Robin","How do you do that? You are like a bomb-sniffing dog, except with poop. You are a poop-sniffing dog.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25224","Marshall","I think that's just called a dog.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25225","Lily","Where's the poop, Robin?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25226","Robin","Fine. I called Don again.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25227","Robin","Hey, Don! It's Robin again. Look, I am sorry for all the calls. It's just, I saw you on the news, and it made me a little crazy for a minute. I guess I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought. But I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to kill you. No... No, I'm not. I am happy for you. And that Asian slut on your Facebook page. She's dead, too.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25228","Lily","I thought you deleted his number.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25229","Robin","I did, but it turns out, I memorized it. You can't delete contacts from your brain, Lily.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25230","Lily","Well, you have to try. If you ever want to have closure...","06","03","Unfinished"
"25231","Robin","I am never going to have closure. Okay? Closure doesn't exist. Okay, one day, Don and I are moving in together, and the next thing I know, he's on a plane to Chicago. It just... ended. And no matter how much I try to forget that it happened, it will have never not happened. Don and I will always be a loose end. We'll always be...","06","03","Unfinished"
"25232","Ted","Unfinished. Gaudi, to his credit, never gave up on his dream, but that's not usually how it goes. I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy, weird church from getting built. Most of the time, it's just too difficult or too expensive, or too scary. It's only once you've stopped that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it. But it's always there. And until you finish it, it will always be...","06","03","Unfinished"
"25233","Ted","Hey, Barney. Hey, Rachel. Rachel, why aren't you in class?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25234","Rachel","Why aren't you in class?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25235","Barney","Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class? You son of a bitch. I'll call Marshall. We'll draw up the contract.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25236","Ted","Not so fast. I'm not that easy.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25237","Ted from 2030","And so I made Barney break his golden rule. I made him take me out to dinner before I finally gave him the thing he always got. Yes. And even though it didn't happen right away...","06","03","Unfinished"
"25238","TV Speaker","And now, the 11 00 News with Don Frank.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25239","Voice","Bueno?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25240","Robin","Who is this?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25241","Voice","No hablo ingles. Quien es?","06","03","Unfinished"
"25242","Robin","I'm sorry. Is this 917-456... I'm sorry, 465... No, wait.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25243","Ted from 2030","Robin finally got some closure, too.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25244","Robin","Sorry. Wrong number. Finished with that.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25245","Lily","Hey, punk! Bit of advice. Next time you step on a kindergarten teacher's neck, you better finish the job.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25246","Man","I knew this day would come.","06","03","Unfinished"
"25247","Barney","I cannot stop staring at that girl's face.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25248","Ted","Face. Huh. That's your weirdest nickname for boobs yet.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25249","Barney","No, Ted, I'm really looking at her face.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25250","Lily","Aw... That's actually really sweet.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25251","Barney","Puffy cheeks, smudged mascara, slightly red nose... That girl was just crying. She's so sad and defenseless. Anyone have a condom?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25252","Everyone","Oh! Oh, God! No, no, no!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25253","Lily","That's it! You know what? Five-minute time-out! Corner booth! Now.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25254","Marsall","Hey, get this. You know my friend Max from law school? He's at Gregor's Steakhouse downtown, and Woody Allen is sitting two tables over. He wants us to come check it out.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25255","Robin","I don't know, it could be cool. I've never seen Woody Allen.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25256","Marsall","What?! Robin, how can you be a New Yorker and never have seen Woody Allen?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25257","Robin","I have seen plenty of other famous people. Last week I saw... Maury Povich.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25258","Ted from 2030","Kids, you know talk show host Maury Povich. It was uncanny how often we saw this guy.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25259","Lily","Dude, everyone sees Maury Povich.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25260","Marsall","Maury Povich is everywhere. I'm sorry, Robin, but you're not a real New Yorker until you've seen Woody Allen.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25261","Robin","I am, too, a real New Yorker.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25262","Ted","That's adorable. You're from Canada.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25263","Robin","I have been here for almost six years. It's not like I just got off a boat.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25264","Lily","A boat! Oh, wait, that is how you say it.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25265","Ted","I'd say you're not a real New Yorker until you've stolen a cab from someone who needs it more than you do.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25266","Lily","No, you're not a real New Yorker till you've cried on the subway and not given a damn what anyone thinks.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25267","Marshall","No, you're not a real New Yorker until you've killed a cockroach with your bare hands.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25268","Robin","Those rules are all stupid, okay? I've never done any of those things.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25269","Ted from 2030","By the end of this day, Robin would have done all of those things.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25270","Barney","Okay, time's up. What are we talking about?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25271","Marshall","Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's, and Robin thinks that we should go see him.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25272","Barney","Why would I do that? I'll see him at poker on Tuesday.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25273","Robin","Oh, come on, if we jump in a cab, we'll be there in 15 minutes.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25274","Lily","A real New Yorker would know the subway's faster. You just take the one, and transfer to the two-three.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25275","Ted","Well, the bus runs more often on weekends. Take the M-7 to the M-5.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25276","Barney","The bus? Every time I take the bus, there is one crazy person no one wants to sit near. That's why I have never taken the bus. Plus... I can run faster than a bus.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25277","Ted","Dude, that's, like, seven miles. You can't do that. You can't beat the bus!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25278","Marshall","I can beat a bus or a cab or a train!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25279","Robin","Is anyone else suddenly craving green eggs and ham?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25280","Marshall","Machines are overrated, and someone needs to take them down a peg.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25281","Barney","You're all wrong... I got a way to get there so fast, I could beat all of you, even if I sat down and ordered a big, juicy steak first.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25282","Marshall","How?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25283","Barney","Medium rare. But that's not important right now. Look, I know the city better than any of you guys, okay?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25284","Lily","Oh, my God!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25285","Barney","Oh, wow!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25286","Ted","All right, all right, hold on, hold on! Let's just forget about it. Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway. First person there wins! (Everyone stand up et run outside)Doesn't matter how you get there!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25287","Barney","(to the sad girl at the bar) Stay sad! I'll be back!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25288","Barney","Hi. Can I see a menu, please? No rush.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25289","Ted from 2030","Kids, I should tell you, Lily really needed a win that day.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25290","Ted from 2030","When Marshall and Lily decided to have a baby, they assumed it would happen right away.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25291","Marshall","It's gonna be positive. Eriksen man are hella fertile. When Uncle Morris was 16, he got his girlfriend pregnant just by holding her hand too tight in the backseat of a car. Now I'm thinking my parents lied to me.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25292","Lily","Negative.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25293","Ted from 2030","As the weeks went by, Marshall's confidence never wavered. Then it started to mess with Lily's head.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25294","Marshall","Negative? Well, we know it's not me.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25295","Lily","Everything's fine. These things take time.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25296","Marshall","Not with an Eriksen. Something must be wrong with you. Also, my mom hates you.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25297","Lily","You know what? Just to make sure, I'm gonna pee on this again.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25298","Marshall","What? No, you wouldn't. Somebody help me! Somebody help me!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25299","Ted from 2030","Lily was so fed up with not getting anywhere, maybe winning this race was just what she needed.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25300","Man","Idiot!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25301","Marshall","I'll show them. My body can outrun any motorized vehicle. I'm like John Henry when he beat the steam engine. All I need is a great folk song.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25302","Folk singer","*Gather round, ye children to hear the tale so sweet of a man who dared to race machines with nothing but his feet*","06","04","Subway Wars"

"25307","Speaker","Maury... Maury...","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25308","Lily","Track maintenance? 20-minute delay?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25309","Man","How do you do that?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25310","Lily","I grew up here, I speak conductor. Damn it! (she gets off the train) Damn it!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25311","Ted from 2030","Kids, I also needed a win that day. A couple nights earlier, your Uncle Marshall had offhandedly mentioned a web site called...","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25312","Ted from 2030","A couple nights earlier, your Uncle Marshall had offhandedly mentioned a web site called...","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25313","Ted","Grademyteacher.net?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25314","Marshall","It's this awesome site where students can go say what they really think about their professors. Hey, you're probably on there.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25315","Ted from 2030","I just had to see what my students had written about me. And it was... Majestic. Until...","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25316","Ted from 2030","Now, kids, I knew I was a good Professor. That's why I didn't let it bother me. I had nothing to prove. Absolutely nothing.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25317","Ted","Here's a fun fact. See the Alberta Building over there?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25318","Man","Oh. The brown one or the gray one?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25319","Ted","That's the gray one. Did you know that in 18...","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25320","Barney","Hey! Come on! Elizabeth!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25321","Waiter","Somebody call an ambulance!","06","04","Subway Wars"

"25325","Woman","(jumping onto the cab)This is my cab...!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25326","Barney","Downtown hospital, please. It's right by Gregor's Steakhouse. Take the FDR, and maybe crank up some smooth jazz.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25327","Medic","Uh, we're required by law to take you to the nearest hospital, which is St. Luke's-Roosevelt. Uptown.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25328","Barney","Oh, no. (He makes a phone call) It's Barney. Help me.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25329","Ted from 2030","Robin also needed a win that day.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25330","Ted from 2030","It had been a rough year for Robin. First her boyfriend and former cohost, Don, left her for another job. Then Robin met her new cohost, Becky.","06","04","Subway Wars"

"25337","Becky","You're still the star. I made chocolate chip cookies for everybody! Yay!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25338","Ted from 2030","And just like that, Becky started to eclipse Robin. I mean, literally eclipse her.","06","04","Subway Wars"

"25345","Marshall","Hey, Christine.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25346","Folk singer","* He thought of all the times that he had beaten the machine. He triumphed over ""Pitfall"" He vanquished the alarm. He brought the jukebox back to life with his Fonzarelli arm Marshall versus the machines. *","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25347","Woman","Last seat. Thank God. I just had the worst cab ride of my life.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25348","Ted","Well, you're in luck. See that gothic church over there? Those corinthian columns were designed by Giuseppe Pegatto in 1896. (the woman stands up to find another place)","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25349","Barney","Hey, Ranjit, pull over.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25350","Ranjit","Pulling over.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25351","Barney","Hey, toots! How about a ride? Oh. Hey, Robin, it's you.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25352","Folk singer","* Hyah! Move along. Hyah! Move along. Hyah! *","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25353","Ted","See that over there? That's the old Arcadian Hotel. Fun fact... While today its neoclassical fenestration is considered to be... (the driver suddenly pulls the breaks)","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25354","Robin","So, is this ride your way of apologizing for this morning?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25355","Barney","I'm sorry. I never apologize. And why would I?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25356","Robin","Are you kidding me?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25357","Robin","Hey, Barney, can I talk to you?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25358","Barney","Sure. Stand a little more this way. I'm scouting some talent. Pretend we're talking about something important.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25359","Robin","Oh, well, this... This is something important. Um, I'm having a... A really rough time at work. You know, the whole Becky thing...","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25360","Barney","Oh, you know what? That's just getting distracting. Um, say ""carrots and peas"". Carrots and peas. Guys, I can't stop staring at that girl's face.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25361","Barney","What, you really had something to talk about?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25362","Robin","Yes. Look, I've spent the last,six years in this city, focusing on my career, all for nothing. Some lady almost got me killed. Maury Povich stole my cab. I swear, this city is starting to reject me like a bad organ transplant. You know, everyone keeps saying that I'm not a real New Yorker. Well, maybe I should just stop trying.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25363","Barney","Robin, I had no idea.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25364","Robin","No, it's my fault for thinking that you might care. Ranjit, stop the car.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25365","Ranjit","Stopping the car.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25366","Barney","No, don't stop the car.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25367","Ranjit","Not stopping the car.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25368","Robin","Seriously, stop the car.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25369","Ranjit","Seriously stopping the car.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25370","Barney","Look, you... Wait, wait... Robin, hold on. If you want to talk, I'm right here.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25371","Robin","Carrots and peas.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25372","Barney","Don't... You...","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25373","Ranjit","I'll crank up the smooth jazz.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25374","Folk singer","* Our hero's strength was fading fast just as the light turned... green. He then thought back to all the times he'd lost to a machine. The cable box is fearsome but the stapler's mighty sting... The cable box's bite again... Getting too tired to sing. *","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25375","Ted","Uses a hybrid steel tube structure...","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25376","Ted from 2030","Kids, that day, I had a horrible realization. If you can't spot the crazy person on the bus...It's you. (Ted steps out of the bus) The good news is, I was halfway there, and nothing could stop me.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25377","Marshall","Whoa! This is crazy.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25378","Robin","I can't believe it.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25379","Ted","Okay, this is clearly a sign. Let's just call it a tie. Forget about the race. Head back to the bar.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25380","Ted from 2030","Just like that, the race was back on.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25381","Maury Povich","Idiot.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25382","Ted from 2030","Meanwhile, one subway car over...","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25383","Robin","Oh, God. Oh, bite me!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25384","Barney","Faster. Mush! Mush! I need this win. I need this win.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25385","Barney","And firing half my department freed up the money to double my own salary. And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25386","Ted from 2030","Actually, Barney did not need a win.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25387","Barney","And I smell incredible. Smell me. Just, seriously, smell me.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25388","Ted from 2030","He did smell incredible.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25389","Barney","Stop! Too slow. Switch.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25390","Lily","Sweetie? Are you okay?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25391","Robin","No. I am done with this city. It wins. I just want to move somewhere new and start over.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25392","Lily","You've had a rough year. But you're tough. And I love you like crazy. If you left, I'd have to follow you. And Marshall would follow me. And Ted would follow him. The only upside is that we might get rid of Barney. Bring it in.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25393","Robin","What did he say?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25394","Lily","No clue. Hey, is that Maury Povich?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25395","Robin","Hey! Lily.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25396","Lily","Sorry, sweetie. I swear I'll be a great friend at the finish line, but the conductor just said you're going express to Borough Hall, which means you're screwed, sweetie. So long, sucker. (the doors of the train opens) Damn it. (she makes a phone call) Hey, it's Lily. Help me.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25397","Ted","And not a single passenger would listen to me. I mean, am I a bad teacher? Do I just put people to sleep?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25398","Man, in a calculator display","Buddy? Hey, buddy? Need a hand?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25399","Marshall","The machines have won! he machines have won.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25400","Man","Dude, mellow.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25401","Marshall","I can't do it. I can't run that far. I can't outrace anything. I... I can't... I can't get my wife pregnant!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25402","Ted","Wait. Is that what this whole stupid running thing has been about?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25403","Marshall","My body has been letting me down, and I just wanted to prove that it could still do something, but it can't.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25404","Ted","Dude, you've been trying for two months, not two years. That's nothing.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25405","Marshall","Well, you should talk. You know, you're the one who's freaking out because you have one mediocre review and, like, 50 great ones.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25406","Ted","64. But whatever.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25407","Marshall","And you're designing a frickin' building. I mean, come on, dude.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25408","Man","Sounds like you guys need to clear everything, subtract the negativity, and add some perspective.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25409","Lily","Marshall! Marshall, get in!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25410","Ranjit","Hello.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25411","Ted","There it is.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25412","Robin","Where are Marshall and lily?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25413","Barney","Who cares?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25414","Robin","I won? I won!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25415","Barney","No!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25416","Robin","I can't believe I won!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25417","Barney","How did that even happen?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25418","Ted from 2030","Here's how it happened.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25419","Lily","Okay, he's in. Go. Go. Gun it.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25420","Ranjit","Ted is in the way.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25421","Lily","Run him over.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25422","Ranjit","Running him over.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25423","Marshall","No. Lily, what the hell is the matter with you?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25424","Lily","Nothing. I just want to win this really badly. So badly that I just ditched my best friend when she needed me.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25425","Marshall","Oh, baby, you were also going to run over Ted.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25426","Lily","Why did I get so crazy about this?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25427","Marshall","Maybe for the same reason that I kept saying that I could run seven miles. I... I'm trying to be really, um, confident and positive about all this, but, baby, I'm really scared that we're not pregnant yet.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25428","Lily","Oh, thank God. I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25429","Marshall","I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25430","Lily","It's only been two months.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25431","Marshall","We are crazy.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25432","Lily","We're totally crazy.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25433","Marshall","This is the last time it's ever going to be just the two of us. Shouldn't we be enjoying that?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25434","Lily","We gotta go back to Paris.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25435","Marshall","And take ballroom dancing.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25436","Lily","And really learn how to ski. Not just up and get faced in the lodge.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25437","Marshall","And see Coney Island. I've still never been. See, we have a whole bucket list of things to do before we start having kids.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25438","Lily","Oh, a cradle list.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25439","Marshall","I'm... So glad we're trying, and I'm going to be really excited for when it happens, but this isn't a race.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25440","Lily","It isn't a race.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25441","Marshall","Ranjit, screw Gregor's. Let's go to Coney Island.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25442","Ranjit","Screwing Gregor's. Going to Coney Island.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25443","Ted from 2030","As for how Robin beat me and Barney, to this day, your uncle Barney won't admit it... Who cares? But here's what I saw  I saw Barney notice Robin's face... And maybe realize something. Barney says he tripped, but it sure felt like he tackled me on purpose. And when Robin won, I could have sworn I saw him smile.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25444","Robin","I won!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25445","Barney","No!","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25446","Robin","So I said, ""the cab, of course""","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25447","Ted","I know what you did back there.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25448","Barney","Yeah. Check it. I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks, and I still smell incredible. Smell me.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25449","Ted","I'm not gonna... Not gonna...","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25450","Barney","Smell me.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25451","Ted from 2030","He did smell incredible.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25452","Robin","Wait a minute. So, where is Woody Allen?","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25453","Max","He's right there.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25454","Robin","Damn it, Max. That's Maury Povich.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25455","Max","I always get those two confused.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25456","Ted from 2030","Technically, there was only one winner that day. And in that race, everyone found exactly what they needed. It's true, she wouldn't see Woody Allen for another couple months, but that's how Robin became, by just about any definition of the term... A real New Yorker.","06","04","Subway Wars"
"25457","Ted from 2030","Kids, in the fall of 2010, I was designing the new headquarters for Goliath National Bank, which meant working side by side with your Uncle Barney.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25458","Ted","I love your idea about a giant rooftop ring of fire you can jump through with a motorcycle, but I tweaked it slightly and... This is still super bad-ass. It's now a patio garden where you can bring a nice bag lunch.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25459","Barney","Sick. Yeah. Dude. Working together is gonna be legen... Wait for it. I'll send you an inter-office memo with the rest 'cause we freakin' work together!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25460","Ted from 2030","Everything was going great. That is, right up until Barney said...","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25461","Barney","Oh, big news. The board finally settled on a site for the building.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25462","Ted from 2030","It was the site of The Arcadian, one of New York's grandest old hotels. In its heyday, it was the New York home to kings and queens. But lately... mostly just queens.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25463","Transvestite","Hi, handsome. Lookin' for a date?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25464","Ted","Uh, no, thank you. Still got it.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25465","Ted","Barney, we have to talk.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25466","Barney","Sure. What's up?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25467","Barney's Secretary","Excuse me, Mr. Stinson.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25468","Barney","Not now, Trish!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25469","Barney's Secretary","But there's an urgent memo for Mr. Mosby.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25470","Ted","""Dary.""","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25471","Barney","Legendary! So, what's on your mind?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25472","Ted","I can't design the building.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25473","Marshall","Oh, yeah.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25474","Lily","Oh, baby. No, no. Not the slipper socks with the rubber soles. I work so hard to-to set the mood, and-and when I see those, I feel the egg go right back up my Fallopian tube.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25475","Marshall","Baby, these satin sheets are slippery. Papa needs traction.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25476","Lily","Traction?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25477","Marshall","As you know, Papa likes to get down with enthusiasm.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25478","Lily","Please stop calling yourself ""Papa.""","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25479","Marshall","And without traction, Papa's likely to boogie himself right out of bed. It's either these or soccer cleats.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25480","Lily","Hey, so I talked to Robin. I guess she and Max hooked up last night.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25481","Ted from 2030","Kids, as you may remember, Max was a friend of Marshall's from law school... with whom Robin was really starting to hit it off.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25482","Marshall","Nice! I love that guy. Max is both his name and his level of awesomeness.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25483","Lily","Yeah. He's a sweet guy. She feels really comfortable with him. They bonded over hockey. I guess he has a small pen1s, but they want to double-date next weekend.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25484","Marshall","Why would you tell me that?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25485","Lily","So you'll clear your schedule.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25486","Marshall","No! The other part!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25487","Lily","Oh, the small pen1s thing?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25488","Marshall","Ah! Don't! Stop saying that! Why do you keep saying that? You... I don't want to know that. I'm not going to be able to look the guy in the eye. I'm certainly not going to be able to call him ""Max.""","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25489","Lily","That's insane. I mean, just because you know Max has a small pen1s...","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25490","Marshall","Just don't!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25491","Barney","You're kidding me.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25492","Ted","I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25493","Barney","Snakes.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25494","Ted","Did you just say ""snakes""?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25495","Barney","I don't recall saying ""snakes"". Ted, I know you love crappy old stuff no one cares about. But I'm gonna give you four words to live by  New is always better.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25496","Ted","New is always better?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25497","Barney","You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25498","Ted","Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25499","Barney","Everything.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25500","Ted","So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25501","Barney","Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25502","Ted","And when you're at a Guns n' Roses concert, you're like, ""Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy""?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25503","Barney","Axl's really matured as a songwriter, Ted.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25504","Ted","Wendy! I'd like to buy my friend a drink. What's your oldest Scotch?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25505","Wendy","Glenmckenna, aged 30 years in oak casks.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25506","Ted","Amazing. And what's your newest scotch?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25507","Wendy","Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch. Don't let it touch your skin.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25508","Ted","Your call, buddy.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25509","Barney","A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch sounds lovely. Lots of ice. New is always better, Ted! That's a rule. Just like bigger is always better!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25510","Marshall","Pff. That's not true. Uh, sometimes smaller is better. ""Hey, look how big my cell phone is!"" You don't hear people say that. No. You want something compact and efficient that fits comfortably in your pocket, and I think Max is just a great guy.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25511","Robin","Lily told you.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25512","Ted","Told him what?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25513","Lily","Max has a small pen1s.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25514","Barney","How can you speak of such things?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25515","Robin","Girls talk about everything.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25516","Lily","Size, shape, left or right leaning orientation...","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25517","Robin","Length, resemblance to a historical figure, such as Winston Churchill... Yes, that's one of you. Girth, grooming...","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25518","Barney","How can you speak of such things?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25519","Lily","You're kidding. Barney, every time I mention a woman you don't know, the first thing you say is, ""Boobs?"" Not the complete sentence, ""Does she have big boobs?"" Which also would not be great. Just  ""Boobs?""","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25520","Barney","I do not do that.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25521","Lily","My friend Lori from work...","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25522","Barney","Boobs? Damn it. But... seriously. Boobs?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25523","Lily","So why is it okay for guys to talk about boobs, but the moment we bring up a topic like Max's small pen1s... I'm gonna pretend this conversation never happened.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25524","Marshall","Impossible. Max's pen1s is stuck in my brain like a splinter. Like a splinter-sized splinter.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25525","Barney","Speaking of disappointing weenies... Ted, tell them what you told me.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25526","Ted","I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25527","Barney","I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin... Wait a minute. Who's the girl?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25528","Robin","Duh. Of course there's a girl.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25529","Ted","What? I... There's no g-girl. Why would you even... Her name is Zoey.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25530","Barney","Boobs?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25531","Woman","Beautiful building, right?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25532","Ted","Look, mister, you are very convincing, and I am very flattered. Confused, even. But I'm not looking...","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25533","Woman","I'm not a drag queen. But you definitely have me rethinking this eye shadow.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25534","Ted","Not only is she funny, hot and genetically female, but get this...","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25535","Woman","Look at the Palladian windows, the rusticated stonework, the marble cornices...","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25536","Ted","She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25537","Barney","Whose dream?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25538","Ted","We wound up talking for hours.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25539","Woman","I love how old parts of the city are. Hmm. It makes me feel connected to history.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25540","Ted","Old is always better. I can't wait to be old.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25541","Woman","Me, too. You can wear elastic everything. Your lipstick doesn't have to stay inside the lines.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25542","Ted","You can shoplift and pretend you're just confused.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25543","Woman","You could nap anywhere. Uh-huh. Even while driving. It's gonna be great. I can't wait to be all run-down and weathered and wrinkly.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25544","Ted","Well, I'd say you got a pretty long wait.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25545","Woman","That's sweet. It would be sweeter if you hadn't thought I was a tranny before, but it's still sweet.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25546","Barney","Oh, Ted, that's so romantic. I want to fill a pillowcase with dead batteries and beat you with it.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25547","Woman","Hey, Ted, can I ask you something","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25548","Ted","Anything.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25549","Woman","Will you sign this petition? Save The Arcadian"" We are gonna stop the bastards at Goliath National Bank from demolishing it. Will you support us?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25550","Barney","And you said...?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25551","Ted","Where do I sign?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25552","Barney","Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25553","Ted","This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25554","Barney","And what did this ""Zoey"" say when she found out that you're the one tearing down her beloved Arcadian? That you, Ted Mosby, are the Architect Of Destruction?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25555","Marshall","Whoa! Sweet wrestling name alert.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25556","Ted","Well... Uh, it's a... it's a funny thing about that...","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25557","Zoey","So what do you do, Ted?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25558","Ted","I'm a veterinarian.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25559","Ted","What? I panicked!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25560","Barney","This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25561","Ted","I don't do that.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25562","Ted","Well, off to meet Steph. We're adrenaline junkies! [...]Penelope is taking me to the Battle of Gettysburg. We're gonna eat squirrel! [...] (Ted enters the living room, dressed up as a wizard) Look, she's really hot, okay?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25563","Ted","Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25564","Barney","Asian girls love them some Jews.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25565","Ted","And Marshall never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25566","Lily","Um, I think you got that backwards there, Chief.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25567","Marshall","And you're welcome.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25568","Ted","The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25569","Barney","No. Technically, they were eggs.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25570","Ted","Did you just say ""eggs""?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25571","Barney","I don't recall saying ""eggs.""","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25572","Max","So I walk into my boss's office and suddenly I realize, ""Holy crap, I'm about to quit""""","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25573","Marshall, thinking","Small pen1s. You have a small pen1s. Oh, that's super interesting, but you have a small pen1s. Damn it, Marshall! Okay. Okay. Think of any two words other than ""small"" or ""pen1s"". Got it  small pen1s. Damn it!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25574","Robin","Yeah, I-I think it is so cool that you started your own law firm.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25575","Max","Well, right now it's a pretty small practice.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25576","Marshall","Hey, hey. I bet it's not that small.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25577","Max","Bro, it's... pretty small.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25578","Marshall","Yeah, but, uh, you know what they say. The important thing is-is how you use it, you know? ""The motion of the ocean."" That whole thing.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25579","Robin","He said it's small, Marshall, and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25580","Marshall","I'm just saying that I bet it's bigger than he thinks. And thick.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25581","Max","Nah. Everything about it is tiny. The office is tiny. The conference room is tiny. Plus, I got a very small staff.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25582","Robin","Let's order!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25583","Ted from 2030","As I was mustering the courage to call Zoey and tell her my true identity...","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25584","Ted","Zoey... I'm Batman. Hmm. That'd be cool.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25585","Ted from 2030","...the strangest thing happened.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25586","Zoey","I need your help. (They go outside. Zoey opens the back doors of a truck) Just to warn you. What I'm about to show you is not a hundred percent legal.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25587","Ted","Wasn't expecting bunnies.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25588","Zoey","I stole them, Ted. My animal rights group liberated these guys from an evil cosmetics company. And I figured, ""Hey, Ted's a vet. He can check them out and make sure they're okay.""","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25589","Ted","Absolutely. Just let me run up and get my bag of vet supplies. Okay. Why would I say that?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25590","Max","Well, I know what I'm getting.Oh? Oh?The porterhouse. I've had it here before. It is like this. It's huge.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25591","Marshall","Well, spare no expense, buddy. Dinner is on me, and-and get dessert. Maybe this molten chocolate lava cake? I just want you to be happy.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25592","Max","Thanks, man. Next time, it is on me. Aw. Excuse me. I'll be right back. All right.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25593","Robin","Totally.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25594","Marshall","We'll just be here. (He gives a hug to Max)You're great.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25595","Max","Ah. Thanks, bro. It's, uh.... it's going on a while.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25596","Marshall","I know.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25597","Max","Thanks.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25598","Lily","Damn, baby, be cool!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25599","Robin","You're acting like he has six months to live.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25600","Marshall","It's your fault! You ladies and your salty sailor talk!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25601","Robin","Oh, come on! What about you men and your locker room talk?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25602","Marshall","Locker room talk. Do you want to know what it's like in a men's locker room?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25603","Marshall","It's just a bunch of uncomfortable dudes trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. And one old guy just letting it all hang out.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25604","Lily","Are you suggesting that guys don't talk about s*x?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25605","Marshall","Yes, we do, but you know what we say? ""I hit that.""""I got some.""""I tapped it."" ""I squeezed those."" Discreet and efficient.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25606","Robin","Not to mention classy.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25607","Marshall","Thank God that I'm not dating. If I thought that Lily talked in that much detail about our s*x life, I'd probably kill myself. Oh, no. What did you tell her?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25608","Lily","Oh, nothing. We don't talk about you!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25609","Marshall","Are you sure?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25610","Robin","Yeah. That argument has no traction whatsoever.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25611","Ted","You just broke in and stole these guys? Aren't you worried about getting arrested?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25612","Zoey","Nah. I've been arrested lots of times. Chinese Democracy.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25613","Ted","Wow. You're a little bit crazy.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25614","Zoey","Well, I'm usually crazy for a good cause. I can't just sit by while voiceless people or animals, r even buildings et screwed over. 'm certainly not going o just sit by hile GNB turns The Arcadian nto a soulless metal box.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25615","Ted","Yeah. Yeah. Although I hear there's a lovely rooftop patio where folks can enjoy a nice bag lunch, so...","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25616","Zoey","Ted, I will find the bastards at GNB responsible for this, and I promise you, I will take them down.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25617","Barney","Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25618","Ted","Solid C-cup, perky bounce.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25619","Barney","Momentary grudging respect.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25620","Ted","Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25621","Barney","Ted, that is never gonna happen.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25622","Ted","Well, I can't tear down The Arcadian. I'm sorry, but I'm off the project.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25623","Zoey","Hey, guys! I appreciate the great turnout, but just so we're all on the same page, this is not a rally to legalize marijuana.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25624","Man","Oh, bummer!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25625","Ted","Hey.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25626","Zoey","Hey, Ted. I'm so glad you came.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25627","Ted","Well, you really got to me the other night. I want to get involved with ""Save The Arcadian.""","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25628","Zoey","Great. I'll grab you a picket sign. Hmm. Do you want ""GNB puts the douche in fiduciary..""...or ""It's always 4 20 somewhere""? Dudes, you forgot your signs!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25629","Ted from 2030","As I looked up at that magnificent old structure, I realized I wasn't letting my feelings for Zoey mislead me. This building really was worth saving.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25630","Zoey","Ted, everything okay? Yea... um... um... You work for GNB?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25631","Man","Dude, why are you dressed like a wizard?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25632","Ted","She was really hot, okay?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25633","Ted","How the hell could you do that?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25634","Barney","Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25635","Ted","The billboard, Barney.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25636","Barney","I had to. Now that you have no shot with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25637","Ted","You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25638","Barney","Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25639","Ted","Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25640","Barney","Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25641","Ted","You named the rabbit?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25642","Barney","You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her. The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building. Dude, you can do whatever you want with it.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25643","Ted","You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25644","Barney","So you're back in?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25645","Ted","Yeah.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25646","Ted from 2030","That night, as I worked on a new design that just might solve all my problems... Marshall was visited by a disturbing vision.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25647","Lily","Ugh, he thinks I like this...But it feels disgusting.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25648","Robin","Uh, it looks disgusting.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25649","Marshall","Uh, is this working for you?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25650","Lily","""Uh, is this working for you?""","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25651","Robin","Oh, of course, because what woman doesn't like being slobbered on while some giant paws at her nether regions like Lenny from Of Mice and Men?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25652","Lily","Oh, you're bad.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25653","Robin","More Cosmos?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25654","Marshall","I can't... I can't do this! I can't stop thinking about you and Robin!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25655","Lily","Oh, I've had that a couple times. Just lean into it and let it fuel things.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25656","Marshall","Look, no. You know what? Why don't you just... Why don't you just call Robin, okay, and have a good laugh about it? Whoa! Traction could have prevented that.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25657","Zoey","Well, hope you don't mind, we made some changes to the billboard.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25658","Ted","Well, that explains a few voicemails. Listen, Zoey, I think we can save The Arcadian. No. Maybe not in the way you were picturing, but I stayed up all night working on a new concept, all right? What if my design could incorporate The Arcadian's facade into the new GNB headquarters?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25659","Ted from 2030","Kids, it was one of those moments in life where everything comes together... the girl, the building, everything, until...","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25660","Ted","Are you married?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25661","Zoey","Yeah. So you were saying, the facade will be completely preserved?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25662","Ted","This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25663","Ted","Yeah, it was about the girl.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25664","Zoey","Ted, wh-wh-what are you doing?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25665","Ted","This wouldn't work. Zoey, The Arcadian was a really great building once, but it's falling apart, and it's full of snakes.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25666","Zoey","Snakes?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25667","Ted","I don't recall saying snakes.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25668","Lily","Then he gets this panicked look on his face, says, ""I can't do this,"" and storms out.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25669","Robin","Wow, that is weird.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25670","Lily","But here's the crazier part.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25671","Marshall","No. You know what? Papa don't back down from a fight. So why don't you tell Robin... about this!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25672","Lily","It was amazing. He was passionate, animalistic, a complete stud.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25673","Robin","Wow. So he's right there making you say all this, huh?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25674","Lily","Yup. ""'You're like a Greek god, I moaned, as the..."" I can't read that, baby.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25675","Marshall","""Musky scent of man.""","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25676","Lily","""As the musky scent of man and Marshall's sure-footed traction intoxicated and overpowered me.""","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25677","Robin","That sounds real.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25678","Ted from 2030","And as for Zoey, it was funny. I'd lied to her, then completely let her down. And I barely knew the girl. But there was something about her. I couldn't help but wonder if I'd ever see her again.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25679","Zoey","Hey, Mosby! You're gonna have to come out of your hole at some point, you son of a bitch! Yeah! Legalize it! Dude! Ready. Aim. Fire!","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25680","Ted from 2030","Why, yes. Yes, I would see her again.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25681","Marshall","How's it going with Robin?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25682","Max","Uh, I think I have to break up with her.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25683","Marshall","Really? Why? You with her?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25684","Max","Yeah, well, there's this... kind of weird thing she likes to do in the bedroom.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25685","Ted","Hey, what's not for everyone?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25686","Marshall","Guys, come on. What is it?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25687","Max","Come on, bro. This is a locker room.","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25688","Marshall","I... What do you think it was, Murray?","06","05","Architect of Destruction"
"25689","Ted from 2030","Kids, in the fall of 2010, our friends Stuart and Claudia had a baby, and Marshall and Lily were the first to visit the happy new parents.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25690","Marshall","So, have you guys landed on a name yet?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25691","Stuart","We're trying, but it's tougher than you think. You see, I like ""Tiffany.""","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25692","Claudia","And I don't want my daughter to have a whore's name.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25693","Stuart","That's my mother's name.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25694","Claudia","I know.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25695","Stuart","Oh, I got it. How 'bout we name the baby after you-- ""Frigid Shrew.""","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25696","Claudia","Oh, that's good. No, no, no, no. Let's call her ""Vodka."" Then at least we know you'd hold her tight and never let her go!","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25697","Stuart","Don't knock the vodka. Wouldn't have a kid without it.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25698","Marshall","Stuart, you are so... That's not gonna be us, right? I mean, how hard can it be to name a baby?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25699","Lily","Right? I mean, just look at her. Yeah. She's clearly a...","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25700","Marshall","Emily.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25701","Lily","Lisa.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25702","Marshall","Lisa?!","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25703","Lily","Emily?!","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25704","Marshall","Okay! I made a list of awesome baby names. Starting at the top  number one...","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25705","Ted","I'm gonna stop you right here, Marshall. You name a chubby white kid ""LeBron,"" and he's the one getting stuffed in the basketball hoop.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25706","Marshall","Then I'm also crossing off, um, ""Shaquille""... Mm-hmm. ""Hakeem,"" and ""Dikembe."" Hey, what about ""Rob""?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25707","Lily","""Rob""? No.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25708","Marshall","Why not?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25709","Lily","Hey, Rob. What are you gonna make? A turkey?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25710","Rob","Honka, honka!","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25711","Lily","Not ""Rob.""","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25712","Marshall","um, how about ""Ryan""?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25713","Ted","Ooh.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25714","Lily","Not ""Ryan.""","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25715","Marshall","""Johnny?""","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25716","Lily","Hey, where's the goldfish?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25717","Lily","Not ""Johnny."" Or ""Gil.""","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25718","Marshall","""Jeremy.""","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25719","Lily","Jeremy, no!","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25720","Lily","Definitely not ""Jeremy."" His stuff was so derivative.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25721","Marshall","Well, I mean, geez, Lily.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25722","Robin","Well, whatever you do, do not name your baby ""Becky,"" right?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25723","Marshall","Why? What?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25724","Robin","Becky. My new co-anchor? Don't you guys ever watch the show?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25725","Lily","Oh, honey, I really try.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25726","Marshall","Our DVR won't recognize it as a television program.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25727","Ted","I watched. Robin insisted I confirm how ""awful"" Becky is, so last night I checked it out.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25728","Robin","Peace talks in the region have been described as, ""productive."" Becky?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25729","Becky","(in baby voice)  Last night, in Staten Island, a taco cart owner was robbed at gunpoint. Aww... That's so sad.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25730","Robin","Becky, we're-we're journalists. We can't get emotional about the news, we...","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25731","Becky","Oh, no! They stole all his money and then pelted him with his own taco meat! Who would do that?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25732","Robin","Well, if you read the story, we might find out.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25733","Becky","Oh, can I do this one, about the horse? I love horseys. Mm-hmm. Aww, the horse died. Guys! This news is all really sad.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25734","Robin","Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25735","Ted","Mmm... (muttering) I thought she was charming.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25736","Robin","You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25737","Barney","You want the long version or the short version?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25738","Lily","Short version.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25739","Barney","Short version. Who's your daddy?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25740","Lily","You know, when you think about that, that phrase is really creepy.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25741","Marshall","No, it's not. It's fun. Here, watch this. Hey, Lily... Who's your daddy?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25742","Robin","Okay, uh, let me get this straight. So, in, uh, in this scenario, because you make such sweet love to Lily, she is now your daughter.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25743","Marshall","No, she is not my daughter. I'm just her daddy.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25744","Ted","Wow. That is disgusting.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25745","Robin","Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25746","Barney","Challenge accepted.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25747","Robin","No.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25748","Barney","I, Barney Stinson, will pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25749","Lily","Okay. Here's my list of baby names.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25750","Marshall","Oh.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25751","Lily","What about ""Tara""?","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25752","Marshall","No. Not ""Tara."" Tara was the hottest girl in my high school. We were all, like, obsessed with her.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25753","Marshall","We didn't just talk about her and fantasize about her... We wrote songs about her.","06","06","Baby Talk"
"25754","Marshall and his friends, singing","* Tara, your booty is so smooth; And I hope this isn't rude; But I want to get up on it. *","06","06","Baby Talk"

"25960","GNB announcer","What makes Goliath National Bank different from other big banks? Here at GNB, we care.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25961","Barney","I care about our precious Earth.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25962","Randy","I care about old people.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25963","Man","I care about high-yield offshore investments. And so does Tugboat here. Isn't that right, Tugboat?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25964","Marshall","Yeah. Okay, get that camera out of my face before I flip you like a cheese omelet.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25965","Barney","All you have to do is say ""I care about making dreams come true.""","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25966","Marshall","First of all, that line makes me sound like a hooker and saying it makes me feel like a hooker, so.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25967","Barney","Everyone is in this video. Randy's in the video.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25968","Randy","I don't want to brag, but in 29 takes, I only threw up thrice.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25969","Marshall","Wait. Randy, did you send the Hermanson contracts downtown?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25970","Randy","I did. I sent them downtown. Why are you saying it like that?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25971","Marshall","They never arrived at the downtown office.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25972","Randy","They... Well, just to make sure we're on the same page is ""send them downtown"" not an expression for shredding a document?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25973","Marshall","You shredded them?!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25974","Randy","Yeah. I sent them downtown. You know, down into the shredder. You-you feed the paper in a downwards fashion, so that's where the expression comes from.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25975","Marshall","That's not an expression! That has never been an expression!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25976","Randy","Okay, I can fix this. I am all over this project.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25977","Barney","I'll say this  There is no quit in that guy. You should fire him.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25978","Marshall","Okay, that, that right there. That attitude is exactly why I won't be in your video. Because GNB doesn't care. They hand out pink slips like they're hors d'oevres. Just last week, I was talking to Arthur...","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25979","Arthur","Oh, whoa, you're wearing a green tie now. I'm wearing a green tie.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25980","Marshall","GNB treats people like they're disposable, and I will not be a part of that. Marshall Eriksen does not fire people, period.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25981","Randy","Uh, just want you to know, we are making good progress on this new project. (phone rings) Oh, you gentlemen keep talking, I will answer that. Marshall Eriksen's office. [...] Yeah, I can get that for you. [...] Just a second. Uh... bank. The ""B"" stands for bank. Okay, Mother, I'll see you tonight. Oh, yikes. I'd better get Mr. Messy a napkin. (loud clattering)","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25982","Marshall","Period.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25983","Lily","Just tell me who you slept with!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25984","Robin","Lily, I don't want to get into it, okay?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25985","Lily","Aha, it's someone we know. If it was some ding dong we didn't know, you'd just give me his name.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25986","Robin","Fine. It's Bill Pepper.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25987","Lily","Bill Pepper? Mm-hmm. Kind of a coincidence there happens to be a bill and a pepper shaker here on the table. Any chance you and Bill had a three-way with Fork Napkin? It's someone we know!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25988","Ted","So, I'm assuming you all read the chapters on the Greek Revival architecture. Any questions?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25989","Zoey","Yes. How do you sleep at night?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25990","Ted","What are you doing here?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25991","Zoey","It was recently made clear to me that I don't know the first thing about architecture, so here I am.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25992","Ted","Very well, then, let's get started. (clears throat) Some examples of Greek Revival architecture...","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25993","Zoey","Ooh! Ooh! Is The Arcadian Greek Revival?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25994","Ted","No.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25995","Student","What's The Arcadian?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25996","Zoey","Oh, it's just this beautiful, old building that Professor Mosby wants to tear down.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25997","Student","What?! No, Professor Mosby loves old buildings. He wouldn't do that. Right, Ted?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25998","Ted","Getting back to Greek Revival...","06","07","Canning Randy"
"25999","Ted","I lost them.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26000","Lily","Look, you're new at teaching. In my kindergarten class, I have had plenty of troublesome students. Like Johnny Marley...","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26001","Lily","Johnny? Johnny!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26002","Lily","He and that little stuffed horsey raised all kinds of hell. But I have a simple method for shutting down troublemakers. You know that '98 Taurus that's always parked outside? The one with the really annoying alarm?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26003","Ted","We're familiar with it.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26004","Lily","Well, when a kid like Johnny acts up in my class...","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26005","Lily","Shuts them right up.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26006","Ted","Lily, my students are adults, and I treat them that way. I'll just give them more candy and make them a mix CD. Problem solved.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26007","Lily","Oh, baby, what's wrong?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26008","Marshall","Something bad happened.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26009","Marshall","Randy, hey, have you seen the...","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26010","Randy","Before you get to that, regarding the earlier project I was working on... Voil&agrave;!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26011","Marshall","That's the Hermanson contract?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26012","Randy","The Hermanson contract? Oh, man, this is the Filbert contract. Damn it! No... (He shredds the file once again) Anyway, what's your thing?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26013","Marshall","I need the Filbert contract!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26014","Randy","Well, I'll do what I can. But in my experience, twice shredded is fairly permanent.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26015","Marshall","Sorry, Randy, but... this just isn't working out.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26016","Barney","Marshall popped his cherry! Oh! Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster. I mean, it reflected badly on the company. He was an embarrassment. A huge embarrassment.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26017","Lily","You slept with Randy!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26018","Robin","What?!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26019","Lily","Why, it's elementary, my dear Scherbatson.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26020","Lily","Your co-host is getting super-popular because of her stupid commercial, ""Boats! Boats! Boats!"" So, when you arrived at the GNB party after we left, you were feeling vulnerable and drunk. Then, from across the not-so-crowded conference room, your eyes met. And as we all remember... Randy has a unique condition.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26021","Robin","Yeah, your nose is bleeding like a faucet.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26022","Randy","Oh, God, this happens every time I get an erection. I am so sorry.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26023","Robin","That's...exactly what happened.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26024","Barney","See, Marshall, if getting fired is an execution, at least the guy had a last meal. I promise you, tomorrow you'll feel a lot better.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26025","Marshall","Randy, hey, what's going on?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26026","Randy","I just wanted to say no hard feelings.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26027","Marshall","Thank you. So where you headed now?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26028","Randy","Downtown. (Randy jumps into the shredder, Marshall wakes up)","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26029","Marshall","No!!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26030","Lily","It's okay, baby.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26031","Ted from 2030","It wasn't okay. So the next morning...","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26032","Marshall","Arthur, I'm here because I made a mistake. I fired Randy yesterday.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26033","Arthur","That was a mistake. You should have fired him a year ago.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26034","Marshall","No, sir, that is what's wrong with this company. How can we say ""GNB Cares,"" and then turn around and treat someone like that? I mean, sure, he made a few mistakes but everybody makes mistakes. Like, like Tugboat here. Aw. I bet you he's made some mistakes. And you didn't fire Tugboat, did you?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26035","Arthur","No, I got him fixed, and he calmed down.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26036","Marshall","Exactly-- kind of. Randy doesn't need to be fired. He needs to be fixed.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26037","Arthur","Marshall, we do some pretty bad things around here, but I...","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26038","Marshall","No, sir, I'm saying instead of getting rid of someone when they screw up, we should... we should help them. We should nurture them.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26039","Arthur","I changed the ice pack on his crotch every hour for three days. Wow, Eriksen, if you want to un-fire Randy, I support you, because to come in here and say what you just said, well, you've got a couple things that Tugboat doesn't.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26040","Ted","Guys, Prof Rock is a really good mix, okay?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26041","Student","A piece of New York history is being torn down, and all you could say was ""Boo freakin' hoo""?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26042","Ted","Boo... freakin'...","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26043","Zoey","I may have mentioned our conversation over a session of hacky sack.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26044","Ted","The one day I miss the sack circle, you guys sub her in?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26045","Zoey","Why'd you miss? Too busy tearing down the Statue of Liberty?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26046","Ted","No. I was returning a hot dog costume that you all enjoyed.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26047","Ted from 2030","They were all turning against me, so I figured, what the hell.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26048","Lily","And did it work?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26049","Ted","Like gangbusters. We're buddies again. After class, we hacked a little sack to the thumpin' strains of my Prof Rock CD. And no, none of them had heard the Pixies B-side. Actually, none of them had heard of the Pixies. Or a B-side.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26050","Randy","Hey, guys.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26051","Barney","Uh-oh. I know that smile. Lily, there's no easy way to say this. Marshall's dead. Randy murdered him.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26052","Lily","No. I know why Randy is smiling. You're smiling because of Robin.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26053","Randy","Robin? Like how I think about her when I'm in the shower?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26054","Ted","I'm trying to eat here, buddy.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26055","Lily","No. Because you slept with her on Halloween.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26056","Randy","What? No. I went home, had a shower an-and went to bed.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26057","Lily","You didn't sleep with her?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26058","Randy","No. Even in the shower, the farthest we ever get is hugging.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26059","Lily","So why are you smiling?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26060","Randy","I'll tell you why.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26061","Marshall","This just isn't working out.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26062","Randy, thinking","I'm fired. Great. This is the candle kiosk at the mall all over again. Wait a minute. I can get a severance check. If I don't shred it, I can use that money to start my own brewery. Imagine a beer with my name on it. Randy Wharmpiss, this is the best day of your life.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26063","Randy","Thanks to that severance check, this time next year, you'll all be enjoying a frothy mug of Wharmpiss.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26064","Marshall","Randy, great news! You're not fired!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26065","Randy, wailing","No...!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26066","Ted","Good morning, everybody... Where's my class?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26067","Zoey","Hello, Professor. Ha-boom.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26068","Marshall","I got you your job back, Randy. I thought that you'd be happy.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26069","Randy","But I don't belong here. I'm born to be a brewer! A... a hopsmeister!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26070","Marshall","Well, then quit. No one's stopping you.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26071","Randy","I-I can't. I need my severance check.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26072","Marshall","Well, I'm sorry Randy, but that's called fraud.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26073","Randy","It's not fraud. I'm just asking you to get me a lot of money to not work here and not tell anyone about it.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26074","Marshall","Even if I wanted to fire you, after my talk with Arthur...","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26075","Randy","Oh, come on, Arthur can't remember that.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26076","Arthur, entering the room","Marshall, what a memorable talk we had yesterday. Randy, on behalf of everyone at GNB, both in and out of prison, we're sorry. And I want to assure you you will never be fired again. You're going to work here until you die, huh? Green tie? (clears throat) Nice choice.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26077","Randy","Thanks. It brings out my eyes.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26078","Arthur","Yeah. I'll bring out your eyes.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26079","Marshall","Listen, Randy, I'm sorry, but I broke my own moral code once and I felt evil. I will not let GNB change me. I will never fire anyone again ever.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26080","Randy","Oh, we'll see about that.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26081","Barney","Anyhoo, while I got you-- big smile. ""We care about making dreams come true,"" in three, two...","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26082","Randy","No!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26083","Marshall","What are you doing?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26084","Randy","Oh, are you unhappy with my performance? Well, I guess I'm fired, then. I'd better turn in my I.D.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26085","Marshall","No, it's actually, um, nice having some of this clutter off my desk. So thank you, Randy.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26086","Randy","And there's more.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26087","Marshall","I don't know what I'm going to use this for, but it's great stuff.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26088","Randy","Now am I fired?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26089","Marshall","I've been meaning to clean out that file cabinet for ages.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26090","Barney","I'm not even here. Randy, the coffee.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26091","Marshall","Oh! Okay. Okay. Thank you, Randy. I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26092","Barney","Here, try this, but really go for it. Remember, this guy ruined your life.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26093","Marshall","That's just the pick-me-up I needed.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26094","Barney","Speaking of pickups, can we try the first one again?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26095","Lily","Hello.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26096","Ted","It didn't work. They hate me. How do I get them to like me again?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26097","Lily","You don't. Ted, you're their teacher. The only people that like their teachers...","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26098","Ted","I like my teachers.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26099","Lily","...are dorks. Except for you, Miles. Ted, you just have to learn to embrace their hatred. Because behind that hatred lies fear. And you can use use that fear, like I did with Johnny Marley.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26100","Ted","Was there more to that story?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26101","Lily","A little bit.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26102","Ted","Lily, you're a psychopath.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26103","Lily","A little bit. Oh, a panda!","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26104","Ted from 2030","I thought about Lily's advice. And I figured fear was worth a try.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26105","Zoey","Well, Professor Mosby, is there anything you want to say to us?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26106","Ted","Anyone not in class tomorrow gets an ""F.""","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26107","Lily","You said that?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26108","Ted","Well, technically, they'd get an incomplete, but I thought ""F"" had a nice, scary ring to it. Right?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26109","Lily","Yeah.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26110","Robin","Hey, guys.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26111","Lily","Robin, who'd you sleep with?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26112","Robin","I told you-- Randy. He was a machine.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26113","Lily","Where's the poop, Robin?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26114","Robin","Fine. I didn't sleep with anyone. The thing is, ever since Becky did that commercial, everyone at work loves her. So, the day after Halloween, I was in a commercial.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26115","Ted","What... Why didn't you tell us?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26116","Announcer","Bladder trouble; it's embarrassing, it's uncomfortable, and it can affect anyone.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26117","Robin","I'm going to the bathroom right now.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26118","Announcer","Neat and discreet adult diapers for anyone.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26119","Robin","Say... ""Ah...""","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26120","Ted","Wow! I can't wait to see it.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26121","Robin","Well, hopefully you never will. They said that they might not even use it.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26122","Ted from 2030","It ran for seven years.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26123","Randy","Okay, you win. Maybe trashing your office was a mistake. It's just, uh, as long as I can remember, making beer has been my dream. Wharmpiss? I know it sounds dumb to someone who's already achieved his dream, big-time lawyer at a huge corporation.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26124","Marshall","You think working here is my dream?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26125","Randy","Of course. Anyways, I'll clean this stuff up. Have someone get that dead squirrel out of your desk.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26126","Marshall","Randy. This is delicious. You're fired.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26127","Ted from 2030","Kids, the next morning, my class had the highest attendance it had ever had. And not long after that, Randy used his severance money to start a little brewery. Now you can have a Wharmpiss at every bar in America. And all because...","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26128","Marshall","I care about making dreams come true. You got what you need?","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26129","Barney","Yep. That's a wrap.","06","07","Canning Randy"
"26130","Ted from 2030","Kids, one morning in 2010, I opened the newspaper only to discover an op-ed written by Zoey Pierson. You remember Zoey.","06","08","Natural History"
"26131","Zoey","Key Ted Mosby's car.","06","08","Natural History"
"26132","Ted from 2030","In those four column inches, she railed against me and my company, GNB, for wanting to tear down a beautiful old building  The Arcadian. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the piece ran on a Saturday, which as you both know, is Dad's crossword day.","06","08","Natural History"
"26133","Ted","She ruined crossword day! I can't believe this. She singles me out by name. Calls me a ""fat cat."" Me and my ""fat-cat friends."" We're not fat cats.","06","08","Natural History"
"26134","Barney","Exactly. I say, Marshall, my good man, how's my bow tie?","06","08","Natural History"
"26135","Marshall","Impeccable, old bean. To industry!","06","08","Natural History"
"26136","Barney","Ah, bully!","06","08","Natural History"
"26137","Ted from 2030","Okay, that night we weren't entirely un-fat-catty. You see, every year the Natural History Museum holds its Autumn Spectacular. It's attended by some of the most powerful and important people in New York, and, thanks to Goliath National Bank... us.","06","08","Natural History"
"26138","Marshall","Look at us, huh? In tuxedos? Can you imagine if our college selves saw us like this?","06","08","Natural History"
"26139","Ted","They'd pelt us with their Phish bootlegs.","06","08","Natural History"
"26140","Marshall","Yeah, we were pretty anti-establishment back then. Oh, God, remember Russell?","06","08","Natural History"
"26141","Marshall","Nice monkey suit, Russell.","06","08","Natural History"
"26142","Russel","Come on, guys.","06","08","Natural History"
"26143","Marshall","Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you with that corporate noose around your neck. And don't even try showing up to the drum circle this weekend.","06","08","Natural History"
"26144","Ted","Oh, hey. You guys seen Russell? I'm supposed to drive him to his mom's funeral.","06","08","Natural History"
"26145","Robin","I wish I knew you guys back then. You know why? Because you can't kick a story in the nuts.","06","08","Natural History"
"26146","Lily","Hey, we're still those people. One of these days, Marshall's going to quit his job and go to work for the NRDC, and save the world, right, baby?","06","08","Natural History"
"26147","Marshall","Absotively. But let's just remember, I mean, nobody's the same as they were in college. You know, it's like, I wear a suit to work every day.","06","08","Natural History"
"26148","Lily","Well, yeah, but you wear it ironically, like Ted's fanny pack.","06","08","Natural History"
"26149","Ted","Next time we go to Great Adventure, you're carrying your own sunblock.","06","08","Natural History"
"26150","Lily","Ooh! I love this exhibit. One time when I was a kid, this room was closed for cleaning, so I snuck under the rope.","06","08","Natural History"
"26151","Everyone","Ooh.","06","08","Natural History"
"26152","Barney","Wow, that's pretty cool. When I was a kid, I knocked down the blue whale.","06","08","Natural History"
"26153","Marshall","Okay, the giant blue whale hanging from the ceiling?","06","08","Natural History"
"26154","Barney","I was six. My uncle Jerry brought me here for the day. He said, ""Don't touch anything"". To a kid. That's like someone telling us ""Don't look at that girl's perky and impossibly symmetrical knockers.""","06","08","Natural History"
"26155","Everyone","Ooh.","06","08","Natural History"
"26156","Robin","Not bad.","06","08","Natural History"
"26157","Barney","So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale. I'm surprised security didn't stop me on the way in.","06","08","Natural History"
"26158","Robin","Well, I'm sure they don't remember. I mean, it's been like 30 years since that completely made-up story didn't happen.","06","08","Natural History"
"26159","Barney","It happened. And these people don't forget. This is not the Natural Stuff That Happened No More Than Five Minutes Ago Museum. Huh?","06","08","Natural History"
"26160","Arthur","Marshall, Barney, there you are. I want you to meet an old friend of mine from Exeter, George Van Smoot.","06","08","Natural History"
"26161","George","But you can, and should, call me The Captain.","06","08","Natural History"
"26162","Marshall","The Captain?","06","08","Natural History"
"26163","Barney","The Captain?","06","08","Natural History"
"26164","Arthur","Back in school we met during a production of Guys and Dolls. The Captain was Nathan Detroit to my assistant stage manager. Marshall and Barney here, are the future of Goliath National Bank.","06","08","Natural History"
"26165","George","Well, ahoy.","06","08","Natural History"
"26166","Barney","Ahoy.","06","08","Natural History"
"26167","Marshall","Ahoy, The Captain.","06","08","Natural History"
"26168","Arthur","The Captain pretty much paid for this entire shindig.","06","08","Natural History"
"26169","George","Please, enjoy yourselves, have fun, but don't touch anything.","06","08","Natural History"
"26170","Marshall","Thank you, The Captain.","06","08","Natural History"
"26171","Barney","Challenge accepted.","06","08","Natural History"
"26172","Lily","Wow. ""The future of Goliath National Bank""?","06","08","Natural History"
"26173","Marshall","I know, it's so, uh... You know, I totally forgot to tell you, but, um, the other day, Arthur offered me a five-year contract.","06","08","Natural History"
"26174","Lily","Oh, well, don't turn him down here in public. I broke up with Scooter at the prom. Right before the picture, too.","06","08","Natural History"
"26175","Lily","So whatever you do, don't tell him here tonight, 'cause...","06","08","Natural History"
"26176","Marshall","I think I'm going to say yes.","06","08","Natural History"
"26177","Barney","Ah, that's the stuff.","06","08","Natural History"
"26178","Robin","I didn't realize you were small potatoes. And to be clear, I am referring to your testicles.","06","08","Natural History"
"26179","Barney","Impressive. Try this on for size.","06","08","Natural History"
"26180","Robin","You want to dance? Let's dance.","06","08","Natural History"
"26181","Barney","I live for the dance.","06","08","Natural History"
"26182","Robin","Get... your other hand... off my ass.","06","08","Natural History"
"26183","Barney","Sorry, sorry.","06","08","Natural History"
"26184","Lily","What do you mean, you're going to say yes?","06","08","Natural History"
"26185","Marshall","I-I want to keep working at GNB.","06","08","Natural History"
"26186","Lily","But I thought that you...","06","08","Natural History"
"26187","Ted","Guys, guys, guys? Architecture fun fact  If you stand right here, and you whisper, a person all the way across the other end of the room hears it like you're standing right next to them. It's one of the most sophisticated pieces of acoustical design in the world. Watch. (whispers)  Diarrhea. Right? Right?","06","08","Natural History"
"26188","Lily","But a five-year contract. I thought you hated GNB.","06","08","Natural History"
"26189","Marshall","Look, I don't hate all of it. Tonight's fun. Take a look around. I mean, this is pretty high-class.","06","08","Natural History"
"26190","Ted, whispering","Poo-poo. Poo-poo platter.","06","08","Natural History"
"26191","Ted","Zoey? Well, well, well.","06","08","Natural History"
"26192","Zoey","You have got to be kidding me.","06","08","Natural History"
"26193","Ted","So, what are we protesting tonight? Rising cost of jet fuel? The government's oppressive top hat and monocle tax?","06","08","Natural History"
"26194","Zoey","And what are you doing here? Oh, right. Beautiful old building... you're here to knock it down. Can I finish my drink first?","06","08","Natural History"
"26195","George","Darling, there you are.","06","08","Natural History"
"26196","Zoey","Ted, this is my husband.","06","08","Natural History"
"26197","Ted","Yeah, old stuff's great.","06","08","Natural History"
"26198","Robin","Mmm. Ah, this Scotch is good. How's your drink?","06","08","Natural History"
"26199","Barney","This is ridiculous. We are two grown adults standing among the greatest collection of natural artifacts in the Western hemisphere, and look at what we're doing.","06","08","Natural History"
"26200","Robin","You're right.","06","08","Natural History"
"26201","Barney","Want to go touch a bunch of stuff?","06","08","Natural History"
"26202","Robin","Yeah, I do.","06","08","Natural History"
"26203","Ted","So, Captain. How'd you get that name, anyway?","06","08","Natural History"
"26204","George","Gave it to myself. A real man chooses his own name.","06","08","Natural History"
"26205","Ted","Well, pleased to meet you, Captain. I'm Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville.","06","08","Natural History"
"26206","Zoey","This is Ted.","06","08","Natural History"
"26207","George","Capital. Honey, I may cut out early. I have to go check up on the boat.","06","08","Natural History"
"26208","Ted","The boat? There's a boat? You must tell me about this boat, Captain.","06","08","Natural History"
"26209","George","Well, she's an 85-foot sloop.","06","08","Natural History"
"26210","Ted","She!","06","08","Natural History"
"26211","George","Do you like boats? Does the sea call to you like it calls to me?","06","08","Natural History"
"26212","Ted","Yes. The sea is all like, ""Ted, come hang out.""","06","08","Natural History"
"26213","George","I like Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. You're coming on the boat sometime. Stepping off.","06","08","Natural History"
"26214","Ted","Man, I wish me and my dad were as close as you guys are.","06","08","Natural History"
"26215","Zoey","Oh. You want to make this personal? Okay. Destroy Ted Mosby. Now it's personal.","06","08","Natural History"
"26216","Ted","No, if I wanted to make it personal, I'd call you a bored little trophy wife who likes to play activist when the shops on 5th Avenue are closed.","06","08","Natural History"
"26217","Zoey","You're going down.","06","08","Natural History"
"26218","Ted","Down where? To the yacht club? Oh! I would love to. W-w-wait. I'm half Jewish, will that be a problem?","06","08","Natural History"
"26219","Lily","So what about becoming an environmental lawyer? What about saving the world?","06","08","Natural History"
"26220","Ted, whispering","Wieners.","06","08","Natural History"
"26221","Marshall","That was a great dream. But we have a mortgage, and we're trying to have kids. We're grown-ups now, Lily.","06","08","Natural History"
"26222","Ted","Wieners and gonads.","06","08","Natural History"
"26223","Lily","What would College You say if he heard what you were saying right now?","06","08","Natural History"
"26224","Marshall","Honestly? Probably something pretentious, and pseudo-intellectual, like...","06","08","Natural History"
"26225","Ted","Boogers.","06","08","Natural History"
"26226","Marshall","We all change, Lily. You know, you don't spell ""women"" with a ""Y"" anymore. And I'm okay with that. And you need to be okay with the fact that I may never become an environmental lawyer.","06","08","Natural History"
"26227","Lily","So how long have you felt this way?","06","08","Natural History"
"26228","Marshall","Honestly? Since my first day at GNB.","06","08","Natural History"
"26229","Ted","Hershey squirts.","06","08","Natural History"
"26230","Robin","Hey. How do you like my date's tux? Ooh! Uh, a-thank you! Oh, none for him. He's stuffed.","06","08","Natural History"
"26231","Ted","Oh! Zoey! There you are. Oh, my God. You have a monocle. Is this real? Is this really happening?","06","08","Natural History"
"26232","Zoey","Can you excuse us for a moment? Let's go for a walk.","06","08","Natural History"
"26233","Ted","Good luck killing James Bond. (Zoey takes Ted away) Are we allowed in here?","06","08","Natural History"
"26234","Zoey","What do you want from me?","06","08","Natural History"
"26235","Ted","I want my crossword day back. Okay? Go live your perfect little life, and leave me the hell alone.","06","08","Natural History"
"26236","Zoey","My life isn't perfect.","06","08","Natural History"
"26237","Ted","Oh, please, what's your biggest problem? Having to sail back to the marina because the Captain's all out of white Zin? Oh. Great. Now you're crying. Like that's going to get my sympathy.","06","08","Natural History"
"26238","Ted from 2030","It did.","06","08","Natural History"
"26239","Lily","You've known about this for two and a half years? So every time you've talked about wanting to be an environmental lawyer since then, that was a lie.","06","08","Natural History"
"26240","Marshall","Technically, I never lied. You asked me questions, and I responded with made-up words.","06","08","Natural History"
"26241","Lily","What?","06","08","Natural History"
"26242","Lily","So, you'll probably quit GNB in a couple years, right?","06","08","Natural History"
"26243","Marshall","Affirmatootly.","06","08","Natural History"
"26244","Lily","And become an environmental lawyer?","06","08","Natural History"
"26245","Marshall","Yepskerdoodles.","06","08","Natural History"
"26246","Lily","Hey, by the way, do you like this scarf?","06","08","Natural History"
"26247","Marshall","Posititochadochmecochepopocha.","06","08","Natural History"
"26248","Marshall","Lawyered.","06","08","Natural History"
"26249","Lily","Okay, that's also a made-up word.","06","08","Natural History"
"26250","Marshall","Okay. Lily, what do you want from me? I want you to be the person I fell in love with.","06","08","Natural History"
"26251","Barney","Niled it.","06","08","Natural History"
"26252","Museum guard","Excuse me.","06","08","Natural History"
"26253","Barney","Thank God you're here. She's been messing with the exhibits.","06","08","Natural History"
"26254","Zoey","I got married when I was 22 to a man who calls himself The Captain.","06","08","Natural History"
"26255","Ted","He seems like a good guy. He wears those red pants.","06","08","Natural History"
"26256","Zoey","I hate boats, Ted. I do, I hate 'em. I can't be on them. I can't be near them. I can't even think about them without getting seasick. You want to know why I want to save that building? Because when I look up at The Arcadian, I see something big and solid, and right now everything else in my life just feels like I'm on a boat. I know it's crazy to care that much about a building.","06","08","Natural History"
"26257","Ted","It's not crazy at all. I'm the same way. Look, Zoey, The Arcadian should be a landmark, it should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate that we have to tear it down. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of wieners and gonads.","06","08","Natural History"
"26258","Zoey","Ted, that was... really easy.","06","08","Natural History"
"26259","Ted","What?","06","08","Natural History"
"26260","Ted's voice (on a recording)","They're a bunch of wieners and gonads.","06","08","Natural History"
"26261","Zoey","This should be useful.","06","08","Natural History"
"26262","Ted from 2030","And in that moment, another headline appeared before my eyes.","06","08","Natural History"
"26263","Ted","You tricked me.","06","08","Natural History"
"26264","Zoey","Well, it the bug room, Ted. Your ass just got bugged. Oh, the offer still stands. We simply must have you out on the boat sometime.","06","08","Natural History"
"26265","Guard","Well, aren't you two clever. Well, guess what, this museum has seen every kind of prank you can think of. Mummies playing poker, penguins sticking out of volcanoes, dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period hanging out with dinosaurs from the Jurassic period. One time a kid knocked down the blue whale. You name it...","06","08","Natural History"
"26266","Robin","I'm sorry. Did you say someone knocked down the blue whale?","06","08","Natural History"
"26267","Guard","Oh no, not just someone. A six-year-old.","06","08","Natural History"
"26268","Barney","Oh, yeah, that story is legend... (phone ringing) Hold on....dary. And, um, would you happen to know what that young man's name was?","06","08","Natural History"
"26269","Guard","No. But I could, uh, check the files.","06","08","Natural History"
"26270","Barney","Thank you.","06","08","Natural History"
"26271","George","Now, Arthur, your turn. I just sang three songs. Now you-you do your part from Guys and Dolls.","06","08","Natural History"
"26272","Arthur","Take your seats, everyone. The show's about to start. Douche.","06","08","Natural History"
"26273","George","So I hear my wife got you pretty good.","06","08","Natural History"
"26274","Ted","She caught me on tape trashing GNB.","06","08","Natural History"
"26275","George","Oh, that damn recorder. Try being married to that. ""But you said you'd get the corgis neutered this weekend."" ""I said no such thing."" ""Oh, yeah?"" Click. You're a good guy, Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. Tell you what, when Zoey goes to sleep, I'll find that tape and erase it for you. No hard feelings.","06","08","Natural History"
"26276","Ted","Really? You'd do that to your own wife?","06","08","Natural History"
"26277","George","Sure. Why not? I mean, I'm glad she has these little causes, they keep her out of troubles, but when she throws a temper tantrum and it gets in the way of someone doing their job, that's a problem.","06","08","Natural History"
"26278","Ted","No, you know what? Don't erase the tape. And for what it's worth, I don't think she's throwing temper tantrums. I just think she's, you know, standing up for what she believes in. I respect that.","06","08","Natural History"
"26279","George","Hey, what about this? I'll take you out on the boat sometime. You've got to see this boat. She's breathtaking.","06","08","Natural History"
"26280","Ted from 2030","Kids, there's an amazing architectural phenomenon in the Natural History Museum. If you stand in the right spot, you can hear an entire conversation all the way across the room.","06","08","Natural History"
"26281","Guard","July 23, 1981, incident report. At approximately 1000 hours,...vandal dislodged rib from triceratops skeleton...and flung said rib at giant whale. Causing said giant whale to fall in a downward trajectory. And the vandal's name... Well, I'll be damned... Barney Stinson.","06","08","Natural History"
"26282","Barney","Who's the master, Leroy?","06","08","Natural History"
"26283","Guard","Stinson was reprimanded and returned to the custody of his father, Jerome Whittaker.","06","08","Natural History"
"26284","Barney","Uh, no, uncle. Jerome Whittaker is my uncle.","06","08","Natural History"
"26285","Guard","Uncle Jerry. Says father. Even signed it and checked the box for father and everything.","06","08","Natural History"
"26286","Barney","Jerry's my uncle.","06","08","Natural History"
"26287","College Marshall","Lily? Honey, what's wrong? You okay? Do you want a hit of this sandwich?","06","08","Natural History"
"26288","Lily","I want you.","06","08","Natural History"
"26289","College Marshall","Awesome. Let me just put a sock on the doorknob.","06","08","Natural History"
"26290","Lily","No. I mean, I want you as opposed to who you've become. You've changed so much.","06","08","Natural History"
"26291","College Marshall","What? How have I changed? Did I cheat on you?","06","08","Natural History"
"26292","Lily","No.","06","08","Natural History"
"26293","College Marshall","Did I stop writing poems for you?","06","08","Natural History"
"26294","Lily","Yes, but I'm okay with that.","06","08","Natural History"
"26295","College Marshall","Am I not as good at making the sweet, sweet love to you?","06","08","Natural History"
"26296","Lily","Actually, you're way better now. You last, like, two, three times as long.","06","08","Natural History"
"26297","College Marshall","You said that any longer would be too much.","06","08","Natural History"
"26298","Lily","It's okay. College Lily thinks those are orgasms. No, it's... it's none of that. It's just this new Marshall... Corporate Marshall... he wears suits all the time. He doesn't care about saving the world. He's not you. I want you back.","06","08","Natural History"
"26299","College Marshall","Well, you can't have me. Look at the sign. I'm extinct. I've gone the way of Jane's Addiction.","06","08","Natural History"
"26300","Lily","Actually, Jane's Addiction got back together.","06","08","Natural History"
"26301","College Marshall","They did?","06","08","Natural History"
"26302","Lily","Yeah, they've done a few tours, they put out a new album.","06","08","Natural History"
"26303","College Marshall","Are you serious?! That is awesome! Are they just as good?","06","08","Natural History"
"26304","Lily","Sure.","06","08","Natural History"
"26305","College Marshall","Look, I know that Corporate Marshall wears a tie and everything, but it sounds like he hasn't changed where it counts.","06","08","Natural History"
"26306","Marshall","Hey.","06","08","Natural History"
"26307","Lily","Hi.","06","08","Natural History"
"26308","Marshall","Look, Lily, I know that you would have been okay if we were poor and I was trying to save the world, but will you still be okay if I make a lot of money and I spend all of it spoiling you and our kids?","06","08","Natural History"
"26309","Lily","We'll make it work.","06","08","Natural History"
"26310","College Marshall","There he goes. The Marathon Man. Mr. Stamina himself. I can kiss better than that old man.","06","08","Natural History"
"26311","Robin","So when was the last time you saw him?","06","08","Natural History"
"26312","Barney","It was that day... July 23, 1981. My mom got pretty mad that he let me destroy a New York City landmark.","06","08","Natural History"
"26313","Robin","Moms.","06","08","Natural History"
"26314","Barney","He never came around anymore after that. Think he moved away.","06","08","Natural History"
"26315","Robin","Well, maybe the security guy had it wrong. You never know...","06","08","Natural History"
"26316","Barney","But you do know, you do know. That's the thing. You know. He's my dad.","06","08","Natural History"
"26317","Robin","Barney, do you want...?","06","08","Natural History"
"26318","Barney","I don't want to do anything. Don't tell anyone about this, okay?","06","08","Natural History"
"26319","Ted","I'm serious. It's a great look. I think it could come back, but one question. Does it cost half as much as glasses?","06","08","Natural History"
"26320","Zoey","Can I steal you for a second? You don't need to worry. I... What are you doing?","06","08","Natural History"
"26321","Ted","Oh, I thought we were...","06","08","Natural History"
"26322","Zoey","Fine. I erased the tape.","06","08","Natural History"
"26323","Ted","What?","06","08","Natural History"
"26324","Zoey","I don't need it. I'm going to beat you fair and square.","06","08","Natural History"
"26325","Ted","Thanks.","06","08","Natural History"
"26326","Zoey","But it's good to know how easily you can be manipulated by a woman.","06","08","Natural History"
"26327","Ted","You look gross when you cry, you know that? Some women look cute. You look like a basset hound.","06","08","Natural History"
"26328","Zoey","Oh, laugh it up now. Because starting Monday, I got you in my crosshairs.","06","08","Natural History"
"26329","Ted","Bring it on, Princess.","06","08","Natural History"
"26330","Arthur","Eriksen... It's, uh, 3 00 a.m. You know what, you might as well not even go home.","06","08","Natural History"
"26331","Ted from 2030","And so Marshall stayed right on at Goliath National Bank. Of course, it wouldn't last forever. But that's another story.","06","08","Natural History"
"26332","Ted from 2030","Kids, in the fall of 2010, it seemed like Aunt Lily could only talk about one thing  babies.","06","09","Glitter"
"26333","Robin","Oh, God, I have been craving this burger all day.","06","09","Glitter"
"26334","Lily","Do you know what plays a huge role in helping a woman conceive? Cervical mucus.","06","09","Glitter"
"26335","Robin","Oh, my God, I can't wait to see this movie. I hear it's really scary.","06","09","Glitter"
"26336","Lily","Oh, change of plans. I thought violent images wouldn't be good for my future fetus, so instead, I rented this video of a live water birth.","06","09","Glitter"
"26337","Robin","They don't know what it is. It just showed up on my mom's X-ray.","06","09","Glitter"
"26338","Lily","Look at this crib.","06","09","Glitter"
"26339","Ted from 2030","But all in all, it wasn't a problem. That is, until the night of Barney's boutonniere.","06","09","Glitter"
"26340","Marshall","Oh, you're wearing a flower.","06","09","Glitter"
"26341","Barney","Thank you.","06","09","Glitter"
"26342","Marshall","Ah, didn't compliment. Just observed.","06","09","Glitter"
"26343","Barney","I know. Isn't it?","06","09","Glitter"
"26344","Robin","Why are you wearing that?","06","09","Glitter"
"26345","Ted","Why does Barney do anything ever?","06","09","Glitter"
"26346","Barney","Exactly. Science. There is an 83% correlation between the times men wear boutonnieres and the times they get laid. Think about it. Proms, weddings. Grandmas' funerals. Thanks for the redhead, Nana. The ""everyday boutonniere"" by Stinson.","06","09","Glitter"
"26347","Robin","And nope. I'm sorry, Barney, but no girl is going home with a guy with a flower on his chest. Unless he's a clown, and she's in the trunk of his car.","06","09","Glitter"
"26348","Marshall","Along with 50 other clowns. It's a clown car. Oh.","06","09","Glitter"
"26349","Barney","Robin, did you know that boutonniere is French for ""bootie is near?"" True story. Une histoire vraie.","06","09","Glitter"
"26350","Robin","Hmm! Did you know that Barney is French for ""sad little guy who works way too hard to get laid""""","06","09","Glitter"
"26351","Barney","Woman, you best check yourself.","06","09","Glitter"
"26352","Robin","Yeah, on the bright side, I guess suits are pretty boring without them, so...","06","09","Glitter"
"26353","Barney","Madam... that is an insult that cannot be borne! I demand satisfaction!","06","09","Glitter"
"26354","Robin","What, are we gonna duel?","06","09","Glitter"
"26355","Barney","No. I'm going to show everyone this embarrassing video of you. It's Robin Sparkles III, y'all!","06","09","Glitter"
"26356","Ted from 2030","Kids, by this point, we knew Aunt Robin had been a teen pop sensation in Canada, known as Robin Sparkles. And we also knew that her Robin Sparkles character came from a Canadian TV show, which we'd never seen... until now.","06","09","Glitter"
"26357","Barney","I cannot wait to see what's on this DVD!","06","09","Glitter"
"26358","Marshall","Oh, you haven't watched it yet?","06","09","Glitter"
"26359","Barney","No, of course not. I wanted my first time to be with someone I cared about.","06","09","Glitter"
"26360","Marshall","Sweet! I get that a lot. Well, once.","06","09","Glitter"
"26361","Lily","Hey, Robin, do you want to go get a Korean massage on Saturday?","06","09","Glitter"
"26362","Robin","Oh, I'd love to. I've got this knot in my neck that's so annoying.","06","09","Glitter"
"26363","Lily","Yeah, I figured I should get one now because once I get pregnant, no more massages. Just so annoying.","06","09","Glitter"
"26364","Barney","Space Teens?! Is this a porno?","06","09","Glitter"
"26365","Robin","No, no. Dude, dude. Sweet! It's a kids' show.","06","09","Glitter"
"26366","Ted","I don't know. This does have all the earmarks of p0rn. Stripper pole, bad lighting, delusional girl who thinks it's a stepping stone to mainstream success.","06","09","Glitter"
"26367","Barney","Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big old bowl of pornflakes. Whoa! And who is this exquisite keytarist I assum you're about to make sweet love to?","06","09","Glitter"
"26368","Robin","Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life.","06","09","Glitter"
"26369","Barney","Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers? Get mad at each other and wrestle, but then end up kissing in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily.","06","09","Glitter"
"26370","Robin","Barney, you know what? If you're going to be disgusting, we're not watching this, okay?","06","09","Glitter"
"26371","Lily","Yeah. Come on, Barney. It's just a cute little story about... What exactly is this about?","06","09","Glitter"
"26372","Robin","Oh, two average Canadian teenagers who solve crimes in space using math.","06","09","Glitter"
"26373","Marshall","That sounds ridiculous.","06","09","Glitter"
"26374","Robin Sparkles","So sue me. Like the producers of Milky Way Mathletes tried to.","06","09","Glitter"
"26375","Jessica Glitter","Great job using long division to catch that space burglar, eh?","06","09","Glitter"
"26376","Robin Sparkles","Well, what can I say? He'll be in galactic jail for the remainder of his life.","06","09","Glitter"
"26377","Robot","Sparkles, Glitter, we're about to enter an asteroid belt, eh.","06","09","Glitter"
"26378","Robin Sparkles","Brace for turbulence!","06","09","Glitter"
"26379","Lily","Oh. Oh. I have to say, as much as I hate to agree with Barney, this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia.","06","09","Glitter"
"26380","Robin","Okay, guys, come on. It's a kids' show! Like Electric Company or Sesame Street or, um...","06","09","Glitter"
"26381","Marshall","You can't do that on television.","06","09","Glitter"
"26382","Robin","Exactly.","06","09","Glitter"
"26383","Marshall","No. You can't do that on television!","06","09","Glitter"
"26384","Ted","Robin, this show is so dirty, I don't know whether to hug you or run a shower for you so you can sit there alone, crying and clenching your knees.","06","09","Glitter"
"26385","Robin","It's just bad camera work, okay? Wayne, our camera guy... he wasn't that great.","06","09","Glitter"
"26386","Marshall","I don't know. I think he did a pretty good job, considering he was probably only using one hand.","06","09","Glitter"
"26387","Robin","You know what? I feel bad for you Americans, that you can look at this wondrous and educational adventure through space, and see something obscene. Can you just please try to look at this with the innocence of a child?","06","09","Glitter"
"26388","Man","Coming up. Here we go. Girls, if you want to get through the asteroid belt, you've got to use multiplication. To the joystick! Okay, Space Teens, let's multiply! Five times six?","06","09","Glitter"
"26389","Robin Sparkles","Oh. 30.","06","09","Glitter"
"26390","Man","Yes! Oh! Seven times four?","06","09","Glitter"
"26391","Jessica Glitter","28!","06","09","Glitter"
"26392","Man","Keep going! Eight times nine?","06","09","Glitter"
"26393","Jessica Glitter","72!","06","09","Glitter"
"26394","Man","Don't stop now! Almost there! 23 times three?","06","09","Glitter"
"26395","Barney","I'm sorry. We got to ration this. It's like we're on a desert island, and this video is a really hot, naked chick, and she's got, like, seaweed on her and a seashell bra. You all feel me?","06","09","Glitter"
"26396","Lily","Hey, if you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her?","06","09","Glitter"
"26397","Robin","Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card from her every year, but we're not really friends anymore.","06","09","Glitter"
"26398","Lily","But BFFs are forever.","06","09","Glitter"
"26399","Marshall","Oh, come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends with their high school friends.","06","09","Glitter"
"26400","Ted","I'm still friends with Punchy.","06","09","Glitter"
"26401","Marshall","Dude, he lives in Cleveland. You see him once a year, at which point, he punches you really hard in the arm and tells everyone how you dookied your pants. I know, on paper he sounds great, but you guys aren't really friends.","06","09","Glitter"
"26402","Ted","Look, I may not see him a lot, but it doesn't matter. Observe.","06","09","Glitter"
"26403","Punchy","Schmosby!","06","09","Glitter"
"26404","Ted","Punchy!","06","09","Glitter"
"26405","Punchy","Hey, good talking to you, Ted.","06","09","Glitter"
"26406","Ted","Yeah, you, too. If you're ever in New York.","06","09","Glitter"
"26407","Punchy","Definitely.","06","09","Glitter"
"26408","Ted","We are just two peas.","06","09","Glitter"
"26409","Lily","I don't get it. How can you and Glitter just stop being friends? Best friends don't do that.","06","09","Glitter"
"26410","Robin","Well, we did, okay? And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it. I got to go.","06","09","Glitter"
"26411","Lily","Whoa. What do you think came between Robin and Jessica?","06","09","Glitter"
"26412","Ted","Much like our friends, the Space Teens, I think I can solve this crime with math. Okay... Okay, here is a Christmas card that Jessica sent Robin. Lily, how old would you say that kid is?","06","09","Glitter"
"26413","Lily","Four years, three months.","06","09","Glitter"
"26414","Ted","Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago. Right around the time she and Robin stopped being friends.","06","09","Glitter"
"26415","Marshall","Of course. Robin hates kids.","06","09","Glitter"
"26416","Barney","The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat.","06","09","Glitter"
"26417","Ted","Thus, if I may... When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear, Robin said, ""To hell with this, I'm outta hare. Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her.","06","09","Glitter"
"26418","Marshall","That's got to be it, right, Lil? Lil?","06","09","Glitter"
"26419","Lily","Robin's gonna dump me!","06","09","Glitter"
"26420","Marshall","Oh, sweetheart.","06","09","Glitter"
"26421","Ted","When a second uterus plumped becomes...","06","09","Glitter"
"26422","Marshall","Dude. Feel the room.","06","09","Glitter"
"26423","Robin","No.","06","09","Glitter"
"26424","Ted","We've been waiting all day!","06","09","Glitter"
"26425","Robin","Just watch it without me.","06","09","Glitter"
"26426","Barney","Two dudes on the couch together watching p0rn? That's kind of weird.","06","09","Glitter"
"26427","Robin","Okay, it's not p0rn, it's a kids' show.","06","09","Glitter"
"26428","Ted","Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse.","06","09","Glitter"
"26429","Robin","Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off.","06","09","Glitter"
"26430","Barney","We...","06","09","Glitter"
"26431","Robin","I'm serious.","06","09","Glitter"
"26432","Robin Sparkles","Hey Jessica, how's your beaver?","06","09","Glitter"
"26433","Jessica Glitter","Great. How's your beaver?","06","09","Glitter"
"26434","Robin Sparkles","Busy as ever!","06","09","Glitter"
"26435","Robin","Our characters had pet beavers.","06","09","Glitter"
"26436","Ted","Sure.","06","09","Glitter"
"26437","Robin","The beaver is the official animal of Canada. It's our national mascot.","06","09","Glitter"
"26438","Barney","It's a noble creature.","06","09","Glitter"
"26439","Man","Okay, girls. Everyone knows a beaver's favorite food is wood. I just hope we brought along enough of it for our three-day galactic space journey. So let's do the math. If Robin's beaver devours six inches of wood every half hour, and Jessica's beaver devours eight inches of wood every 45 minutes, how much wood will I need to keep both of these beavers well-fed all weekend long? While you figure it out at home, how about we sing you a song about our beavers?","06","09","Glitter"
"26440","Robin","Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable!","06","09","Glitter"
"26441","Barney","No arguments here.","06","09","Glitter"
"26442","Punchy","'Sup Shmosby!","06","09","Glitter"
"26443","Ted","Punchy, what are you doing here?","06","09","Glitter"
"26444","Punchy","Well, yesterday you said if I was ever in New York. 'Sup, turds?","06","09","Glitter"
"26445","Ted","Okay, uh, uh, where are you staying?","06","09","Glitter"
"26446","Punchy","In your mom's pants. Trick. She's old. Hey, don't worry about me. I'm cool on the couch.","06","09","Glitter"
"26447","Robin","Whoa. He's staying here? You're staying here?","06","09","Glitter"
"26448","Punchy","I know! It's so good, right? Feel like you're dreaming? But check your totem, brah. Punchy's here in the flesh. So, why don't we get one of these, Ted? Yeah. Remember these? High school? Junior high? Yeah. Elementary school? Remember those?","06","09","Glitter"
"26449","Punchy","Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied in your pants down by the lake? Unbelievable!","06","09","Glitter"
"26450","Robin","Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied on our couch in the form of your idiot high school friend? Unbelievable!","06","09","Glitter"
"26451","Ted","Come on. I worry about the guy. He's had the same dead-end job at a car rental place for 15 years.","06","09","Glitter"
"26452","Robin","Don't care.","06","09","Glitter"
"26453","Ted","He's been stuck in Cleveland his whole life.","06","09","Glitter"
"26454","Robin","Get a hotel.","06","09","Glitter"
"26455","Ted","Robin... LeBron.","06","09","Glitter"
"26456","Robin","Okay, one night. Got to go.","06","09","Glitter"
"26457","Lily","Where are you going? We just got here.","06","09","Glitter"
"26458","Robin","Oh, a Korean massage.","06","09","Glitter"
"26459","Lily","By yourself?","06","09","Glitter"
"26460","Robin","Well, I figured you'd be busy, reading What to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect.","06","09","Glitter"
"26461","Lily","Guys, did you see that? She's going to a Korean massage without me. That's our thing. I'm telling you, she's gonna dump me, just like she dumped Glitter.","06","09","Glitter"
"26462","Marshall","Lily, come on. We don't even know that's what happened.","06","09","Glitter"
"26463","Ted","Um, hello, somebody already solved that crime using math, remember?","06","09","Glitter"
"26464","Marshall","Look, Lily. Robin is clearly getting tired of you constantly talking about babies.","06","09","Glitter"
"26465","Lily","I don't.","06","09","Glitter"
"26466","Marshall","Lily, how old am I?","06","09","Glitter"
"26467","Lily","384 months.","06","09","Glitter"
"26468","Punchy","Busted!","06","09","Glitter"
"26469","Marshall","Okay. So before you Lily all over the place, maybe you should try hanging out with Robin and not talking about babies.","06","09","Glitter"
"26470","Ted from 2030","So Lily did just that. She tried not to talk about babies.","06","09","Glitter"
"26471","Robin","Hey, Lily, what brings you to the crib?","06","09","Glitter"
"26472","Lily","Crib...","06","09","Glitter"
"26473","Robin","What's the matter? You look rattled.","06","09","Glitter"
"26474","Lily","Rattled? I want to talk about babies.","06","09","Glitter"
"26475","Robin","What?","06","09","Glitter"
"26476","Lily","Look, I know you don't care about this stuff, but I'm about to become a mother. And as a future mother, I'm gonna need the support...","06","09","Glitter"
"26477","Robin","Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet.","06","09","Glitter"
"26478","Lily","What's that supposed to mean?","06","09","Glitter"
"26479","Robin","It means that a fertilized egg has not yet attached itself to the lining of your uterine wall. You see? I read your Facebook updates. God, it's like it's all you ever talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it!","06","09","Glitter"
"26480","Lily","Well, guess what? I've got some good news. When that baby comes, you don't have to see it. In fact, you don't have to see me. This whole friendship thing? Done.","06","09","Glitter"
"26481","Robin","Great.","06","09","Glitter"
"26482","Lily","Great.","06","09","Glitter"
"26483","Marshall","For crying out loud. You broke up with Robin?","06","09","Glitter"
"26484","Lily","I had to. We were growing apart, and we're better off without each other.","06","09","Glitter"
"26485","Marshall","Okay, Lily, you sound about as convincing as you did the time you ""accidentally"" shredded my Joey Buttafuoco pants.","06","09","Glitter"
"26486","Lily","No!","06","09","Glitter"
"26487","Marshall","Get on the phone, call Robin and fix this.","06","09","Glitter"
"26488","Lily","I can't. The damage is done. Can you just hold me?","06","09","Glitter"
"26489","Marshall","You know what? No. I don't agree with what you did, and so I refuse to comfort you, despite how adorable you are when you cry.","06","09","Glitter"
"26490","Lily","Okay.","06","09","Glitter"
"26491","Marshall","Okay. Maybe just one cuddle, but then that is it.","06","09","Glitter"
"26492","Punchy","Times Square's the bomb! I got so many great pictures of all the billboards.","06","09","Glitter"
"26493","Ted","Yeah. You know, there's more to New York than Times Square. There's the Village, the Lower East Side, Central Park...","06","09","Glitter"
"26494","Punchy","They got better billboards then the ones in Times Square?","06","09","Glitter"
"26495","Ted","No.","06","09","Glitter"
"26496","Punchy","Times Square's the bomb!","06","09","Glitter"
"26497","Ted","Here. You know what? Hold this, okay?","06","09","Glitter"
"26498","Punchy","I'm going to go pee in the jar I got going in the alley.","06","09","Glitter"
"26499","Barney","Seriously, dude, he has got to go. You need to be like, ""You are the weakest link. Goodbye."" Punchy, the tribe has spoken. Please pack up your knives and go. Your work of art didn't work for us. Your time's up. I have to ask you to leave the mansion. You must leave the chateau. Your tour ends here. You've been chopped.","06","09","Glitter"
"26500","Ted","Okay, yeah. I know.","06","09","Glitter"
"26501","Barney","You've been evicted from the Big Brother house. Your dessert just didn't measure up. Sashay away. Give me your jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen. I'm sorry, you did not get a rose. You have been eliminated from the race. You are no longer in the running to be America's Next Top Model. You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen.","06","09","Glitter"
"26502","Punchy","Ted, come look at this. I found a little wounded bird in the alley.","06","09","Glitter"
"26503","Ted","That's your scrotum.","06","09","Glitter"
"26504","Punchy","You know what it is, Ted. You know what it is. Come on, Ted. You always fall for that.","06","09","Glitter"
"26505","Ted","Yeah, he's gotta go.","06","09","Glitter"
"26506","Lily","What are we doing in Madison Square Garden?","06","09","Glitter"
"26507","Marshall","Okay, you refused to talk to Robin. So I thought that you might like to talk to... the organist for the New York Rangers. Jessica Glitter?!","06","09","Glitter"
"26508","Lily","How did you find Glitter?","06","09","Glitter"
"26509","Marshall","Simple, really. I used my powers of deduction. You see, I knew Glitter used to be a keytarist, which is basically a piano, so I just made a list of all the keyboard-based occupations and then I cross-matched them...","06","09","Glitter"
"26510","Jessica Glitter","His friend Barney looked me up, hoping to buy my Space Teens costume.","06","09","Glitter"
"26511","Marshall","Yo, Glitter... Be cool.","06","09","Glitter"
"26512","Jessica Glitter","So, is this the one who's best friends with Robin now?","06","09","Glitter"
"26513","Lily","More like ex-best friends. Just like you.","06","09","Glitter"
"26514","Jessica Glitter","I'm sorry to hear that. I miss Robin.","06","09","Glitter"
"26515","Lily","Yeah, well, Marshall and I are about to get pregnant, and I know she stopped being friends with you when you had a baby, so...","06","09","Glitter"
"26516","Jessica Glitter","Oh, Robin didn't stop being friends with me. I stopped being friends with her.","06","09","Glitter"
"26517","Lily","What? Why?","06","09","Glitter"
"26518","Jessica Glitter","Because I had a baby. Honey, when you have a baby, all that best friend stuff-- hockey, bow hunting for caribou, math...that all goes out the window. I mean, I tried to stay friends with her, but it just didn't happen. She took it pretty hard. I even thought she might try to kill herself.","06","09","Glitter"
"26519","Marshall","Charge!","06","09","Glitter"
"26520","Lily","Wow. You dumped her just because you had a baby? That's cold.","06","09","Glitter"
"26521","Jessica Glitter","Didn't you do the same thing? Minus the baby?","06","09","Glitter"
"26522","Lily","Oh, God. I gotta go. I gotta go apologize to Robin. I- I need to tell her I love her, and that she'll always be a priority.","06","09","Glitter"
"26523","Jessica Glitter","Be careful, Lily. I made those promises, too. And now I haven't even talked to her in five years. Sure, I thought about picking up the phone and calling her a hundred times, but I just never have the courage to actually...(Marshall is playing the piano) Hey. Go ahead.","06","09","Glitter"
"26524","Punchy","Hey, do you guys get Big Chuck and Little John out here?","06","09","Glitter"
"26525","Ted","Punchy, it's time to go back.","06","09","Glitter"
"26526","Punchy","Back to Times Square?!","06","09","Glitter"
"26527","Ted","Uh, no. Back-Back to Cleveland.","06","09","Glitter"
"26528","Punchy","I don't know if I can do that, bro. I mean, yeah, I've been jonesing for a piece of Cleveland-style pizza, but I feel bad about leaving you out here. I worry about you, Ted.","06","09","Glitter"
"26529","Ted","You worry about me?","06","09","Glitter"
"26530","Punchy","Yeah. The other day, when you called...","06","09","Glitter"
"26531","Punchy","Schmosby!","06","09","Glitter"
"26532","Ted","Punchy!","06","09","Glitter"
"26533","Punchy","Hey, good talking to you, Ted.","06","09","Glitter"
"26534","Ted","Yeah. You, too. If you're ever in New York...","06","09","Glitter"
"26535","Punchy","Definitely.","06","09","Glitter"
"26536","Woman","Sweetie, who was that?","06","09","Glitter"
"26537","Punchy","It was my friend Ted. He sounded kind of depressed.","06","09","Glitter"
"26538","Woman","Is this the Ted who got left at the altar?","06","09","Glitter"
"26539","Punchy","Yeah. He's not doing so good. Poor guy lives in a tiny apartment in New York, nowhere near Times Square. He's got no family around. He's still single, doesn't have a backyard. It's just a bummer.","06","09","Glitter"
"26540","Woman","Maybe you should go visit him. Cheer him up a little. You know, buy him some shots, do the whole wounded bird trick.","06","09","Glitter"
"26541","Punchy","You think that would work?","06","09","Glitter"
"26542","Woman","Worked on me.","06","09","Glitter"
"26543","Ted","Wow. She sounds pretty great, Punchy.","06","09","Glitter"
"26544","Punchy","She's my angel. In fact, uh... We're getting married.","06","09","Glitter"
"26545","Ted","Wow! Wow! That's... I'm-I'm really happy for you.","06","09","Glitter"
"26546","Punchy","Thanks, Ted. Thanks. Actually, that's the other reason why I came out here. I wanted to see if you'd be my best man.","06","09","Glitter"
"26547","Ted","Of course I will.","06","09","Glitter"
"26548","Punchy","Yeah! That's great! No, you're stupid. Oh, that's it...","06","09","Glitter"
"26549","Ted from 2030","That night, Lily went to the one place she knew she could find Robin-- New York's premiere Canadian bar, the Hoser Hut.","06","09","Glitter"
"26550","Lily","Oh, there you are. Robin, I owe you a huge apology.","06","09","Glitter"
"26551","Robin","No, okay? Me first. I've been pulling away from you, and I'm sorry. It's just, the last time my best friend had a baby...","06","09","Glitter"
"26552","Lily","I know. I know all about it. It's not gonna happen with you and me. And I'm sorry I've been going crazy with this baby stuff. I know you hate babies.","06","09","Glitter"
"26553","Robin","Whoa. Look, I hate most babies. But your baby? I'm gonna love that kid so much. I'm gonna pick it up and everything.","06","09","Glitter"
"26554","Marshall","I'm so happy you guys made up.","06","09","Glitter"
"26555","Ted","Me, too.","06","09","Glitter"
"26556","Barney","Where do I know this song from?","06","09","Glitter"
"26557","Robin","Oh, my God. It's the beaver song. Okay, which one of you put this on?","06","09","Glitter"
"26558","Jessica, singing","* Hey, beaver, come on; When you feel alone; Just pick up that phone; And I'll be there to share my... *","06","09","Glitter"
"26559","Robin and Jessica","* Ice cream cone; We'll lick it side by side *","06","09","Glitter"
"26560","Barney","Wow. This is so dirty.","06","09","Glitter"
"26561","Marshall","Come on, Barney. It's a sweet song about friendship.","06","09","Glitter"
"26562","Ted","Yeah, dude, come on.","06","09","Glitter"
"26563","Robin and Jessica","* Day is done; Two beavers are better than one; Dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah; Two beavers are better than one; They're twice the fun; Ask anyone; A second beaver can be second to none; Two beavers are better than one. *","06","09","Glitter"
"26564","Robin","*Dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah...*","06","09","Glitter"
"26565","Jessica","*You're my favorite beaver...*","06","09","Glitter"
"26566","Robin and Jessica","*Two beavers are better than one. Dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah; Two beavers are better than one; They're twice the fun; Ask anyone; A second beaver ; Can be second to none.*","06","09","Glitter"
"26567","Robot","Two beavers are better than one. *","06","09","Glitter"
"26568","Ted from 2030","Kids, in the fall of 2010, I was hosting my very first Thanksgiving. And I wanted it to be unforgettable.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26569","Ted","Instead of stuffing, I'm going to fill the turkey with... a slightly smaller turkey. It's called a Turturkeykey!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26570","Lily","A Turturkeykey?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26571","Robin","Yeah, I was there for the ""insertion."" He used shoehorns. I'll be having sides.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26572","Ted","Your loss. All right, it's dead in here. I'm gonna call it a little early.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26573","Barney","What? No! You can't go now. It's the night before Thanksgiving. College chicks are back in town. Their moms just made a snide comment about the weight they gained. They called her a bitch, but deep down, they know she's right. And they're about to walk through that door, where we will be waiting with some light beer and some rock hard approval. Wh-what u-up?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26574","Marshall","Yeah. You don't want to bail early, man. You could become The Blitz.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26575","Ted from 2030","Blitz was a guy we knew in college. Sadly, he was cursed.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26576","Blitz","Well... I'm calling it a little early.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26577","Ted","Wh... you sure? We got big plans.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26578","Marshall","Yeah. Remember how last week we fired up a sandwich, and we listened to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon while watching The Wizard of Oz?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26579","Ted","Well, tonight, we're doing the same thing, only with ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's Greatest Hits and Apocalypse Now.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26580","Marshall","We'll see what happens.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26581","Blitz","Nah, it's Kraft/Croft night  mac and cheese and Tomb Raider. Biz-zow!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26582","Ted from 2030","You see, every time Blitz left a place, something amazing happened.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26583","Woman","Oh! I'm sorry. I thought this was my room.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26584","Ted","Completely naked!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26585","Marshall","Completely naked!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26586","Blitz","Aw, man!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26587","Marshall","And the movie was awesome.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26588","Blitz","Aw, man!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26589","Ted","At the exact moment Brando first appeared, ""Weird Al"" launched right into ""Eat It.""","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26590","Blitz","Aw, man!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26591","Ted from 2030","And over the years, ""The Curse of The Blitz"" continued.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26592","Blitz","Well, I'm gonna call it. I just got Madden 2K1, and I can't stop thinking about it.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26593","Bar Tender","Tap's broke! Can't turn 'em off! Free beer for everyone!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26594","Ted","Free beer for everyone!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26595","Marshall","Free beer for everyone!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26596","Blitz","Aw, man!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26597","Marshall","You know what? Ted, go ahead-- leave early to do something lame. Just don't blame us if you become... The Blitz.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26598","Ted","All right, first of all... there's nothing lame about brining a Turturkeykey, copyright pending. And secondly, I don't believe ""The Curse of The Blitz"" is real. (gasps)","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26599","Ted from 2030","Kids, I'd live to regret those words. You see, the ""Curse of Blitz"" could be passed from one person to the next, at any moment. Blitz had gotten the curse from Jerry Windheim, back in freshman year, who got it years before that from Davey Beaterman. The original Blitz, Matt Blitz, was a guy who went to Wesleyan back in the '60s. He dropped out right before the school went co-ed. And then, Thanksgiving morning...","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26600","Ted","What the hell happened here?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26601","Robin","Hey! Morning, Blitz!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26602","Ted","Aw, man! No, no! Let's get one thing straight, okay? I am not The Blitz.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26603","Barney, singing","My Blitzy lies over the ocean; My Blitzy lies over the sea; My Blitzy lies over the ocean; So bring back my Blitzy...","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26604","Ted","Please stop. Okay, fine.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26605","Barney","...To me.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26606","Lily","The Gentleman!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26607","Everyone","The Gentleman!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26608","Ted","Wait! Wait! Wait! What's that? What's ""The Gentleman""?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26609","Lily","Oh, you had to be there, Blitz. Yes.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26610","Ted","I'm not The Blitz! (Ted goes into the bathroom, he hears a person yawning and opens the bath curtain) Zoey?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26611","Zoey","Morning, Blitz!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26612","Ted from 2030","Kids, you remember Zoey. For the last two months, she'd been making my life hell.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26613","Zoey","Thanks, guys! Last night was amazing! The Gentleman!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26614","Everyone","The Gentle...","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26615","Ted","How could you, my best friends in the world, hang out with my mortal enemy, then let her sleep in the tub where I clean myself?!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26616","Lily","Sorry, Ted. We can explain. After you Blitzed out last night...","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26617","Ted","I'm not The Blitz!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26618","Lily","Oh, my God... That's Zoey! That's Ted's enemy. Which means she's our enemy. Let's take this bitch down.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26619","Lily","Huh? Huh? Who's got your back? Now let's have dinner!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26620","Ted","Finish the story, Red.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26621","Lily","Okay, well, we all started brainstorming ways to mess with her. There were a lot of different ideas kicking around.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26622","Barney","And then I'm just going to leave her there... buck-naked, covered in candle wax, tied to the bed.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26623","Marshall","Barney, I know that Ted doesn't like that girl, but that's a little extreme.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26624","Barney","Wait... Ted doesn't like that girl?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26625","Lily","Okay. Wh...? Well, I got it. You see that silk scarf? I'm going to steal it.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26626","Zoey","Can I... help you?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26627","Lily","Yeah. Yeah! My name is Lily Aldrin. I'm a friend of Ted Mosby's, so you better...","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26628","Zoey","You're Lily Aldrin? The painter?!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26629","Lily","Well, yeah.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26630","Zoey","You're amazing! I bought a bunch of your paintings online.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26631","Lily","(gasps) That was you?!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26632","Zoey","Yeah.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26633","Lily","Oh! Thanks!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26634","Robin","Look, none of us meant for it to happen, but, well, we had an awesome night with her.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26635","Everyone","The Gentleman! (whooping, applause)","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26636","Lily","And then, the craziest thing happened.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26637","Ted","I missed a skateboarding dog?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26638","Lily","Yeah, but that wasn't the crazy part.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26639","Ted","It wasn't?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26640","Zoey","Okay, Marshall. Truth or dare?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26641","Marshall","Okay, awesome. Well, Lily doesn't let me do truths. So, dare.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26642","Zoey","Okay. I dare you to send a picture of your junk to a complete stranger.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26643","Marshall","Best idea ever!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26644","Marshall","Worst idea ever! My junk ended up in some stranger's pocket. If there phone was on vibrate, I basically dry-humped them.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26645","Zoey","Okay. Everybody shout out random numbers.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26646","Blitz","4, 8... 15, 16, 23, 42!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26647","Zoey","And... send!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26648","Ted","Wait. Blitz was there, too?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26649","Blitz","The Gentleman!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26650","Everyone","The Gentleman!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26651","Blitz","Oh, I was there for the whole thing. Something inside me just said ""Grand Theft Auto"" can wait a night.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26652","Barney","It was legen-- wait for Ted to leave, 'cause he's now The Blitz-- -- dary. Legendary!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26653","Ted","I'm not The Blitz!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26654","Marshall","I'm afraid you are, Ted. You see, when you left last night, you changed the course of Blitztory.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26655","Mysterious voice","Blitz...","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26656","Blitz","I'm finally free! I mean, you have no idea what I've missed all these years  The university president's toupee being snatched by a hawk at graduation, Zeppelin reuniting at my cousin Ira's bar mitzvah, countless nip-slips, crotch shots, shooting stars and double rainbows. I've missed them all!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26657","Barney","Well, not anymore, Blitz.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26658","Blitz","My name's not Blitz. My name is Steve! Colors seem so bright now. Thank you, Blitz.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26659","Ted","What? No! N- n-n-n-no! N-n-no! I'm not The Blitz! The only thing I missed last night was my best friends stabbing me in the back by hanging out with my worst enemy. Guys! I hate Zoey! That means you're supposed to hate her, too! Th-that's your rule, Lily!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26660","Lily","I tried.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26661","Ted","Tried?! Lily, do you have any idea how many people I've blindly hated for you? I hated Renée Zellweger with a burning passion for eight years, only to discover you meant Reese Witherspoon!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26662","Lily","Hey, I will hate her until I get my money back for You, Me and Dupree!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26663","Ted","That's Kate Hudson!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26664","Lily","Oh, yeah. That's who I hate. Guys, we hate Kate Hudson.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26665","Ted","No, we hate Zoey! I'm so furious at you all right now, but it's Thanksgiving, and I have a Turturkeykey to make. And not that I'm The Blitz, but could everyone please come with me into the kitchen? (all murmuring) Okay, I'm, uh, just gonna preheat the oven.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26666","Robin","The oven.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26667","Barney","Hey, Robin, you should dance on the oven.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26668","Everyone, chanting","Make out with Zoey! Make out with Zoey! Make out...","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26669","Steve","Did they tell you about the skateboarding dog? It was awesome!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26670","Ted","Great. So not only did you guys betray me, but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26671","Barney","Full disclosure. We also used all your butter, greasing up Lily so we could see how far we could slide her down the hall.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26672","Lily","But if it helps, I reached 4G.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26673","Ted","It doesn't help. 4G? No. What-What are we supposed to do now?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26674","Steve","This is awesome! I'm part of this!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26675","Ted","Barney, I don't know if the oven is deep enough. Plus, it's a display made of cardboard.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26676","Barney","Huh. I should probably disconnect the gas.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26677","Marshall","Hey, just so you guys know, there was a tiny explosion at the sewage treatment plant across the street from our apartment, but I'm sure it's fine by now.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26678","Steve","This is awesome!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26679","Ted","It's not awesome!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26680","Robin","I think the smaller turkey just tried to crawl further inside the bigger turkey.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26681","Barney","Um... Um... I'm have... I'm having trouble breathing!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26682","Steve","Mom keeps an extra litter box in here. There you go. Good as new. Oh. Hey, Ginger.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26683","Lily","Ted, you're not gonna like this, but we do have one other option.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26684","Zoey","Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone anyway.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26685","Lily","Could we bring Ted?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26686","Zoey","It's Thanksgiving. What the hell?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26687","Ted","No. Absolutely not.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26688","Lily","Come on. Give her a chance.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26689","Robin","Ted, you violated a dead turkey with another dead turkey. Don't let that be in vain.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26690","Marshall","Guys? Wait a minute. Where's Barney?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26691","Barney","And here's the twist, Babaka. Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26692","Babaka","But Barney, now you left the group. Wouldn't that put you in danger of becoming The Blitz yourself?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26693","Barney","No. I c... Because... Step on it.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26694","Marshall","You missed it.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26695","Steve","Oh, my goodness. Our cab took a wrong turn. We were in the Thanksgiving Day parade!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26696","Robin","Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike and he sang ""Twist and Shout!""","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26697","Barney","But he's The Blitz.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26698","Ted","No. I'm not The Blitz. I'm The Bueller. You know what this means. You're The Blitz.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26699","Mysterious voice","Blitz...","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26700","Barney","Oh, God, no!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26701","Marshall","Life moves pretty fast, Barney. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26702","Ted","Chicka-chicka!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26703","Zoey","Happy Thanksgiving! Ted.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26704","Ted","Zoey.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26705","Lily","Best friend alert!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26706","Ted","Okay, the Turturkeykey is officially cooking.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26707","Marshall","Oh, God, that is disgusting!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26708","Ted","Okay, guys, that's starting to hurt.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26709","Marshall","No... no, Ted. Random number guy just sent me his wang back.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26710","Robin","Wow. You sent a wang out, and you got a wang back.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26711","Lily","It's a boom-a-wang.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26712","Robin","Nice.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26713","Lily","Thank you.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26714","Robin","No, I meant the wang.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26715","Zoey","Barney, could you get me some more ice?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26716","Barney","Sure. But... no one move while I'm gone. (whispering)  I'm scared.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26717","Steve","You're safe. It's okay to leave the room. You have to actually leave the building for something cool to happen.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26718","Barney","Thanks. You're the only one who's nice to me about this.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26719","Steve","Okay, I got to test this.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26720","Barney","What happened?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26721","Lily","You missed it!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26722","Marshall","Dude, you walked out of the room, the laws of physics stopped and the laws of awesome tripled.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26723","Barney","Aw, man! You said I could leave the room!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26724","Steve","I just wanted to see something cool happen. I'm sorry. But I was on that island for what seems like eternity. I'm going to enjoy things on the other side.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26725","Barney","No! Y-You... Robin, Robin. I will pay you to be The Blitz. $100! No-- $10,000. No-- 60 bucks. That's a lot of money for someone like you.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26726","Marshall","Dude, The Blitz isn't something that can be bought or sold.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26727","Zoey","Yeah, it's not like Ted's integrity.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26728","Ted","Oh, what was that? I was distracted by the four-caret diamond your 53-year-old husband bought you.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26729","Steve","Facial!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26730","Ted","Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a turturkeykey to baste.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26731","Zoey","I'm coming with you.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26732","Ted","No... I baste alone.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26733","Zoey","Oh, I'm sure you're a master baster, Ted.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26734","Steve","Word play. Loving it.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26735","Zoey","But relax. I've got a ton of sides to heat up since my plans fell through.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26736","Ted","Who canceled? Your coven?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26737","Steve","Coven. Group of witches.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26738","Zoey","Yeah. They were worn out from putting that spell on your hair.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26739","Steve","Oh! Serve returned.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26740","Ted","Are you happy? You're ruining Thanksgiving.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26741","Zoey","Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26742","Steve","God, I'm so happy to be here. My face hurts from smiling.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26743","Ted","Oh... I'm sorry, Lily. I'm just never going to like that woman.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26744","Lily","Ted, give her a chance.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26745","Ted","Enemies can't become friends.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26746","Zoey","Yes, they can. Right, guys?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26747","Ted","No, no, no. You guys can't be objective. You still feel guilty about last night.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26748","Robin","Well, let's get an outside opinion.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26749","Ted","Who are we gonna...","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26750","Robin","""Dear Wang Guy...Can enemies ever be friends? Just wondering.""","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26751","Ted","Really? Wang Guy? We're asking Wang Guy?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26752","Robin","He's bold and uninhibited, so why not? And guys, you know what? For fun, why don't we ask him what he does for a living? Wouldn't that be fun? Just ask...","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26753","Lily","Aww. You've got a little crush on Wang Guy, don't you?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26754","Robin","What? No. Shut up. I hate him.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26755","Marshall","Oh, look. We got an answer. Here it is. ""Yes, enemies can become friends. ""Remember what Gandhi said. 'Be the change you want to see in the world.'""","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26756","Steve","Uh, did Wang Guy just quote Gandhi?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26757","Barney, laughing","That is amazing. And I was here for it. Now Zoey is The Blitz. Ha, ha! (weak laugh) Burn on her.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26758","Steve","Come on, man. Don't be that Blitz.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26759","Barney","I'm not any Blitz! You're The Blitz! You're all The Blitz! I slept with that cute Indian girl who cuts my hair!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26760","Robin","What does that have to do with anything?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26761","Barney","Nothing! I just forgot to brag about it before!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26762","Ted","Guys, despite the wit and wisdom of Wang Guy, Zoey and I are never going to be friends. We're just here for her oven and that's it.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26763","Ted","Oh, my God!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26764","Zoey","Did you do that on purpose?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26765","Ted","What? No. It was an accident.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26766","Zoey","Oh, yeah. Well, like this is.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26767","Ted","Oh, great. Real mature.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26768","Zoey","Yeah, well, you started it.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26769","Lily","Just stop it! God, can't you two just stop fighting for one day? Like, when the Roadrunner and the Coyote clocked out and had a beer together? Or-Or-Or Tom and Jerry shared a cup of coffee.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26770","Ted","Lily, those are cartoon characters, and I'm pretty sure you're making up episodes. And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26771","Zoey","Oh, get out. All of you, out!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26772","Lily","But it's Thanksgiving.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26773","Steve","And I'm a part of it.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26774","Zoey","Out!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26775","Marshall","Wait... Where's Barney?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26776","Barney","Hey, guys, the most amazing thing just happened to me in that other roo... Aw, man.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26777","Lily","I don't get it. Why'd she just kick us out like that?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26778","Ted from 2030","And then the cab driver said the last thing any of us wanted to hear.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26779","Driver","Where to?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26780","Ted","I guess we're going home.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26781","Driver","Yeah. I don't know where that is.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26782","Ted","Lily, where'd you get that?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26783","Lily","Oh. When Zoey booted us, it made me want to steal something of hers again. Apartment full of designer labels, and what do I grab? ""Happy Turkey Day, Hannah. Love, Zoey."" I wonder who Hannah is.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26784","Zoey","Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone, anyway. Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26785","Ted","And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26786","Zoey","Get out! All of you, out!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26787","Ted","We have to go back to Zoey's.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26788","Driver","You gotta throw me some addresses, buddy.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26789","Zoey","Oh, God. What are you doing here?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26790","Ted","Barney let us in.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26791","Zoey","Barney was here? I was walking around half-naked.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26792","Barney","Aw, man! Wait. Which half?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26793","Ted","Look, I'm sorry your stepdaughter didn't want to spend Thanksgiving with you.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26794","Zoey","How do you know that?","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26795","Ted","I just do. It must be tough.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26796","Zoey","It was the first Thanksgiving Hannah agreed to spend with me, and then at the last minute she changed her mind. She hates my guts.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26797","Ted","I get that. Uh, you should hang on to this. You can give it to her next year.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26798","Zoey","Yeah... Right. Next year.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26799","Ted","Hey, you never know. People don't stay enemies forever.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26800","Ted from 2030","And that's the story of how Zoey and I became friends.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26801","Everyone","Cheers.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26802","Zoey","Before we eat, we should take a group picture and send it to Wang Guy.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26803","Marshall","Ooh. Oh. Great idea. All right. Okay. Here we go. One, two, three.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26804","Zoey","Ted, that is the best-looking turturkeykey I have ever seen.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26805","Ted","Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes as good as it looks.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26806","Ted from 2030","It didn't. It tasted wrong.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26807","Steve","Oops. We forgot to light the candles.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26808","Ted from 2030","And just as Barney looked away, it happened.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26809","Everyone","The Gentleman!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26810","Barney","What happened? I saw it!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26811","Steve","Aw, come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad. Aw, man. Oh, go ahead. I forgot my jacket.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26812","Woman","Oh, hold the door!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26813","Barney","Thank you, God!","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26814","Mysterious voice","Blitz.","06","10","Blitzgiving"
"26815","Ted from 2030","Kids, in the winter of 2010, we had a new addition to our little group... Zoey. Zoey was married to... The Captain.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26816","Captain","Boys! Great to see you! Looking smart. Have a wonderful time tonight, okay?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26817","Marshall","Okay. That man is terrifying.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26818","Barney","Everything he said was nice, but I am profoundly scared.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26819","Ted","Keep smiling. He can still see us.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26820","Ted from 2030","There was just something about him. We couldn't put our finger on it until...","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26821","Marshall","I figured it out! I know what's so creepy about The Captain.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26822","Robin","Okay.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26823","Marshall","Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey.Observe. The bottom half of his face... is smiling. He seems happy. Seems like a nice guy. (everyone is murmuring happily) But the top half of his face...wants to murder you! Cheerful. Wants to murder you. No. Cheerful. Wants to murder you. Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question. Captain, what do you think of ice cream? Oh, he loves it!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26824","Barney","Captain, what do you think of rainy days?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26825","Marshall","Whoa, he hates them.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26826","Robin","Captain, quick question  How do you feel about the Jonas Brothers? Ooh.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26827","Ted","Ooh. What-What is that?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26828","Robin and Lily","I don't get it.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26829","Marshall","He hates that he loves them.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26830","Ted","Great. Okay. Hey, guys, Zoey just told me about this great Frank Lloyd Wright retrospective tonight. Who's in?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26831","Lily","Sorry, I'm, uh, I... I- I don't know, washing my hair.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26832","Marshall","Running the water.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26833","Robin","Holding the towel.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26834","Barney","And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited meto the big hair washing party.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26835","Ted","All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26836","Lily","Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one...","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26837","Barney","Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26838","Lily","Rule number one  don't go anywhere that has candles.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26839","Marshall","Excuse me, Captain, how do you feel about Ted and Zoey having an intimate chat by candlelight? It'll be the last dinner they ever have.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26840","Lily","Rule number two  No sharing food. In fact, anything involving saliva is off-limits. Toothbrushes, thermometers, lipstick.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26841","Ted","Well, if I can't share her lipstick,there's really no pointin even going.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26842","Lily","And the most important rule of all...","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26843","Barney","Lubricant is public property. (Robin groans)","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26844","Marshall","Please.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26845","Lily","No lying to the spouse about anything you do.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26846","Ted","Why would anyone lie? Look, Zoey and I are just friends. If there was anything more than that, I wouldn't hang out with her.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26847","Marshall","Lily's right, Ted. Once you're married, it's very hard to be friends with a single person of the opposite s*x.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26848","Robin","Yeah. Unless you're old friends, which is why I can hang out with Marshall whenever I want. Right, Marsh Madness?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26849","Marshall","No doubt, Robo Cop.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26850","Lily","You two never hang out alone. You just made up those nicknames right now.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26851","Marshall","I guess it's true. You and I never really hang out alone.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26852","Robin","Well, let's. Let's have dinner together, just the two of us.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26853","Lily","Oh! Sweet. No candles.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26854","Barney","Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. Want to hang?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26855","Ted from 2030","And then Lily said something to Barney that insulted every fiber of his being.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26856","Lily","Nah.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26857","Ted from 2030","Wait. No. It had to be more than just, ""Nah."" Oh, I think she said...","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26858","Lily","You're a big... stupid octopus head!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26859","Ted from 2030","No, that doesn't make sense. Okay, hang on. What did she say? She said, um, uh... To be honest kids, I'm having a little trouble remembering exactly what their fight was about. Hey, it was 20 years ago! I'll remember. Anyway, the next night...","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26860","Ted","Well, Lily, you were right. Something weird happened with Zoey last night.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26861","Zoey","Oh, that's the Captain. Yes, I call my husband The Captain, but that is the only concession I make to his seafaring ways. Hang on. Ahoy. I'm just out with friends.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26862","Ted","Friends. Plural. Like-Like there was more than one of me.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26863","Lily","Ew! Ew! She lied to her husband? Uh-oh. So, what did you do?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26864","Ted","Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say you were out with friends?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26865","Zoey","Yeah. The Captain's on his way home from Milan. He can get a little jealous sometimes, so I didn't want to make him worry. Is that okay?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26866","Ted","It's totally okay.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26867","Lily","It's not okay! I didn't really think it was okay! Pur-leez! You lie to your husband all the time. ""Uh, uh, that shirt looks great on you""""I love your mom""""I never fantasize about Barney when we're doing it"""" Sound familiar, Pinocchio?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26868","Marshall","What's wrong with this shirt?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26869","Ted","Lily, ruling. Do I have to stop hanging out with Zoey?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26870","Lily","No, you just need to spend time with her and The Captain together. If you're friends with the both of them, then there's not a problem.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26871","Ted","Actually, I do have a standing invitation from The Captain to go for a ride with them on his boat.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26872","Lily","Great. So go make nice with Captain Creepy, and problem solved.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26873","Ted from 2030","The next night, Marshall and Robin went to dinner, just the two of them. Now historically, they had three solid conversation topics  cold weather...","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26874","Robin","December chill... so great.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26875","Marshall","Totally.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26876","Ted from 2030","...sports...","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26877","Marshall","Did you catch the game last night?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26878","Robin","Yeah. Nail-biter.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26879","Ted from 2030","...and cold weather sports.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26880","Marshall","You know what's fun? Is cold weather sports.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26881","Robin","They are fun.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26882","Ted from 2030","They blew through them all in the first 16 seconds.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26883","Robin","Man, this is awkward.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26884","Marshall","She's giving me nothing! He's just staring at me! She's just staring at me! It's making me nervous. Great, now my left eye is twitching.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26885","Robin","Marshall, it's cool. She doesn't see it. What the hell's going on with his eye? Am I supposed to not talk about that? Great, now my right eye is doing it.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26886","Waiter","Can I get you two some drinks?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26887","Marshall","Lots of drinks.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26888","Robin","Oh, so many drinks.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26889","Ted from 2030","That same night, Barney and Lily were still fighting about, um... something. Or was it that other thing?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26890","Lily","Barney.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26891","Barney","Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for... something, and for that other thing.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26892","Lily","Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But let's be honest. You've been super sensitive lately.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26893","Barney, crying","No, I haven't! God, how can you say that?!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26894","Lily","Watch out!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26895","Ted from 2030","Wait. They were on the street.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26896","Lily","Watch out!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26897","Barney","Oh! Wow. Thanks, Lily. You saved me. You saved us. Look, I know you didn't mean whatever it was you said that made me so mad.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26898","Lily","I think I probably didn't.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26899","Ted from 2030","And just like that, the fight was over. You know, kids, friendship is funny sometimes.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26900","Lily","Wait. I still can't resist getting one last shot in.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26901","Ted from 2030","Like I said, the fight was just getting started.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26902","Ted","Hi, Captain. The Captain. Captain.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26903","Captain","Ahoy, Ted! Excellent to see you.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26904","Ted","Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26905","Captain","Well, I'm afraid she's feeling a little under the weather. Looks like it's just you, me and six hours in frigid international waters.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26906","Ted","Or we could stay on dry land, hang out with some... witnesses.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26907","Captain","You're a hoot. I've been looking forward to this. For a very long time. Well, anchors aweigh!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26908","Ted from 2030","Kids, here's one thing I do remember. I was pretty sure I was going to die that night.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26909","Robin","You know, I had this really boring poetry class in college.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26910","Marshall","You were just thinking that this dinner is really boring. That's what made you think of your boring class in college.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26911","Robin","What?! What? No! No! No, no, no. Marshall, no. No. I... I just saw that board of specials, and I thought, you know what sucks? Being bored. Which I am not. So that clears that... right up.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26912","Marshall","Robin, I'm an attorney.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26913","Robin","Fine. This night's a little awkward.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26914","Marshall","I guess it's 'cause we never hang out alone together.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26915","Robin","Why is that?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26916","Marshall","It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26917","Marshall","Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26918","Barney","So, who's the eye broccoli?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26919","Marshall","Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26920","Barney","Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26921","Marshall","I don't think that's gonna be a problem.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26922","Barney","Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26923","Marshall","I'm sorry. Myth?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26924","Barney","It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like... beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26925","Marshall","And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually...","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26926","Barney","D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26927","Marshall","Did we bet on this?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26928","Barney","Let's say yes.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26929","Robin","And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26930","Marshall","As Lily's best friend, you are the last person on the planet o's allowed to turn into a mermaid.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26931","Robin","Wait, does that mean that I'm a manatee right now?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26932","Marshall","Big-time manatee.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26933","Robin","What were those sailors thinking?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26934","Marshall","Huh. I don't know. Being out at sea can do crazy things to a man.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26935","Captain","Vast, the sea. Deep. Endless. Going around for miles. You could scream and scream, and not a soul would hear you. Listen to this. (screams) Help! Somebody help me! I'm trapped on a boat with a madman! Help! See? Nothing.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26936","Ted","He's gonna kill me. Okay, calm down, Teddy. He's not jealous. He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26937","Captain","So, Ted, I noticed you've been spending a lot of time with Zoey.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26938","Ted from 2030","Okay, back to Barney and Lily and whatever the hell they were fighting about.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26939","Lily","Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26940","Barney","What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26941","Ted from 2030","Wait. Barney's not a woman. That's right... Barney wasn't hurt by Lily, Lily was hurt by Barney.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26942","Lily","Want to hang?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26943","Barney","Nah. Watch out!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26944","Lily","Wow... thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26945","Lily","If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26946","Ted from 2030","Okay, now I'm on track. The rest of this story should make perfect sense.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26947","Barney","Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26948","Lily","You're a jerk.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26949","Ted from 2030","Okay, that makes no sense. Kids, I'm officially admitting defeat. I will never remember this story. I'm sorry for wasting your time.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26950","Captain","Ted, let me show you my harpoon collection.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26951","Ted","Just gonna make a quick call. Hey, silly question. What are our exact nautical coordinates?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26952","Captain","How now? Oh, bother. (sighs) Well... she's a goner. By now, the icy tide has already dropped its core temperature to near freezing. And down it goes. Now it's at 50 meters. Complete crushing blackness. 100 meters. The pressure is so intense, the keys are popping right out of its head.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26953","Ted","Head?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26954","Captain","200 meters. No one will ever find its mangled remains, save for the crustacea that feed off its lifeless husk. Can you hear me now? No. Because you're on the bottom of the sea.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26955","Ted","Well, I got a big morning, so... Dry cleaners, bank, you know, so...","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26956","Captain","Ted, it's time. I have something for you. Wait here.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26957","Ted","Okay, you got to swim for it, Mosby. Man versus sea. You can do this. You didn't get a ""Good Effort"" ribbon from the Shaker Heights JCC Swim Camp because you don't have what it takes.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26958","Captain","Found it. Zoey told me you're a scotch drinker. I bought this special for tonight.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26959","Ted from 2030","And just as I started to realize that maybe I wasn't in danger after all, we hit a bump.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26960","Captain","Ted?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26961","Robin","you're afraid that if you spend too much time alone with me, I'll turn into a mermaid?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26962","Marshall","Yes. I mean, sure, right now, you're bald and leathery ancovered in a thick layer of blubber...","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26963","Robin","Am I blushing or...?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26964","Marshall","...but at some point, my stupid male brain will transform you into a foxy fish-babe singin' ""Part of Your World"" to my pants.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26965","Robin","Okay, even if that happens, is there any way to un-mermaid me?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26966","Marshall","I asked Barney the same thing.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26967","Barney","Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26968","Marshall","Death?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26969","Barney","Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City... where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26970","Robin","Pregnancy?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26971","Marshall","Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant, she becomes a manatee again. Never thought I'd say that sentence.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26972","Ted from 2030","Wait! That's it! That's what Barney and Lily were fighting about! The Mermaid Theory! But their argument didn't happen at the same time as all this other stuff. I'm literally in the wrong year! It happened much, much later when Lily was... pregnant.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26973","Barney","Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26974","Liy","Nah. Whenever we're alone, you spend the whole time undressing me with your eyes. You even take off my shoes.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26975","Barney","High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26976","Lily","Well, you're a big... stupid octopus face!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26977","Ted from 2030","That was it! I remember now!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26978","Lily","Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman ""fat"" right to her face!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26979","Barney","I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26980","Lily","Oh... You're a jerk.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26981","Barney","Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26982","Lily","What's that?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26983","Barney","Breast-feeding. Hot.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26984","Lily","Really?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26985","Barney","Really. When those things swell up to three times their normal size... so do I.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26986","Lily","That's so sweet!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26987","Ted from 2030","See kids? Told you I'd get it!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26988","Ted","Okay, now we're even!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26989","Ted from 2030","Yeah, that's the ending to a whole other story. We'll get there.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26990","Captain","So you really thought I was gonna kill you?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26991","Ted","Well... ish.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26992","Captain","Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous. If I wanted to kill you, I'd invite you to my hunting lodge. It's far more remote, and I wouldn't have to worry about you turning up in some nosy fisherman's net.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26993","Ted","See? It's stuff like that. Why-why do you talk that way?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26994","Captain","Oh, I'm just jesting for sport. See, sometimes I don't bond as well with Zoey's younger friends. But I know she really likes you. I was hoping that maybe we could be buddies.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26995","Ted","We can. We can be buddies. Just not on a boat.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26996","Captain","Fair enough. The hunting lodge it is.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26997","Robin, slurring","You know, once we stopped trying to have a conversation and just focused on the drinking... I had fun.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26998","Marshall","Yeah, me, too.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"26999","Ted from 2030","And then a terrible thing happened. Marshall's beer goggles kicked in and his very drunk mind started to see...","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27000","Marshall","No... No, no! No! No, don't turn!","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27001","Robin","Uh-oh. I don't feel so good. (She vomits) Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry! Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27002","Marshall","I really do.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27003","Ted from 2030","And from that moment on Marshall never worried about Robin becoming a mermaid again, and the two of them were closer than ever.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27004","Zoey","Hey, Ted.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27005","Ted","Hey. You feeling better?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27006","Zoey","I have a confession to make. I wasn't really sick.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27007","Ted","You weren't?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27008","Zoey","I'm sorry. I was just feeling guilty that I lied to The Captain and... I don't know, I just thought it would be good if you two spent some time together.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27009","Ted","I get it. And you were right. He's a nice guy. I mean, he can be a little scary.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27010","Zoey","Yeah, he gets a little murder-y when he's nervous.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27011","Ted","Yeah, he's a creepy dude. But I like him. And I just want to make sure you and I hanging out doesn't, you know, cross any lines.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27012","Zoey","Me, too.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27013","Ted","I mean, if either one of us had even the slightest hint of feelings for the other, we shouldn't hang out. You don't, do you?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27014","Zoey","No. Do you?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27015","Ted","No.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27016","Sailor #1","Still no sign of land.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27017","Sailor #2","It's been 243 days since we've seen another living soul. What are you looking at?","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27018","Sailor #1","Dude, we need to find land.","06","11","The Mermaid Theory"
"27019","Ted from 2030","In December of 2010, my friends and I decided to go see It's a Wonderful Life on the big screen. It seemed like something we all needed. After all, it had been a crazy couple of days. It all started...","06","12","False Positive"
"27020","Ted from 2030","With a pregnancy test.","06","12","False Positive"
"27021","Marshall","This is taking forever. Are you sure you did it right?","06","12","False Positive"
"27022","Lily","Is there a wrong way to pee on a stick?","06","12","False Positive"
"27023","Marshall","Hey, can I ask you a question that's plagued me for years? Can girls aim?","06","12","False Positive"
"27024","Lily","Um, can boys aim? 'Cause it seems to me like I'm taking a mop to that bathroom floor every two days.","06","12","False Positive"
"27025","Marshall","Okay, you're the one who put the Far Side calendar up over the toilet. You know I laugh with my whole body.","06","12","False Positive"
"27026","Lily","It's been two minutes.","06","12","False Positive"
"27027","Marshall & Lily","One, two, three.","06","12","False Positive"
"27028","Lily","It's positive.","06","12","False Positive"
"27029","Marshall","It's positive? It's positive.","06","12","False Positive"
"27030","Lily","I'm pregnant.","06","12","False Positive"
"27031","Robin","What?!","06","12","False Positive"
"27032","Barney","I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry. Force of habit. Congratulations!","06","12","False Positive"
"27033","Robin","To Lily and Marshall.","06","12","False Positive"
"27034","Marshall","Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier. Can't imagine anything bringing me down right now.","06","12","False Positive"
"27035","Doctor","You're not pregnant.","06","12","False Positive"
"27036","Marshall","Well, that did it.","06","12","False Positive"
"27037","Ted from 2030","Kids, this is the story of the 36 hours we all thought Lily was pregnant, and how it caused each of us to reexamine our own lives. Because while this was happening...","06","12","False Positive"
"27038","Marshall","Are you sure you did it right?","06","12","False Positive"
"27039","Ted from 2030","...I was on the phone with Punchy, my best friend from high school, who had recently asked me to be his best man.","06","12","False Positive"
"27040","Ted","Hey, Punchy, I've given this some serious thought. I think I know how we can crush these floral arrangements.","06","12","False Positive"
"27041","Punchy","Ah, here it comes. Hit me up, Schmos!","06","12","False Positive"
"27042","Ted","Peonies, lavender blossoms with a halo of baby's breath for an ambiance of springtime rejuvenation.","06","12","False Positive"
"27043","Punchy","That's exactly the accent of whimsy this celebration of love needs!","06","12","False Positive"
"27044","Ted","It's gonna be a magical day. (Ted hangs up) I know what you're thinking. I wish I was a dude.","06","12","False Positive"
"27045","Robin","I do wish you were a dude.","06","12","False Positive"
"27046","Ted","Because if I was a dude, I could have Ted Mosby as my best man.","06","12","False Positive"
"27047","Robin","No, and here's why.,Ted, the best man's job is not to crush the floral arrangements. It's to get the groom down the aisle, because, no matter who he is, he will freak out. And I just don't think you have what it takes to get that get that soldier to pick up his rifle and charge up the hill.","06","12","False Positive"
"27048","Ted","Uh, are you forgetting I've done this before? I was Marshall's best man.","06","12","False Positive"
"27049","Robin","And how did that go again? Oh for one.","06","12","False Positive"
"27050","Ted","Oh, come on. That wasn't my fault. And need I remind you, I gave a beautiful toast.","06","12","False Positive"
"27051","Robin","Ted. (Both yelling) Oh, do you take one to be your lawfully wedded wife? Oh, God, I'm freaking out. Why did I chose Ted to be my best man?","06","12","False Positive"
"27052","Ted","Uh, yeah. It's hard to take criticism from someone who just recorded seven episodes of Million Dollar Heads or Tails.","06","12","False Positive"
"27053","Ted from 2030","Kids, Million Dollar Heads or Tails was an extremely popular show with an extremely simple premise.","06","12","False Positive"
"27054","Animator","All right, your practice flip came up tails... But our Vegas oddsmaker tells us that the next toss is still just 50-50. And so, Jordan, for one million dollars......Heads... or tails? (Audience shouting suggestions)","06","12","False Positive"
"27055","Jordan","What was the year of the coin again?","06","12","False Positive"
"27056","Ted","Why this sudden obsession with Heads or Tails?","06","12","False Positive"
"27057","Robin","Well, it turns out that Heads or Tails has a job opening.","06","12","False Positive"
"27058","Jordin","Ta... heads.","06","12","False Positive"
"27059","Animator","Marni, flip that coin.","06","12","False Positive"
"27060","Robin","So now, because of that incident, Heads or Tails is looking for a new currency rotation specialist.","06","12","False Positive"
"27061","Ted","You mean coin flip bimbo?","06","12","False Positive"
"27062","Robin","They're not bimbos!","06","12","False Positive"
"27063","Ted","You auditioned, didn't you?","06","12","False Positive"
"27064","Ted","You're the new coin flip bimbo?","06","12","False Positive"
"27065","Robin","Currency rotation specialist.","06","12","False Positive"
"27066","Ted","Robin, you better check yourself before you trebek yourself. You're a journalist! What is the matter with you?","06","12","False Positive"
"27067","Robin","Well, it's a national audience! I get to wear shiny dresses!","06","12","False Positive"
"27068","Ted","Robin, have you forgotten about your New Year's resolution?","06","12","False Positive"
"27069","Robin","I am never drinking again.","06","12","False Positive"
"27070","Ted","No, before that.","06","12","False Positive"
"27071","Robin, slurring","I am gonna finish this whole bottle tonight.","06","12","False Positive"
"27072","Ted","Before that, too.","06","12","False Positive"
"27073","Robin","I moved here to work for a big-time cable news channel like World Wide News. Mm-hmm. Well, by this time next year, I will be wearing a World Wide News I.D. badge around my neck. And to show you that I'm serious, this is my first and only drink of the night. Okay. Okay? Oh, damn, that's smooth.","06","12","False Positive"
"27074","Ted","I thought you finally got that interview at World Wide News.","06","12","False Positive"
"27075","Robin","Well, I did, but they only offered me a boring, low-paid, off-camera research job.","06","12","False Positive"
"27076","Ted","Which could be a stepping stone to bigger things in your career.","06","12","False Positive"
"27077","Robin","Well, so could Heads or Tails. (snorts) The first currency rotation specialist went on to be a semi-finalist on The Bachelor, and then, she lost, like, a hundred pounds on The Biggest Loser, and now she's totally winning Celebrity Rehab.","06","12","False Positive"
"27078","Ted from 2030","It seemed like there was no changing Robin's mind. But what we didn't know, in that moment, was that our world was about to be turned upside down.","06","12","False Positive"
"27079","Lily","I'm pregnant.","06","12","False Positive"
"27080","Robin","What?!","06","12","False Positive"
"27081","Ted from 2030","Now, kids, when your friends have great news, you're happy for them... For, like, a millisecond. And then you start thinking about yourself.","06","12","False Positive"
"27082","Robin","Oh, my God! They're really having a baby. What am I doing with my life? Starting Monday, I'm a currency rotation spe... Oh, who am I kidding? I'm a coin flip bimbo, and I'm still single. Okay, let's not go there, Scherbatsky. That's a whole other thing. I've got to take that World Wide News job.","06","12","False Positive"
"27083","Ted from 2030","And so, the next night, we had two things to celebrate.","06","12","False Positive"
"27084","Robin","Well, you are looking at the new associate researcher at World Wide News.","06","12","False Positive"
"27085","Marshall","Oh, my gosh. That's amazing news.","06","12","False Positive"
"27086","Ted","What changed your mind?","06","12","False Positive"
"27087","Robin","Marshall and Lily. I just realized that I am about to have a little niece who looks up to me. And I don't want to be sad aunt Robin, the aging coin flip bimbo who gives her the creeps. I want to be cool aunt Robin, the respected journalist... (quietly) Who gives her beer.","06","12","False Positive"
"27088","Lily","What?","06","12","False Positive"
"27089","Robin","What? Oh. I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall.","06","12","False Positive"
"27090","Marshall","Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier.","06","12","False Positive"
"27091","Ted from 2030","So the next day Robin called Heads or Tails to respectfully decline.","06","12","False Positive"
"27092","Robin","Hi, Mr. Trebek. This is Robin Scherbatsky.","06","12","False Positive"
"27093","Ted from 2030","But at that moment...","06","12","False Positive"
"27094","Doctor","You're not pregnant.","06","12","False Positive"
"27095","Robin","As honored as I am by the offer, um... (Phone chirps) Oh, my God. They're not having a baby. What am I getting all up in my head about? That research job sounds hard. And I'm pretty. I'm really, really pretty.","06","12","False Positive"
"27096","Robin","You are looking at the new coin flip bimbo.","06","12","False Positive"
"27097","Ted","You took the Heads or tails job?","06","12","False Positive"
"27098","Robin","Yeah.","06","12","False Positive"
"27099","Ted","What about World Wide News, your I.D. badge? You made a New Year's resolution.","06","12","False Positive"
"27100","Robin","Okay, I also said I would never make out with a garbage man. Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. What's with the gingerbread house?","06","12","False Positive"
"27101","Ted","We're seeing a Christmas movie. It's a Christmas-themed movie snack.","06","12","False Positive"

"27122","Barney","What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!","06","12","False Positive"
"27123","Barney","Huh. Marshall and Lily are doing something meaningful. And it's making me less happy about this bonus. And I'm still single. At least I got that going for me. So why do I still feel outside of awesome looking in? What am I doing with my life?","06","12","False Positive"
"27124","Marshall","we've never been happier. can't imagine bringing e down right now.","06","12","False Positive"

"27276","Marshall","Yes, I know, we made our little deal with the universe, but...","06","13","Bad News"
"27277","Lily","No, we've made a binding covenant with the universe. We said we weren't going to try to have kids until we saw Barney's doppelganger. Oh, this is bad news. This is like a black cat walked through my uterus. Okay, that's it. I am going back to Dr. Stangel and getting thoroughly checked out.","06","13","Bad News"
"27278","Barney","Or... or cost-saving alternative  you could get checked out by someone who looks just like him. I'm gonna go scrub up. I'll meet you in stall three.","06","13","Bad News"

"27288","Stangel","He checks out. I really don't have time for this.","06","13","Bad News"
"27289","Marshall","No, Barney... Doctor, wait, please, it's... Can you just give us a couple minutes? I... Lily, how can I convince you that this is not Barney?","06","13","Bad News"
"27290","Barney","Wow, it is like looking into a poorly dressed mirror.","06","13","Bad News"

"27292","Lily","Okay. Convinced.","06","13","Bad News"
"27293","Stangel","Great. All right, you're a little low on the table. Please scoot up.","06","13","Bad News"

"27295","Marshall","Baby, you just saw Barney.","06","13","Bad News"

"27329","Lily","Okay, now you're being ridiculous. An hour ago, you didn't even think there was a problem.","06","13","Bad News"
"27330","Marshall","Well, I was just putting on a brave face. Okay, think about it  we've had unprotected s*x 203 times in the past four months. Obviously I'm the problem.","06","13","Bad News"
"27331","Barney","Problem?! You can't get a girl pregnant. That's the dream. I'd give my firstborn to not be able to have children.","06","13","Bad News"

"27350","Barney","Exactly! Or when your... I don't know... friend invites you to a laser tag tournament, you don't fight it. You just strap on the vinyl holster and race into that abandoned JCPenney guns a-blazin'. I'm just agreeing with Ted.","06","13","Bad News"

"27372","Sandy","A few?","06","13","Bad News"

"27674","Robin","There is one thing that's been going on. Uh, it's about Ted... and Zoey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27675","Ted from 2030","Kids, remember. Zoey had tried to save an old building from being torn down and replaced by a new building that I'd been hired to design. And yet somehow, despite this, we had all managed to become friends. Which brings us to the night Aunt Robin decided to cook dinner.","06","15","Oh Honey"

"27677","Ted","It's okay. We got hot dogs.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27678","Lily","Yeah, and it's not like you can screw up a hot dog. Oh, God. This is so good. I'm gonna finish it in the bathroom.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27679","Zoey","Could someone pass the ketchup?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27680","Barney","I hope I can pass this hot dog.","06","15","Oh Honey"

"27692","Robin","Oh, it's good. You see, after that night, none of us heard from Zoey for a while.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27693","Robin","Finally, Ted called her up.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27694","Zoey","Hello.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27695","Ted","So are we ever gonna see you again? Because, if I recall correctly, you owe me a date with your hot cousin.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27696","Zoey","You still want to do that?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27697","Ted","Yes. And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27698","Zoey","Don't worry, Ted, she's cute.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27699","Barney, coughing","""Cute"" means ""fat""""","06","15","Oh Honey"

"27705","Zoey","Hey. Ted, this is my cousin...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27706","Ted from 2030","Kids, to be honest, I don't quite remember this girl's name. None of us do, because as this story has been told and retold, we've always just referred to her as...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27707","Honey","Honey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27708","Ted","Hi, Honey, I'm Ted.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27709","Ted from 2030","And here's why...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27710","Robin","She is a lovely person... warm, intelligent, just kind of gullible. It's like, every word out of her mouth makes you want to be like, ""Oh, honey.""","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27711","Marshall","Interesting. Show your work.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27712","Honey","My apartment building is so safe. My landlord... he even installed a security camera in my shower.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27713","Marshall","Oh, honey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27714","Honey","Maybe I should feel weird about giving a stranger my Social Security number, but the guy's a Nigerian prince.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27715","Marshall","Oh, honey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27716","Honey","I just had a great TV audition. Behind the KFC where the executive producer works on the weekends.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27717","Marshall","Oh, honey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27718","Honey","Long story short, I'm going to be on Lost.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27719","Marshall","Oh, honey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27720","Robin","I know. You just want to wrap her up in a blanket and give her a cup of tea. She's, like, this little lost lamb who needs to be protected from the wolves. Speaking of whom...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27721","Honey","Yeah, I always get those e- mails from Michelle Obama and sometimes Obama himself.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27722","Barney","Oh, honey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27723","Robin","So the night went on, and eventually everyone went home, except for Ted and Honey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27724","Honey","Wow, an architect. How fascinating.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27725","Barney","Why do they call 'em coasters?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27726","Robin","And Barney.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27727","Honey","Okay, time to go home.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27728","Barney","Ted, a word. God, I hate these situations. What are we gonna do about this?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27729","Ted","What are you talking about?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27730","Barney","Come on, Ted, it's obvious. Honey's vibing on me.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27731","Ted","What?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27732","Barney","It's called body language. Remember when she was touching your arm and leaning in real close?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27733","Ted","Mm-hmm.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27734","Barney","Well, while that was happening, the straw in her drink was pointed right at me. I mean... that's as clear as a signal gets, so... I'm so sorry, man.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27735","Ted","You're right. She's all yours, buddy. I'd say hump her brains out, but someone obviously already has.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27736","Robin","Good for you. Ted Mosby does not take advantage of poor, helpless honeys.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27737","Ted","Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.","06","15","Oh Honey"

"27749","Judy","Sorry.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27750","Marshall","Ted's in love with Zoey? But, but she's married. That boy needs an intervention.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27751","Robin","Funny you should say that.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27752","Barney","Does anyone know why we're here?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27753","Lily","Yeah, who called this intervention?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27754","Ted","I did. It's for me. This is about the coffee breath.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27755","Lily","Finally.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27756","Robin","Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27757","Barney","Guys, just let the man explain how it's all about his wearing a lady's watch.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27758","Ted","It's because I'm in love with Zoey, and she's married, so it needs to stop. And... intervene.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27759","Lily","Are you sure it's love?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27760","Ted","Remember the ketchup bottle? She wasn't the one who dropped it. When she reached for it, our fingers touched, and...(glass shatters) I knew, right in that moment, this isn't friendship. This is love.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27761","Marshall","Marcus! This is a private conversation! So what'd the wuss do next?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27762","Ted","This is love. And this was my grandmother's watch. Anyway, now I have only one course of action in front of me  I have to end my friendship with Zoey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27763","Robin","Isn't that a little harsh?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27764","Lily","Harsh? Robin, a single guy and a married woman cannot be friends if one's in love with the other.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27765","Robin","Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now, too. It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her. She'll always be around.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27766","Ted","Then what am I supposed to do?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27767","Robin","Okay, just shut it down. Okay, just ignore your feelings. If-If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self. Look, I like Zoey. Without her, my dinner party wouldn't have been such a success. So those feelings of yours... shut 'em down.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27768","Ted","Fine. I'll shut 'em down.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27769","Lily","And seriously, mouthwash after coffee.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27770","Marshall","Oh, um, that's my other line. It's not a number I recognize.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27771","Robin","So don't answer it.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27772","Marshall","Yeah.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27773","Robin, with a Minnesotan accent","Oh, my God, you are so Minnesota. You can't not answer the phone because it would be rude.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27774","Marshall","Well, it would be. Good-bye. Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27775","Barney","Hey, Marshall.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27776","Marshall","Barney. W- What number is this?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27777","Barney","I'm up on burners, playa. Too many crazies had my old number, so now I'm all about disposable cell phones. I'll use one for a while, have my fun, then dump it and get a new one. And then I'll do the same with my phone.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27778","Marshall","Hey, uh, so Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27779","Barney","Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story. I'll tell you that story.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27780","Honey","Hey, Zoey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27781","Zoey","Ted, this is my cousin...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27782","Honey","Honey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27783","Marshall","Uh... Robin's version was...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27784","Barney","That is exactly how it happened. So Ted did his best to impress her, but as per yoozh, he bored the pants very much on her.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27785","Ted","Blah, blah, blah, I'm an architect. Blah, blah, blah, I don't wear suits. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27786","Honey","Wow, an architect. How fascinating.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27787","Ted","Blah, blah, blah, blah. Rambling architecture anecdote. Blah, blah, something about a bridge. Blah, blah, blah...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27788","Honey, whispering","Straw.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27789","Barney, whispering","Coaster.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27790","Honey","Okay, time to go home.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27791","Barney","Anyway, I get Honey back to her place.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27792","Barney","Who's your daddy?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27793","Marshall","Okay, can we skip this part, please?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27794","Barney","Sure, I'll just summarize it. (imitating squeaky bedsprings)","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27795","Marshall","Okay, that's been going on a while.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27796","Barney","Only way I know how. Any-who, next day, I'm going into work. I run into Zoey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27797","Barney","Hey, Zoey. That cousin of yours... Honey... yowsa! I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27798","Zoey","Thanks.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27799","Barney","Yeah, we had a great time last night. And then just hand stuff in the morning, so...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27800","Zoey","Wait, she didn't go home with Ted?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27801","Barney","Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize... (imitating squeaky bedsprings)","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27802","Barney","She hugged me. What was that all about?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27803","Marcus","Zoey's in love with Ted.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27804","Marshall","Marcus!","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27805","Marcus","Wait, hear me out, Marshall. Zoey's in love with Ted, but she's married, so she tried to push him away by setting him up with her cousin instead. But seeing Ted and Honey hit it off was more than her gentle heart could bear, so Zoey left early, pricked by love's fickle thorn. But then, the next morning, upon learning that Ted had not tasted of Honey's sweet nectar, her joy burst forth like a blossoming flower in spring.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27806","Marshall","Wow. Zoey's in love with Ted.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27807","Marcus","Oh, Marshall, I stopped by that new doughnut shop Hertz Donuts. Would you like a Hertz Donut?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27808","Marshall","Sure. Hey, where's the...? No! Aah!","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27809","Marcus","Hurts, don't it? I can't believe you fell for that, bro.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27810","Marshall","So Ted's in love with Zoey and Zoey's in love with Ted? Well, that-that's not going to work. I got to call Ted.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27811","Ted","Hello.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27812","Marshall","Listen, Ted, um, I got to tell you something about Zoey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27813","Ted","Yeah, yeah. I need to tell you something about Zoey, too.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27814","Zoey","Hey. I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd take you up on that beer you're about to offer me.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27815","Ted","Can I get you a beer?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27816","Zoey","Oh, Ted, I'm so busy. But I guess I got time for one. Lead the way.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27817","Ted, laughing","Oh, my God.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27818","Zoey","What?! Fridge full of ketchup? How? How, I ask you? What?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27819","Ted","Listen, Zoey, I, um... I need to tell you something. Um...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27820","Judy","Marshall, I'm going to Byerly's. You want anything?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27821","Marshall","Mom! Get off the phone!","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27822","Marcus","Could you get some more Bugles, please?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27823","Judy","Of course, dear.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27824","Marshall","Marcus, hang up! Both of you, hang up! And we need ice cream. Go on.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27825","Ted","I, uh... I can't be friends with you anymore. And this may seem strange, but... you can't ask me why.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27826","Zoey","Wow. Okay.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27827","Ted","And that was it. No more Zoey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27828","Marshall","Oh. Hey, buddy, that's Lily. I should take that. But, uh, you're a good guy, Ted. Hey, baby.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27829","Lily","We hate Ted now. Get on board or the sexting stops.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27830","Marshall","Ted's a son of a bitch! (cell phone chirps) Oh, nice. But, hey, um, baby, go easy on Ted, okay? He just, he just ended things with Zoey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27831","Lily","Oh, I know. But did he tell you the whole story?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27832","Ted","I, uh, I can't be friends with you anymore. And you can't ask me why.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27833","Zoey","Why?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27834","Ted","Lily hates you.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27835","Zoey","You hate me?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27836","Lily","That's crazy. I don't hate you.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27837","Zoey","Well, I know that's not true, Lily. Ted told me everything.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27838","Lily","He... Oh, really? And-And what did Ted say, exactly?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27839","Ted","Lily hates you. She hates you so much it's hard to be around you. So we can't be friends.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27840","Lily","Oh, he... Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay, well, I- I guess there's no use hiding it anymore. I- I hate you. Bitch.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27841","Zoey","I can't believe it. I really thought you and I were friends. Lord knows I could use a friend right now. I've been going through some pretty difficult stuff.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27842","Marshall","Difficult stuff? What difficult stuff?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27843","Lily","I don't know.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27844","Marshall","Well, you did the right thing, baby.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27845","Lily","Not entirely.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27846","Lily","Zoey, wait! I don't hate you! We just can't be friends anymore because... Robin hates you.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27847","Marshall","And that's Robin on the other line.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27848","Lily","Oh, well, I'll let you take that. Love you, baby!","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27849","Marshall","Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking... Listen, Robin. I know. I apologize for my wife. She never should have...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27850","Robin","Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27851","Marshall","Me? You dragged me into this?!","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27852","Robin","You just went through a tragedy. It's not like she's gonna call you up and...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27853","Marshall","Oh, God, that's my other line. Oh, God, it's a 917 number, and I don't recognize it! I think it's Zoey!","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27854","Robin","Just don't answer it.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27855","Marshall","I can't not answer. It's impolite.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27856","Robin","Marshall, you can beat this.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27857","Marshall","I can't turn my back on politeness.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27858","Robin","You don't have to answer. You can just let it ring.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27859","Marshall","Good manners are what separate us from those ""elbows on the table"" Wisconsinites.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27860","Robin","You can do this. I believe in you. Don't do it, Marshall!","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27861","Marshall","I'm sorry, Robin! Eriksen residence. Marshall speaking.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27862","Honey","Hi. I spent the night with your friend Barney and he accidentally left his phone in my apartment, in the garbage. But I've been going through all of his contacts because I'm sure he wants to get in touch with me. After all, he told me, uh... I was his first.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27863","Marshall","Oh, honey. Oh! Honey! Zoey's cousin.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27864","Honey","Hi.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27865","Marshall","Listen, um, about Barney...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27866","Honey","Oh, yeah. He's such a sweet guy.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27867","Barney","Who's your daddy?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27868","Honey, giggling","Oh... Who's your daddy?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27869","Barney, sobbing","I don't know.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27870","Honey","I guess he recently decided to get in touch with his dad. His mom gave him the guy's address.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27871","Barney","So I wrote him a letter. And I poured my heart out. And I gave him my number and I told him to call me. And he still hasn't called me.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27872","Honey","Oh, honey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27873","Barney","I mean, I shouldn't be surprised. Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27874","Honey","Oh, honey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27875","Barney","I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27876","Honey","Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you. He's ashamed of himself. I mean, look at you. You're do so great without him. I mean, you have an airline and three Nobel Prizes, and you play for the Yankees.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27877","Barney","Four. Four Nobel Prizes.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27878","Honey","Four. See? That is impressive. I mean, how many does he have?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27879","Barney","Only three.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27880","Honey","Well, there you go.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27881","Marshall","Hey, uh, listen, Honey, while I've got you, do you have any idea what kind of difficult stuff Zoey's been going through?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27882","Honey","Oh, I can't tell you about that. The only people that are allowed to know are me, Zoey and her therapist.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27883","Marshall","I am her therapist.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27884","Honey","Oh! Well, in that case...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27885","Marshall","Uh, okay, listen, I think we've made great progress for today. I got to go. Bye. Mom! Marcus!","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27886","Zoey","What's this really about?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27887","Ted","I told you. Lily hates you.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27888","Zoey","I think you hate me. I think you have some big problem with me, and you're too chicken to come out and say it.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27889","Ted","All right. Yes. I... hate you.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27890","Zoey","Great. See? Was that so hard?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27891","Ted","Zoey.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27892","Zoey","Can you at least tell me why? Because I'm racking my brain here, and I thought... I just want to know why.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27893","Marshall","So we got Ted and Zoey. Ted is in love with Zoey. Zoey has no idea. Then Zoey's cousin Honey went home with Barney, and Zoey was happy about it. Which tells us what?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27894","Marcus","Zoey's in love with...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27895","Marshall","Zoey's in love with Ted and Ted doesn't know. So Ted and Zoey... they're in love with each other, which would be fine if Zoey wasn't married to Colonel Mustard. I mean, The Captain. Except now, as Honey informs me...","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27896","Ted","And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27897","Zoey","Fine, I will, uh, make it happen. Good-bye. Okay. Well... I guess I'll take it.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27898","Marshall","Zoey and The Captain are getting divorced. Which means...?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27899","Marcus","So help me, Marshall, if you don't call those two crazy, mixed-up kids, I will.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27900","Marshall","Give me that phone.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27901","Ted","Why do I hate you? Are you kidding? Uh, you're actively trying to prevent me from realizing a lifelong dream. So there's that. Plus, you're stubborn and-and-and argumentative. And what kind of name is Zoey, huh? What is that, short for Zoseph? (cell phone ringing) Go on, get it. I'll have more in a second.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27902","Zoey","Hello. Oh, hey, Marshall...Yes, I am...Yes, I am...He is?...Bye.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27903","Ted","Why was Marshall calling?","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27904","Zoey","Don't worry about it. Go on.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27905","Ted","You talk during movies. You-You-You sneeze with your whole body. Uh, to my knowledge, you do not speak Portuguese.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27906","Zoey","Well, actually... (speaking Portuguese)","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27907","Ted","You're a show-off.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27908","Zoey","You better take that.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27909","Ted","Uh, hey, Marshall, can I call you back? I'm out in the hallway with... She is? She is? Marshall, I got to go.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27910","Neighbour","They're kissing.","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27911","Marshall","They're kissing?! Yeah! (screams) They're kissing!","06","15","Oh Honey"
"27912","Ted from 2030","My first kiss with Zoey was amazing, and complicated.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27913","Ted","Look, um... I know you're going through a lot right now. Getting divorced, being single, figuring out who you are on your own.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27914","Zoey","Someone knows how to set a mood.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27915","Ted","I just mean... I'm okay taking this slow. I want to do this right.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27916","Ted from 2030","My friends, as usual, were completely supportive.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27917","Barney","You're doing this all wrong! Ted, there are couples in my kindergarten class who have moved faster than you two. Granted, their home lives are not great.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27918","Ted","Hey, I'm trying. I keep suggesting these big, romantic dates, and she keeps putting on the brakes. Like tonight, she wants me to just come over and bake cookies.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27919","Robin","Oh. Translation  booty-call.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27920","Barney","Total booty-call.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27921","Lily","Private Booty, reporting for duty.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27922","Ted","That's crazy. She-She wants to bake.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27923","Robin","Guys booty-call girls after 2 00 a.m. with a drunkenly slurred, ""What ya doing?"" But when a lady booty-calls a guy, she invents a respectable excuse to mask the fact that she wants to get stuck real good.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27924","Lily","It's called class, Ted.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27925","Ted","Wait. That... You think that's what she means by ""baking cookies""?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27926","Lily","Are you kidding? You're in the kitchen, it's getting hot, you start licking stuff off each others' fingers. Before you know it, she's bent over the marble island, and you're spanking her with a rubber spatula. And she's screaming, ""Stop, Marshall, stop,"" but that's just code for ""harder!""","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27927","Ted","Marshall's been in Minnesota a while, huh?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27928","Lily","So long! And now he's staying even longer. His mom has been having a really hard time since the funeral. He's waiting on her hand and foot. But... it's Valentine's Day. It's not going to be the same without the two of us watching Predator together.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27929","Ted from 2030","I should explain. On their very first Valentine's Day, Marshall and Lily set out to watch Sleepless in Seattle.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27930","Marshall","You know, I saw this in the theater, like, five times, but I never got to see it with the right girl.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27931","Lily","I'm so glad none of those girls were right for you.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27932","Marshall","What girls?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27933","ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER","If it bleeds, we can kill it.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27934","Ted from 2030","Except Marshall's brothers had taped over it with Predator. And it became a tradition.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27935","Barney","Wow, you sound really lonely.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27936","Lily","I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears...","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27937","Barney","Shh. Daddy's talking now. Loneliness. The looming specter of Valentine's Day fast approaching. The two key ingredients to my favorite day of the year, February 13  Desperation Day.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27938","Robin","That's not a thing.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27939","Barney","It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27940","Ted","That's actually true.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27941","Barney","Wait, there's more.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27942","Ted","This won't be.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27943","Barney","And right by Saint Valentine's side was his best bro, Saint Desperatius, there to pick off insecure bridesmaids.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27944","Saint Desperatius","Whoa. Check out that one. Her body is a perfect X.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27945","Saint Valentine","Player, play on. High V.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27946","Woman","Oh, Jupiter, what are your plans for me? 15 and still unmarried.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27947","Saint Desperatius","And I thought Pompeii was smokin'.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27948","Barney","Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day. That neediness reaches its climax... what up... on February 13. A magical night when a ten has the self-esteem of a four and the depraved enthusiasm of a two. Now, there's only one thing you can't do.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27949","Robin","Please say ""widows.""","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27950","Barney","Wherever you are, or whoever you're under, you must get home alone by 11 59 p.m. Otherwise, you're on a date on Valentine's Day.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27951","Robin","Barney, Desperation Day assumes that all single women freak out about Valentine's Day. Which we do not. Case in point, I will be spending February 13 with some lovely single ladies from work...","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27952","Barney","Trolls.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27953","Robin","...who could care less about Valentine's Day.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27954","Barney","Lying trolls.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27955","Robin","And we will be celebrating the fact that we don't have to spend it with some dippy guy carting around roses and stuffed toys all night. Oh, no offense, Ted.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27956","Ted","And none was taken until just then.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27957","Lily","I decided to go to Minnesota to see Marshall. He shouldn't have to help his mom through this rough time all by himself.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27958","Barney","You losing your mind, being alone in your apartment?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27959","Lily","I'm getting weird!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27960","Lily","See, it started off with me throwing Marshall's jersey on my body pillow. And, well, things kind of spiraled from there. I'm sorry I yelled like that before.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27961","Lily","I call him ""Marshpillow."" And he calls me... nothing because he's a pillow.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27962","Robin","Hey. How was ""baking cookies"" last night?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27963","Ted from 2030","That was a tough question. You see...","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27964","Zoey","Uh... Is that an overnight bag?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27965","Lily","You brought an overnight bag?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27966","Ted","You guys said I was definitely going to spend the night.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27967","Barney","We said you were going to have s*x. We didn't say, ""Bring a carry-on.""","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27968","Robin","So how did Zoey react?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27969","Ted","She thought it was presumptuous and asked me to leave. It's-It's not like I brought a ton of stuff.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27970","Robin","Were there slippers for the morning?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27971","Ted","Not slippers, exactly.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27972","Ted","They're called British morning socks.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27973","Judy","This is such a nice surprise. Marshall will be so happy.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27974","Lily","How are you holding up, Judy?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27975","Judy","Oh, I'm doin' okay. It gets a little lonely. My friends suggested a body pillow, but...(chuckles) I'm not a lunatic.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27976","Marshall","Hey, Mom? I hate to be that guy, but I'm pretty sure it was Hot Pocket o'clock, like, ten minutes ago. Lily. What are you doing here?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27977","Lily","I wanted to surprise you.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27978","Marshall","Oh, my gosh. That's so sweet. I'm so glad you're here. Hey, um, before I forget, Mom, did you remember to get more double-A batteries?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27979","Judy","Oh, they're upstairs, sweetie. Right next to your washed and folded clothes.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27980","Marshall","Oh, great, okay. I don't want my Game Boy to crap out. I'm having the sickest Dr. Mario run of my life. Okay. I'll be right back. I love you, Lily. Okay. You're the best, Mom.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27981","Judy","Aw... Anything for my baby bear. Get him out of my house. Take Marshall back to New York with you. Please, I am begging you.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27982","Lily","I thought he was here helping you.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27983","Judy","Well, he was, at first. But once he saw me starting to do better, he kind of regressed. He's been holed up in his room for days at a time, playing old video games. I mean, he is having a pretty sick Dr. Mario run, but...","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27984","Lily","Uh, I'll talk to him.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27985","Judy","I want to be there for him, but it's like he's a teenager again. I even walked in on him abusing himself.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27986","Lily","Oh, God.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27987","Judy","There he was, on the bed, looking at old photos of his dad. That's emotional self-abuse, don't you think?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27988","Ted","Listen, that was a dumb move for me to just assume...","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27989","Zoey","No, no, I overreacted. I mean, I invited you over to ""bake cookies."" We both knew what that meant.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27990","Ted","We totally did.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27991","Zoey","I just, you know... I saw those slippers in your bag, and suddenly everything felt really serious. And... ever since, I've been asking myself, ""Am I ready for this?"" And... the answer is ""yes.""","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27992","Ted","They're actually called British morning socks.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27993","Zoey","Yeah. Don't get in your own way.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27994","Ted","Right. Okay.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27995","Lily","Um, Marshall, your mom asked me to carry this up. She turned her ankle on your Hot Wheels. Is my track okay? It's fine, but, Marshall, I thought you were here taking care of your mom. It seems like she's taking care of you.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27996","Marshall","My mom loves to feel needed. Letting her take care of me is how I'm taking care of her. She's in a dark place, Lily. She needs this. Mom? You forgot my chocolate milk with the swirly straw!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27997","Judy","Oops. Comin' right up!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27998","Marshall, whispers","She needs this.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"27999","Lily","Marshall, tomorrow's Valentine's. Don't you want to be at home on our couch, cuddling up under a warm blanket, watching the Predator use his heat vision to stalk helpless prey?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28000","Marshall","Well, baby, we could watch Predator here. No, my mom can go rent it for us after she's done digging out the car.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28001","Lily","Marshall, your mom wants you out of here.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28002","Marshall","What?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28003","Judy","Anything else, sweetie?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28004","Marshall","Mom, d-do you want me to leave?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28005","Judy","Heavens to Bess, no! Of course not!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28006","Lily","But, Judy, you said...","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28007","Judy","Oh, if Marshall could stay here forever, I would be the happiest mom in Minnesota.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28008","Zoey","So Valentine's Day is tomorrow.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28009","Ted","Yeah. You know, there's this new Italian restaurant on 79th that's supposed to be amazing.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28010","Zoey","I would be happier having just a simple, home-cooked meal. As long as it's with you.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28011","Ted","Tomorrow night, my place.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28012","Zoey","I'm ready for this, Ted. I am in it for the long haul. I can't wait for our first Valentine's Day as a couple. The one we'll remember for years.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28013","Ted","Isn't that great?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28014","Robin","Yeah, if you say so, yeah.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28015","Ted","What do you mean?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28016","Robin","Look, she just got out of a marriage, Ted. That's heavy. I'm kind of freaking out, just listening to you. My heart is pounding, I'm hearing this weird clicking noise.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28017","Ted","Well, it's romantic, right? Zoey and I are getting serious on Valentine's Day.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28018","Robin","See, that just amps up the pressure even more. Boy, it's a good thing that you're sure.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28019","Ted","Who said I wasn't sure? I'm glad we're in a serious relationship. Right away. And if I screw this up, I'm the devil, because she's going through a divorce. But I'm not going to screw this up. So stop freaking out, Robin. Stop freaking out!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28020","Ted from 2030","Kids, I'm not super proud of what I did next.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28021","Ted","Hi! I'm here to help Marshall.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28022","Ted from 2030","Meanwhile, as Desperation Day turned into Desperation Night...","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28023","Barney","God, these girls are so hungry for male attention. It is like being a hunter and having the deer walk up, tie itself to the hood of your car and beg to get mounted.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28024","Robin","Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28025","Barney","Enchanté. That's French for ""What's with the purple?""","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28026","Robin","Well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and everything is pink and red, so Bev very thoughtfully suggested that we wear purple to show how little we care.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28027","Bev","I use, uh, colors to express emotion. Purple is for pride. It was a stupid idea.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28028","Anna","Bev, you look at me. It's not a stupid idea. Tonight, we are queens.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28029","Robin","And we don't care about some stupid, sexist, corporate holiday.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28030","Barney","Please! You might as well be dog-earing a tear-stained bridal magazine while wolfing down the box of chocolates you had delivered to yourself at work from your ""fiancé"" who no one's ever met.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28031","Bev","Gerard is real!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28032","Lily","Ted... I thought you were going to talk to Marshall about coming back to New York.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28033","Ted","Yeah, but, you know, things move so fast in New York. Why not hang out here until at least after Valentine's Day. Plus, we're helping Marshall's mom. Uh, Mrs. Eriksen, we're running low on SunnyD!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28034","Judy","Is orange juice okay?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28035","Ted & Marshall","No!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28036","Barney","Okay, when your ""fiancé"" Gerard comes back from fixing cleft palates in Peru, maybe snatch a photo of the two of you together, and then I'll totally believe you.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28037","Bev","Well, he's going to Kenya after Peru, so...","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28038","Nora","Hey, guys, so sorry I'm late.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28039","Robin","Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna beat him in an arm wrestle?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28040","Barney","My elbow slipped!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28041","Lily","Marshall, I'm going home.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28042","Marshall","What?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28043","Lily","I'm flying out tonight before the big storm, and I want you to come with me.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28044","Marshall","I can't right now, 'cause my mom needs me.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28045","Lily","While I'm sure it's been really helpful for her to have you here playing Super Mario Kart for 14 hours a day...","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28046","Ted","You have Super Mario Kart?!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28047","Marshall","Hell, yeah.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28048","Lily","But your mom doesn't need you. Your life in New York needs you. It needs you really bad.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28049","Marshall","Baby, don't go.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28050","Lily","Please come home soon.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28051","Barney","So, you were an Olympic gymnast?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28052","Woman","Silver medal.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28053","Barney","Ooh, sorry. Gold's the only thing that really counts.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28054","Woman","That's what my dad said.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28055","Barney","And she sticks the landing. Why don't you start stretching, and I'll... be right back. Hey, hey, sorry.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28056","Nora","Oh, hi.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28057","Barney","Quick question.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28058","Nora","Yeah.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28059","Barney","Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28060","Nora","Oh, I told them I forgot, but the truth is, I'm kind of protesting their protest. Can you keep a secret?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28061","Barney","Sure.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28062","Nora","I love Valentine's Day.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28063","Barney","Oh, my gosh! Me, too! Um, is it getting crowded in here, 'cause I think there are two peas in this pod?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28064","Nora","Oh, you're a gooey romantic, too?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28065","Barney","Guilty. This is embarrassing but every year, I buy flowers and a box of chocolates, even if I'm not with someone. Just in case, you know?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28066","Nora","We are pitiful.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28067","Barney","The worst.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28068","Nora","Although there is one difference between you and me.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28069","Barney","What's that?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28070","Nora","I'm not saying any of this to get in your pants.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28071","Marshall","I miss my dad, Ted. I miss him so much.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28072","Ted","I know.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28073","Marshall","Um, when I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula. And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till, like, the middle of the night. And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28074","Barney","All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13... a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28075","Nora","What's desperate about knowing what you want? Look, life is really short, Barney. Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone, distracting yourself from the fact that nobody loves you with some sad little activity?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28076","Barney","Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28077","Nora","I have no idea what any of those words mean.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28078","Woman","Hey, I'm all stretched out!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28079","Barney","Here's the first thing you need to know about laser tag.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28080","Marshall","Thanks a lot for coming out here, man.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28081","Ted","Yeah.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28082","Marshall","Hey, are-are you sure it's okay with Zoey that you're here for Valentine's Day?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28083","Ted","Well, I mean, technically, she doesn't know yet.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28084","Marshall","What?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28085","Ted","Things with Zoey are moving really fast, and the divorce just makes everything more complicated. I just, I needed to take a step back.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28086","Marshall","You're not taking a step back. You're running away. And hiding out here, hiding out here is not gonna solve anything. You're just holed up in Minnesota because you're too scared to face reality, and it's... We got to go back to New York, tonight.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28087","Ted","We're snowed in. Lily got the last flight.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28088","Marshall","So, we drive. It's time. It's time to get back to real life. It's time to grow up. Yeah Mom! Can you make us some PB and J's for the road?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28089","Ted","Crusts cut off.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28090","Marshall","Crusts cut off! No, Ted. What are we...? We're men. Mom! Leave the crusts on! They forced their opponents to scatter, picking them off, one by one, in a swift and merciless slaughter.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28091","Barney","...became the 2010 Tri-County Champions.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28092","Nora","Wow. Laser tag sounds brilliant!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28093","Barney","Oh, it is. Plus, if you win, you get free pizza. This is my teammate for tomorrow.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28094","Robin","Oh, yeah, I agreed to that.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28095","Nora","Where are Bev and Anna?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28096","Robin","Well...","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28097","Bev","So, we're taking off.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28098","Robin","What?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28099","Anna","Those guys are gonna buy us hot dogs at Grey's Papaya.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28100","Robin","What...? So that's it? A couple of white Urkels offer you sausages, and you're gone? What about the sisterhood? Solidarity? The color purple?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28101","Bev","But tomorrow's Valentine's Day.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28102","Robin","I thought we didn't care about Valentine's Day.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28103","Anna","Look, Robin, you'll find someone, too. You're a queen. You've got so much to offer. Maybe do something with that hair.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28104","Barney","I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28105","Nora","Well, I think I'm heading out, too.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28106","Barney","What? No, don't go! You want to see a magic trick?!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28107","Nora","It's late, and I have a date with my pillow. I mean, not literally. I'm not a lunatic. Boy Scout Troop 15 doesn't stand a chance. Bye.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28108","Robin","Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day...","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28109","Barney","What are you talking about?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28110","Robin","Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28111","Barney","No, I don't. She's gross.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28112","Robin","Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28113","Barney","Whatever you say.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28114","Robin","Oh, hey, Nora.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28115","Barney","Nora...","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28116","MARVIN","Here's a secret. I couldn't see worth a damn, either, buddy. I just kept driving forward, hoping for the best. Look out! Gotcha.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28117","Ted from 2030","And so we drove through the night, out of Desperation Day and into Valentine's. And there was no trace of my little freak out, except...","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28118","Zoey","Really? An overnight bag for your own living room? Looks like we got a matching set.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28119","Ted","Well, that was kind of presumptuous.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28120","Barney","The ground was shaking like. Robin, where are you? Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot since last year. They're terrifying!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28121","Robin","Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28122","Barney","Hap...?","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28123","Nora","Hey, Barney. Robin told me to meet you guys here.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28124","Ted from 2030","And that's how, for the first time in his life, Barney Stinson wound up on a date on Valentine's Day.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28125","Barney","Oh!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28126","Nora","You will be avenged.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28127","SCHWARZENEGGER (over TV)","Come on! Come on! Kill me! I'm here! Kill me!","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28128","Lily","Baby, you're back.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28129","Marshall","Happy Valentine's Day, Lily Pad. Oh.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28130","Lily","We both knew this would end eventually.","06","16","Desperation Day"
"28131","Ted from 2030","Kids, sometimes wonderful things come out of horrible situations. Like, remember that trip I took to Hong Kong where I got stuck in the airport? Well, a funny thing happened that day.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28132","Ted","Yes, I realize it's raining, but, come on, it's 2021. We can make cell phones that project holograms, but a light drizzle shuts down a whole airport?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28133","Wendy","Hey, Ted.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28134","Ted","Hey... There she is. Wow.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28135","Wendy","Wendy the Waitress.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28136","Ted","Wendy the Waitress! I was just saying-- what are you doing here?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28137","Ted from 2030","What was she doing there? For that, we have to back up about ten years.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28138","Robin","So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28139","Barney","I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28140","Robin","Not according to her.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28141","Nora","Oh, my God, this was so much fun. We have to do this again. We do, we have to.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28142","Barney","You want to grab a drink right now?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28143","Nora","No, I'm kind of tired. But... this is my number. Give me a call.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28144","Barney","Absolutely.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28145","Robin","How is that a disaster?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28146","Barney","She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28147","Barney","You want to grab a drink right now?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28148","Nora","No, I'm kind of tired.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28149","Barney","Absolutely.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28150","Barney","It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28151","Robin","Please, Cheese. You like this girl.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28152","Barney","What? Nora? No, I don't.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28153","Robin","Barney, you can't say her name without smiling.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28154","Barney","That's... Nora. Sorry, sorry. I was thinking of a funny thing that Nora said. Hmm. Stop it. No... ra. Nah... Damn it, what is the matter with me?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28155","Robin","You like her. You should call her.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28156","Barney","Call her? she had a nice face, her booty was in place, but Barney don't chase.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28157","Robin","That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28158","Barney","Totally.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28159","Ted from 2030","Kids, I had just started dating Zoey. And when you first start dating someone, everyone wants to know the same thing. How did we meet?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28160","Woman","Oh, Ted, she doesn't want...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28161","Ted","No, it's a cute story. Once upon a time...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28162","Ted","Zoey was married to this super rich, super creepy guy called The Captain. So when Zoey and I became friends, I was careful not to cross any lines.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28163","Zoey","Oh, man, this movie is scary.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28164","Ted","I know, right? But then one day, Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight. He flipped out and demanded a divorce. And she was heartbroken. But after a little soul-searching, she ended up back in my and the rest, as they say, is history.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28165","Woman","Actually, I said, ""How's your meat?""","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28166","Ted","Oh. A little cold.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28167","Woman","Gee, wonder why.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28168","Zoey","Oh, Ted, did you have a chance to pick up that box I left at my old apartment?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28169","Ted","Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain. I mean this in a super manly way. That guy scares the panties off me.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28170","Zoey","You don't have to see him. He left the box with the doorman.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28171","Ted","If it's really important to you, I will pick it up tomorrow.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28172","Marshall","All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big meaningless stack of paperwork that I have to get off my desk to make room for tomorrow's big meaningless stack of paperwork. But it's all worth it, you know, 'cause at least I know I'm making the world a... place. All right, see you guys later.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28173","Ted","I'm worried about Marshall. He doesn't seem like himself lately.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28174","Lily","Yeah, he's been really... quiet.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28175","Robin","Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28176","Barney","Like Prince.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28177","Lily","No, it's more than that. It's like, all the stuff he used to love, he suddenly has no interest in anymore.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28178","Barney","Oh. Ha-wink","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28179","Lily","Excuse me?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28180","Barney","Lily, in my travels, I've developed a finely calibrated sense of how long it's been since... How do I not put this delicately?... a girl's been porked. And, boo, you've been pork-free so long, you're practically kosher.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28181","Lily","It's been a while.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28182","Barney","Five weeks, three days by my estimation.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28183","Lily","You should work at a carnival.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28184","Barney","I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28185","Ted","Anyway, we should get going.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28186","Lily","Yeah, I'll walk out with you guys.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28187","Robin","Good night. Good night, guys.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28188","Barney","18 weeks.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28189","Robin","Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28190","Barney","Shh. Child, listen. If you're really hurting for it, I'd be more than happy to throw you one.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28191","Robin","Throw me one? Yeah.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28192","Barney","We're exes. We're probably due for a backslide. Or we could just do it the normal way.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28193","Robin","Oh, I see what's going on.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28194","Barney","Yeah?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28195","Robin","This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your shot. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28196","Barney","Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my shot?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28197","Robin","Nora met a guy. What?!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28198","Barney","What?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28199","Robin","Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28200","Barney","But ""L'Amour"" means love! They're going to the cafe of love! I'm fine. It's fine. Point is, Robin, I don't even like Nora. Damn it!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28201","Lily","Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28202","Marshall","I can't sleep.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28203","Lily","Mmm. Anything I can do to help you with that?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28204","Marshall","Maybe after this documentary on garbage.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28205","Lily","Man, I am losing my touch.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28206","Tv","Nearly twice the size of Texas, the Gweat Pacific Garbage Patch, or ""Garbage Island,"" is an enviwonmental disaster. Sepawated from its pawents, this young bird stwuggles to survive, stwangling itself in the plastic wings of a six-pack. Marshall Eriksen, I think you know what you have to do.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28207","Marshall","I have to save the planet!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28208","Lily","Is it over? I call on top.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28209","Ted from 2030","A few days later, I headed over to The Captain's building to get Zoey's box.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28210","Ted","I'm here to...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28211","Captain","Ted. What a surprise. Ted.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28212","Ted","Captain. I...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28213","Captain","You've come to rescue me from the capsized wreckage of my marriage. Mm... I hesitated calling you because I know you and Zoey were friendly.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28214","Ted","Pssh, nah...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28215","Captain","But my wife has left me. All my friends have abandoned me. Please, tell me you're on my side. Let's adjourn to the study.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28216","Marshall","Garbage Island. You haven't heard of Garbage Island? It's an island... made of garbage! It's in the Pacific Ocean. It's twice the size of Texas!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28217","Robin","In other words, one-eighth the size of Canada. So...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28218","Marshall","Guys, I'm going environmental, okay? Phase one  the bar. I've already convinced MacLaren's to implement a new green initiative.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28219","Wendy","That's 'cause of you? I got to carry an 80-pound bag of bottles to the recycling center every night. I threw my back out.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28220","Marshall","You're welcome... Earth. Phase two  GNB. Tomorrow I'm going to make a presentation in front of the board about how we can cut our carbon footprint by half for only $12 million.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28221","Barney","Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is ""$12 million,"" and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28222","Ted","Guys, I got a problem. I ran into The Captain.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28223","Captain","Ted, beneath this lustrous mane,I wear the horns of a cuckold. Zoey left me for another man.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28224","Ted","Wow.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28225","Captain","Do you have any idea who it could be?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28226","Ted from 2030","The Captain then told a story much different than the one I'd been telling. But one maybe just as true.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28227","Captain","Once upon a time, Zoey and I were happy. Blissful as Arcadian shepherds. I was Poseidon, she my Amphitrite. I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis could not have torn us asunder. We had great big boners for each other. But then... enter the scoundrel. I don't know what he looks like, but I picture him with a mustache.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28228","Ted","Yes! Limit the search to guys with mustaches. Smart.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28229","Captain","Anyway, soon the inevitable happened. She told me she was in love with someone else. Obviously, it made me angry.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28230","Ted","And that's the last time you saw her.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28231","Captain","But I gathered my composure, and told her I'd do anything to keep her. I begged her not to leave. We made love that night.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28232","Ted","That's damn good brandy.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28233","Captain","But morning came, and she was gone.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28234","Ted","Oh, Captain... don't blame yourself.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28235","Captain","I don't blame myself. Hmm? There's only one man I blame for this.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28236","Ted","Me. I'm the bad guy.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28237","Robin","Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28238","Ted","Damn it! The box!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28239","Marshall","Baby, baby, I really got to work on this presentation.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28240","Lily","Oh, that's too bad, 'cause I was going to make a little presentation of my own.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28241","Marshall","Okay, why not  from now until tomorrow afternoon, I do this, and then tomorrow night, I do that.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28242","Lily","Deal. Come on, come on.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28243","Marshall","Lily!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28244","Barney","You lying little minx. I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight from 5 00 p.m. until closing, reading a newspaper with two holes cut out of it, and I never saw Nora or this Italian race car driver she's dating.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28245","Robin","Sorry. Who said anything about an...?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28246","Barney","Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28247","Robin","No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28248","Barney","No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28249","Robin","You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28250","Barney","No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great pen1s comes great responsibility.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28251","Robin","Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28252","Barney","Sorry?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28253","Robin","I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28254","Barney","Careful, Robin, I'll do it.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28255","Robin","Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28256","Barney","Don't poke the dragon, Robin, 'cause the dragon will poke you back.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28257","Lily","s*x now, we'll do the foreplay after.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28258","Marshall","Oh, no, baby, come on. Today didn't go so well.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28259","Marshall","The green initiative, for only $12 million, will change the way...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28260","Arthur","Okay, I've heard enough. Don't we already have a green initiative? I mean, didn't we do a whole thing? Hang a banner, make a video, Sting was there. I thought I met Sting.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28261","Man","You did meet Sting.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28262","Arthur","Yeah, I met Sting. So why on Earth would we spend another $12 million?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28263","Marshall","Well, because we can always do more.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28264","Arthur","Yeah, but I met Sting.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28265","Marshall","Well, meeting Sting isn't gonna fix anything, Arthur!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28266","Arthur","Who here supports Eriksen's proposal?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28267","Meeker","Well, he has some good points.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28268","Arthur","Meeker, you're fired! And as for you, Eriksen...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28269","Man","His father just died.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28270","Arthur","...nice presentation. We'll keep it under advisement.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28271","Marshall","Meeker got fired because of me. I'm the bad guy.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28272","Lily","No, sweetie, just-just put all that out of your mind and relax. Look, I got you a six-pack of tall boys from the deli.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28273","Marshall","Hey, baby.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28274","Lily","Yeah?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28275","Marshall","What happened to the plastic rings that held the six-pack together?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28276","Lily","Oh, I-I don't know. I threw them down the garbage chute. Let's just use the handcuffs instead.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28277","Marshall","Baby, birds can get caught in those and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish! Weren't you listening? Don't you care about Garbage Island?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28278","Lily","Marshall, right now, I don't give a wat's ass about Garbage Island.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28279","Marshall","Well, I do. I got to find those rings!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28280","Lily","Cwap.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28281","Ted","Hi, I'm here to pick up...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28282","Captain","Hello, Ted.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28283","Ted","To the study?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28284","Captain","To the study! Mmm. Ted... I know.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28285","Ted","Know what?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28286","Captain","I know who stole my Zoey. No man likes to be betrayed, especially by a friend. You can imagine then how painful it was when I learned that the name of my betrayer is... Ted... when I tell you who it is, you're gonna... It's my doorman!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28287","Ted","That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28288","Captain","He always winks and tips his hat when he sees her. I know how these things work. He holds her package, and pretty soon, she's holding his. And then there's his glorious mustache. I will have him fired for this!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28289","Ted","No, no, no, you can't fire him.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28290","Captain","You're right. Maritime protocol demands physical retribution!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28291","Ted","Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28292","Captain","Who is this flower child, and what has he done with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28293","Ted","Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28294","Captain","Whoa, ""rapscallion"" may be going a bit far, Ted.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28295","Ted","But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28296","Captain","Why couldn't she just like boats? Just to have one thing in common? Other girls like boats, don't they?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28297","Ted","Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28298","Captain","When you put it that way, I should almost thank the doorman.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28299","Ted","Yeah, yeah! And, you know, since, since it doesn't really matter who Zoey's dating now...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28300","Captain","It doesn't, it really doesn't. It doesn't.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28301","Ted","It's me. You're welcome.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28302","Lily","Okay, baby, what gives?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28303","Marshall","I'm sorry, but neither of us are getting any action until I find those rings.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28304","Lily","I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28305","Barney","All right, Robin, give it to me.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28306","Robin","Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, ""Yeah, Barney, go get her!"" But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28307","Barney","The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28308","Robin","It's a five, idiot.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28309","Barney","A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28310","Robin","""Moon man language""? What does that even mean?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28311","Barney","How am I supposed to see that's a five?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28312","Robin","Look how you taped this up...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28313","Barney","Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28314","Robin","Barney. Go get her.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28315","Ted","Listen, Zoey, I need to ask you something. Did I steal you?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28316","Zoey","Well... yeah. You did. By being the kind of sweet, thoughtful guy who'd never even think of stealing someone, you stole me.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28317","Ted","So I'm the bad guy. Great.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28318","Zoey","Well, the story isn't over, Ted. It'll be years before we know who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. I mean, yes, divorce sucks, but sometimes things need to fall apart to make way for better things.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28319","Ted","If you say so.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28320","Zoey","I'm just saying, the eggs are already broken. Let's make sure we get a pretty good omelet out of it.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28321","Lily","Okay, Marshall, seriously, what's going on?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28322","Marshall","He'll never get to see how I turn out.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28323","Lily","What do you mean?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28324","Marshall","My dad. You know, I used to, um, I used to always tell him that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer. And he was always so proud of me for that. But he never got to see the version of me that was anything but a corporate stooge. And now it's too late. And we're starting a family, you know.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28325","Lily","Are you avoiding sleeping with me 'cause you don't want to start a family?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28326","Marshall","Lily, if we have a baby right now, that is just it for me. The cement will dry, and I will be stuck at GNB forever.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28327","Lily","Marshall, if you want to quit your job and go work for the NRDC right now, then you need to do that right now. And then, once you've cleaned up all the oceans and saved the planet... you know, like, a year from now... then we'll start a family.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28328","Marshall","I don't know. So far, in the name of saving the planet, I've ruined your night, I practically broke Wendy's back and I got Meeker fired. The guy must hate me.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28329","Lily","Meeker doesn't hate you.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28330","Ted from 2030","Oh, Meeker hated him, all right. After all, Marshall was the one who got him fired. Meeker knew we all hung out at MacLaren's. So that night, he went there to confront Marshall. But as luck would have it...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28331","Meeker","Are you guys...?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28332","Wendy","Closed. Sorry. Thanks.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28333","Meeker","Rough night?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28334","Wendy","Yeah.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28335","Meeker","I'm sorry.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28336","Wendy","It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. Except for Marshall Eriksen.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28337","Meeker","What did you just say?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28338","Wendy","Uh, I said it's Marshall Eriksen's fault. Why, do you know him?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28339","Meeker","Know him? I hate that guy.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28340","Wendy","Me, too.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28341","Meeker","Well, hey.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28342","Ted from 2030","And the rest, as they say...is history.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28343","Wendy","And three kids later, we decided to come here on our second honeymoon.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28344","Ted","Wow. That's a pretty good omelet.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28345","Wendy","Oh, and hey, what about you? You still with Zoey?","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28346","Ted","No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well. But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids. It's actually a funny story of how we met. I was a best man at this wedding...","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28347","Wendy","Listen, Ted, it's great seeing you, but we got to run.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28348","Ted","Okay, well, have a safe trip. It was great seeing you. (Ted phones Marshall) Hello. Marshall.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28349","Marshall","Hey, Ted.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28350","Ted","Hey. You will not believe who I just ran into.","06","17","Garbage Island"
"28351","Ted from 2030","Kids, the heart is a mysterious muscle. You never really know what's going on in there. So after Uncle Marshall lost his father, he decided to get his heart checked. And so did I... and so did Lily... and so did Robin. And then Marshall went again, just to be sure. There was only one holdout.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28352","Barney","I don't need to go to a heart doctor. I drink every day, I sleep three hours every night, and I have multiple s*x partners. I'm doing everything right.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28353","Ted","Barney, come on, this is important. We need you around for a long time. Without you, we'd have to find some other sex-fueled, depraved animal to entertain us.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28354","Robin","Actually, I'm thinking about getting a dog again.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28355","Lily","Oh, can she? Can she get a dog, please Dad?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28356","Ted","No. If you get a dog, I'm going to be the one stuck taking care of it.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28357","Robin","You wouldn't have to take care of it.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28358","Ted","Really? And who watered the philodendron on your bookcase and sang it back to life?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28359","Robin","Yeah, that was made out of silk, Ted.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28360","Marshall","Okay, Robin, what you need is indeed something that buries a bone, but I'm not talking about a dog. I'm talking about a man.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28361","Robin","Here we go.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28362","Marshall","You're clearly trying to fill a hole... in her heart. You feel like the seventh wheel, because now Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora and Lily's with Big Fudge.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28363","Barney","Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge. ""With""? I am not ""with"" Nora. Wrong preposition. Later tonight I'm hoping to be on Nora, right? Or under Nora, right? Or, we're all adults, I'll just say it... behind Nora.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28364","Robin","I don't know. This will be your second date.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28365","Lily","Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28366","Barney","Yeah. pen1s feelings. Because she's hot. Guys, as you know, I only have one rule...","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28367","Ted from 2030","Barney said this a lot.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28368","Barney","If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day [...] Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers [...] Never date a girl with a hook for a hand [...]","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28369","Barney","Never go out with the same girl more than once.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28370","Lily","Then why are you going out with Nora again?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28371","Barney","There is an exception.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28372","Ted from 2030","And it was always the same exception.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28373","Barney","...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28374","Barney","And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it. (He sneezes)","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28375","Barney","Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28376","Nora","Oh, no. How long have you been sick?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28377","Barney","About 20 minutes. Can't seem to shake it.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28378","Nora","Okay, 'cause I was going to say you look a little...","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28379","Barney","Handsome? Rich? Well-endowed?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28380","Nora","Huh, let's say well-endowed... with phlegm. All right, let's go. It's bedtime.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28381","Barney","The bed... that's where all the...happens.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28382","Nora","Come on, let's get you sorted out.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28383","Ted from 2030","That night, Barney didn't take care of business. Instead, Nora took care of Barney.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28384","Barney","Ah. Thank you.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28385","Nora","Good night, Barney.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28386","Barney","Good night, Mommy.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28387","Lily","Wow, she nursed you back to health?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28388","Barney","No. I didn't even see her boobs. She just took care of me.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28389","Robin","Oh, hey, guys. This is Nate. Nate, these are my friends.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28390","Nate","What's up. guys? Nate Scooberman. But everyone calls me Scooby. I'd love to hang out, but I really gotta hit the john.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28391","Ted","Uh, yeah, it's right in here... Scooby.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28392","Nate","Thanks, brah. I like you guys.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28393","Marshall","Oh, Robin, if you weren't so much stronger than me, I would slap you.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28394","Robin","What? You told me to meet someone.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28395","Marshall","I know, and, look, he seems plenty nice, but I didn't mean bring home the first guy you bump into on the street.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28396","Robin","Actually, I met him in the park.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28397","Ted","Should have just let you get a dog.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28398","Barney","Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28399","Lily","Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28400","Barney","No.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28401","Lily","Do you want me to go with you because you're a lot scared?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28402","Barney","Yes!","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28403","Lily","Okay, fine. On one condition. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora. She seems like something special.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28404","Barney","Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.* Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang *","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28405","Barney","* Bang, bang, bangity bang... *","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28406","The cardiologist","Are we done?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28407","Barney","* A bang-bang, bangity-bang. *","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28408","The cardiologist","Well, Barney, your heart sounds fine.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28409","Barney","See, Lily? She was worried.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28410","The cardiologist","Although it seems like you might have a slight arrhythmia.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28411","Lily","Ow! Nails, nails!","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28412","The cardiologist","It's probably nothing to worry about, but I'd like you to wear this heart monitor for the next 24 hours.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28413","Barney","Twen... Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28414","The cardiologist","Don't worry. It's totally safe. Unless part of your big date involves connecting yourself to a car battery.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28415","Barney","Well, now it doesn't.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28416","Ted from 2030","And exactly 24 hours later, they returned for the results.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28417","The cardiologist","Okay, everything looks fine here, although I did notice a few irregularities. There's nothing to be...alarmed about.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28418","Barney","Go on, Doctor.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28419","The cardiologist","What happened at 8 46 p.m. last night?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28420","Barney","Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28421","Nora","This might be a little forward, but do you have a bomb strapped to your chest?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28422","Barney","This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28423","Nora","Oh, I'm so sorry. I've been trying not to stare at your chest all night.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28424","Barney","What's that like?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28425","Nora","So is everything okay?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28426","Barney","My friend's dad passed away from a sudden heart attack. So I'm just getting myself checked out, too.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28427","Nora","Oh, I am so sorry.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28428","Barney","Thanks.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28429","Nora","Um, Barney, what I'm about to say is going to sound a little weird, but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28430","Barney","Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just... No. What is it?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28431","Nora","I want to get married. I mean, not tonight, or even to you, necessarily. But that's what I want. And if that's going to scare you off, then I'd rather it scare you off now. I want a family, and I want to live in a little house with a garden and a tree for the kids to climb. And I want to go to sleep every night with the same person by my side, and wake up next to him in the morning every morning for the rest of our lives. Just thought you should know that.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28432","Lily","You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora!","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28433","Barney","That's exactly what I want, too.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28434","Nate","I'm really into gardening, but these squirrels keep messing with my tomatoes. Every time I see them in the backyard, I'm like, ""get out of here!"" And they run off, but sure enough, a few minutes later, there they are again. And I'm like, ""get out of here!"" So annoying. I smell food. Does this place have a kitchen? I'll be right back.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28435","Robin","Okay, but you have to admit that he is a lot of fun.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28436","Marshall","Oh, I actually think he's quite intelligent for what he is.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28437","Robin","And what is he?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28438","Marshall","He's a dog.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28439","Ted","He's totally a dog.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28440","Robin","What? You saw him hitting on someone?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28441","Marshall","No, I didn't say, ""He a dawg."" I said, ""He's a dog."" As in, a dog. I think we've all noticed a few curious mannerisms. Or rather, doggerisms.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28442","Ted","Uh, Scooby, the tag's still on your jeans.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28443","Nate","Where?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28444","Marshall","Okay, Scooby, you ready?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28445","Ted","Good boy!","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28446","Robin","That last one did not happen.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28447","Marshall","Okay, you're right. He dropped it.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28448","Robin","He's not a dog.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28449","Ted","Robin, it's fine. You said you wanted a dog and you got one. And the best part is, he got his shots.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28450","Nate","Hey, guys, got my shots.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28451","Marshall","You are so playful.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28452","Ted","Nice job fetching those.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28453","Lily","Yeah, guys, cut it out. Scooby, sit.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28454","Marshall","So, Scooby, we were thinking if you're going to be hanging out with our Robin, you should be properly vetted.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28455","Ted","Uh, yeah. We hope our nosiness doesn't give you ""paws.""","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28456","Lily","How did you meet?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28457","Marshall","Tell us the ""tail""","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28458","Ted","Yes, how did you ""whisker"" off her feet? Shed a little light on the matter.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28459","Lily","Did you send her an e-mail, or did you ""collar""?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28460","Robin","Guys, just stop hounding him. Oh, geez.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28461","Marshall","No, no, you're right, Robin. We don't want your new guy to ""flea.""","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28462","Lily","We're just trying to make sure he's not a heel.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28463","Ted","So, moving from Canada, that transition must have been pretty ""ruff.""","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28464","Nate","Sure was. My part of Canada's pretty different from New York.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28465","Lily","Oh, I bet it was an ""Incredible Journey""""","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28466","Marshall","What part of Canada is that? Speak.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28467","Nate","Labrador.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28468","Lily","This isn't happening.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28469","Robin","Hey, Nate, why don't you go play some music on the jukebox.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28470","Nate","No, I'm good.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28471","Robin","Oh, shoot, dropped my keys.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28472","Nate","I'll get 'em.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28473","Barney","Hey, guys, this is Nora.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28474","Nora","We were just passing by, and I wanted to pop in for two reasons. First, I wanted to let you know that your friend Barney is being a perfect gentleman.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28475","Robin","Well, it's still early.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28476","Nora","I'm being serious. I had no idea that deep down, he's such a romantic.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28477","Lily","I had no idea he had a deep down.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28478","Nora","Oh, you should have heard him at dinner.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28479","Barney","I mean, I like being single, but secretly, I want to have kids.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28480","Nora","How many do you want?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28481","Barney","Three... one of each. You?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28482","Nora","Three. All in an old stone house.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28483","Barney","Yeah, with ivy growing on it.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28484","Barney","And we must have a pool.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28485","Nora","We? A pool sounds brilliant. Are you for real, Barney?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28486","Barney","I really am.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28487","Robin","Unbelievable.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28488","Nora","I know, right? And the second reason we popped in is 'cause I need to use the loo. But when I get back, I'm dying to hear all about Mr. Softy here.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28489","Barney","I assure you, that's not a nickname that I...","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28490","The cardiologist","And that explains your 14-second cardiac arrest.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28491","Lily","Barney, you promised you wouldn't lie.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28492","Barney","I'm not lying! Guys, Nora's really special. In fact... I think I'm... falling in love with her. Guys! I'm serious.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28493","Lily","I'm not going to let you do this. When Nora gets back here, I'm blowing the whistle.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28494","Marshall","Just make sure it's not a high-frequency whistle, because we don't want to torture Robin's boyfriend.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28495","Barney","Guys, this is real. And if you don't make me look good in front of Nora, just remember  I've got dirt on each of you, and I am not afraid to spill it.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28496","Lily","Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28497","Barney","Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know... your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28498","Lily","Mr. Buttons? Oh, you son of a bitch. Fine. I'll be nice.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28499","Barney","Marshall?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28500","Marshall","You got nothing on me.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28501","Barney","The calzone?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28502","Marshall","Checkmate.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28503","Barney","Robin.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28504","Robin","Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream...","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28505","Barney","The Mr. T dream...","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28506","Robin","I'm lost.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28507","Barney","Ted?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28508","Ted","Go ahead. Give me your best. My life's an open book.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28509","Barney","The ballet class.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28510","Ted","I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28511","Barney","The 'N Sync concert.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28512","Ted","1998. Cleveland's Gund Arena, front row. Caught JC's shirt. What else you got?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28513","Barney","Okay, Ted. The thermos.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28514","Ted","I suppose it's possible Barney has real feelings for Nora.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28515","Barney","I do! So be cool!","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28516","Nora","There's a man back there who seems fascinated by the records flipping in the jukebox.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28517","Robin","Sorry, toots. He's taken.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28518","Nora","So. How do you all know Barney?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28519","Lily","Oh, I don't know how we know Barney. How does anyone know how they know anyone? I like your pretty hair, help me.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28520","Marshall","We did not meet him at a strip club. No, sir. Because... Barney don't go to no strip clubs.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28521","Nora","Oh, come on. Barney's been to a strip club once.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28522","Ted","Once?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28523","Barney","Thermos.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28524","Ted","Nope. Not even once.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28525","Nora","Really? So Barney really is a genuinely a nice guy.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28526","Lily","I don't recall.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28527","Marshall","Okay, I think that we're done here, I think that we have adequately established that Barney is... the kind of guy that you would bring home to meet your parents. Okay? So... let's just drop it, all right?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28528","Nora","It's funny you should say that, because, as it happens, my parents are in town. They're only here like once a year. We're getting brunch tomorrow. Do you want to meet them?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28529","Ted from 2030","This was a big deal for Barney.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28530","Barney","I only have one rule. Never, ever, ever meet a girl's parents.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28531","Ted","Not even if she's hot?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28532","Barney","Not even if her mom's hot.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28533","Barney","I'd love to meet your parents.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28534","Nora","It's a date. Well, we should get going. Walk me home?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28535","Nate","Walk? Somebody say walk? I'll go for a walk. I love a good walk.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28536","Barney","No, Scooby, you, uh... stay!","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28537","Robin","Oh, no. I got called back in to work. Can you keep an eye on him until I get back? He's new to the city, and he doesn't really know anyone.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28538","Ted","I knew it. I knew it. I knew if you got a dog, I'd wind up taking care of it.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28539","Robin","He's not a... Good night.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28540","Nate","What do we do now? Oh! I got an idea. I was in the park today, and this guy sold me a big bag of...","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28541","Ted from 2030","Kids, it was a big bag of sandwiches.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28542","Marshall","Whoa. Put that away.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28543","Nate","You guys want to fire these up?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28544","Lily","Scooby, we're in our 30s. We don't smoke sandwiches anymore.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28545","Ted","Sandwich brownies?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28546","Nate","Okay.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28547","Marshall","Sandwiches make me hungry.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28548","Ted","Truth. Hey. I have a question.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28549","Marshall","Yeah?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28550","Ted","What did Barney mean when he said ""calzone""?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28551","Marshall","Okay, I'll tell you. Okay. One time Barney saw me drop a calzone on the sidewalk, pick it up, and then keep eating it. It feels so good to finally say that out loud. I...","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28552","Ted","Dude. Listen to me. You have nothing to be ashamed of. That calzone sounds amazing.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28553","Lily","Guys, I found this on the floor.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28554","Ted","Oh, my God. Scooby ate the whole tray. Wait. Where is he, anyway?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28555","Lily","Scooby got out!","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28556","Nora","Here we are. I had a really great time tonight.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28557","Barney","Yeah, me, too.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28558","Nora","Do you want to come upstairs?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28559","Barney","I'd love to. (He kisses her) There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28560","Barney","Can you believe...","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28561","Lily","Oh, my God! I found Scooby's wallet.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28562","Marshall","Oh, no! That means the poor guy's out there with no identification.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28563","Ted, on the phone with Robin","Robin! Hey. Hey, um, remember Scooby? Uh, well, he got out.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28564","Robin","""Got out""? What do you mean?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28565","Ted","He just walked out of the apartment. Someone must've left the door open.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28566","Marshall","It wasn't me.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28567","Lily","Me neither. He must've figured out how to open it himself.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28568","Ted","He's so smart. We should get him on Letterman doing tricks.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28569","Marshall","I know Paul Schaffer's sandwich guy. This could happen.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28570","Robin","Guys. Get yourselves together and start looking for Scooby. I'm on my way home.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28571","Ted","Wait wait! Robin. Can you pick up some calzones?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28572","Barney","Wait... Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28573","Nora","Misled? You lied to me! You had your friends lie to me!","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28574","Barney","I was on the spot. This is your fault.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28575","Nora","My fault?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28576","Barney","Yeah, with the whole ""I want to get married"" thing. You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship. This... isn't England.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28577","Nora","Good-bye, Barney.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28578","Ted","Great idea.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28579","Marshall","No, great idea!","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28580","Lily","Okay. If you were new in town and had just ingested an eighth of sandwich, where would you go?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28581","Marshall","Of course. Back to the pizza place!","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28582","Ted","Yeah! Maybe that's where Scooby went.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28583","Marshall","Who's Scooby?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28584","Robin","Hey, have you seen Scooby?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28585","Barney","Uh, yeah. Isn't that him taking a leak on that fire hydrant?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28586","Marshall","Scooby!","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28587","Nate","Oh, hey! It's my friends!","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28588","The cardiologist","And that explains 12 51 a.m. Okay. None of this suggests a systemic issue. Your heart's fine. With a healthy diet, you can live a long and happy life. If nobody stabs you.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28589","Lily","Day's not over.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28590","Barney","Okay. Lily, I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28591","Lily","No, that wasn't the lie. The lie was when you told Nora you were lying. Because you weren't. You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28592","Barney","Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. 50 years from now, if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another... 32 years. I mean... Nora's great. She's wonderful. But...","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28593","Lily","What time was your dinner reservation?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28594","Barney","Last night? 8 30.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28595","The cardiologist","What did his heart do at 8 30? It... literally skipped a beat.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28596","Lily","Your heart's talking to you, Barney. Do you have the guts to listen to it.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28597","Barney","I lied.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28598","Nora","Barney.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28599","Barney","When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28600","Nora","I'm confused.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28601","Barney","So am I. This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but I know it's what I want. I want to be confused. With you.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28602","Nora","Mom, Dad... this is Barney.","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28603","Barney","Hi. I'm Barney. Great to meet you. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?","06","18","A Change of Heart"
"28604","Ted from 2030","Kids, I bought the house we live in now way back before I ever met your mother. It needed a lot of work, but I had a vision for it.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28605","Ted","Vintage rolltop desk here. I haven't decided whether to put the fern on the right or the left side, but you know, sometimes you just gotta wing it. Right? Left side. Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28606","Barney","Ted. This is your seduction lounge. s*x swing there, vibrating Jell-O pit right there, rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel right here. Don't ask; you're not ready. And that basketball hoop? Outdoor stripper pole. We'll just tell the ladies to be careful in the winter. You think a tongue stuck to a frozen pole is bad...","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28607","Marshall","Hey. Barney, let's go outside for a second.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28608","Lily","We have a confession. This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house. It's an intervention.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28609","Barney","Oh, thank God. I'll go first. Ted, this hous you bought for your hypothetical family is super weird. We talk about it all the time behind your back.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28610","Ted","Yeah. This intervention isn't for me. It's for you","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28611","Ted from 2030","Why did Barney need an intervention? It all started a few nights earlier.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28612","Marshall","Barney, I can't believe your giant TV is broken. It's March Madness.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28613","Ted","Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28614","Barney","Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28615","Lily","You call the super for a screwdriver?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28616","Barney","Yeah... here's the thing about me and tools... the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28617","Ted","Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28618","Barney","Well, here's our screwdriver now. (Barney opens the door, then whispers loudly ) Guys, I'm pretty sure that's not Luis, but I can't be certain. Someone introduce yourself.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28619","Jerry","Barney, I... I got your letter.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28620","Barney","Dad?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28621","Marshall","I can't believe Barney is talking to his dad right now.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28622","Robin","Yeah, what do you say after three decades of not seeing each other?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28623","Lily","""So, how 'bout those last 30 Super Bowls""?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28624","Ted","Okay, now I feel bad about making fun of him for the tool thing. My dad was the one who taught me all that stuff.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28625","Robin","Well, to be fair, everyone has some glaring gap in knowledge, something really obvious you somehow never learned.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28626","Ted","Okay, but a screwdriver? Come on, I don't have any gaps that fundamental.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28627","Robin","Really? I seem to recall...","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28628","Ted","Daniel Burnham was an architect whose ever-shifting style and aesthetic made him a true architectural chamma-leeon. And only the most gifted chamma-leeon could've designed classic beaux arts masterpieces right alongside sleek modern flatirons. His name might as well have been Daniel Chamma-leeon.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28629","Student","Um, Professor? Uh, do you mean ""chameleon""?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28630","Ted","Betty, I'm pretty sure it's pronounced ""chamma-leeon,"" so... Class dismissed. No homework. For a while.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28631","Ted","Okay, I learned that word by reading it. That's how I've always pronounced it.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28632","Robin","Ted, that wasn't easy. It took a lot of ""ch-aracter"" to admit that.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28633","Ted","Okay, Scherbatsky. You want to tussle? I'll tussle.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28634","Robin","You want to tussle? Let's tussle.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28635","Ted","Marine biologist.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28636","Robin","Please, no.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28637","Scott","So this really sucks, but I'm going to be in the North Pole for the next three months.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28638","Robin","Seriously? The North Pole? Okay, pal, if you want to break up with me, just tell it to me straight. Don't pretend you're going someplace we all know doesn't exist.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28639","Scott","Um, I'm going to be studying the mating habits of...","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28640","Robin","Of who? Santa's elves? Rudolph? You know what? I'm going on a trip, too, Scott. It, uh, starts in Narnia. It works its way up to Candyland, and then, hey, congratulate me, because I'm the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Expelliarmus!","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28641","Scott","Robin, the North Pole is a real place. You know that, right?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28642","Robin","So... you want to get pizza later? Or...","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28643","Scott","I think we should break up.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28644","Robin","I still think about him in the shower.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28645","Ted","Hey. Tell us everything. How'd it go, bud?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28646","Barney","Where do I begin?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28647","Jerry (Barney's dad)","So, I'm not sure how to start this.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28648","Barney","Yeah. I think I need a drink.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28649","Jerry","Me, too.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28650","Both","Glen McKenna, neat.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28651","Jerry","Nice order. Up top.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28652","Barney","Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is... this is going to take me a minute.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28653","Jerry","Yeah. I understand. By the way, hell of a tie. Is that Italian silk?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28654","Barney","I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28655","Barney","Make a muscle.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28656","Jerry","There you go.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28657","Barney","Ah!","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28658","Barney","Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28659","Barney","Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28660","Jerry","Not anymore. Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for The Stones through West Germany, and their tour manager loses his arms, bus-surfing through a tunnel. Gnarly. Long story short, I've been managing tours ever since, and that dude high-fives people with his face now.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28661","Barney, laughing","You're funny. My dad's funny.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28662","Barney","So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28663","Lily","Why did you abandon me?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28664","Marshall","Why'd you wait so long to contact me?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28665","Robin","You've hurt me before, why should I trust you now?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28666","Barney","Do you... get laid a lot?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28667","Jerry","Big-time. Observe.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28668","Barney","Oh, my God, that took you five seconds.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28669","Jerry","Oh, was it that long? Life's too short for chatty chicks.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28670","Barney","You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28671","Barney","...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28672","Jerry","So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow with Bon Jovi. I'll be on the road the rest of the year.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28673","Barney","Oh, that's cool.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28674","Jerry","Say, you want to join me for the tour's Asian leg?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28675","Barney","This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg. (both laughing)","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28676","Lily","Barney, we... we know you're psyched, but just... be careful.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28677","Barney","What do you mean?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28678","Ted","Well, this guy has flaked out on your whole life. It sounds like he just might be telling you what you want to hear.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28679","Robin","Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28680","Barney","First of all, Robin, my dad could beat up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me... I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28681","Ted","I hope Barney's dad isn't just pretending to be something he's not, you know?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28682","Lily","Yeah. That would make Jerry a real chamma-leeon.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28683","Ted","You have gaps, too, Lily.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28684","Lily","You got nothing on me.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28685","Marshall","Hey, Lily, can you toss me a beer?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28686","Lily","Sure, honey. (She throws the key toward the wall besides Marshall)","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28687","Ted","You have terrible aim.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28688","Lily","That's not true.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28689","Marshall","Lily, at our apartment, you're the one who pees on the floor.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28690","Robin","Oh, my God. Barney's dad.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28691","Jerry","Hey, uh, you're Barney's friends, right?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28692","Marshall","Yeah, but... aren't you supposed to be off managing some tour in Australia?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28693","Jerry","What? No, I... I'm a driving instructor up in White Plains. And I need your help... Barney won't return my calls.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28694","Lily","What do you mean, Barney won't return your calls? He said you two had an amazing night together.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28695","Jerry","That's not what happened.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28696","Barney","I'm not sure how to start this.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28697","Jerry","Yeah.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28698","Barney","I think I need a drink.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28699","Jerry","Me, too.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28700","Barney","Glen McKenna, neat.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28701","Jerry","Milk, skim.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28702","Barney","Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28703","Jerry","I'll say. Between you and me, I had a lot of acid last night.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28704","Barney","Wow.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28705","Jerry","I think it was the chili dog. I had to take four Tums. I was up till, like, 9 30.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28706","Barney","Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28707","Jerry","No. I switched lanes years ago. I should explain. I'm a driving instructor. Now you get it, right","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28708","Barney","Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28709","Jerry","Oh, I know. I was a real hard partier.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28710","Barney","Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28711","Jerry","The drugs, the alcohol, the women...","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28712","Barney","Yes, yes, yes.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28713","Jerry","I was out of control.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28714","Barney","*Out of control.*","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28715","Jerry","So when your mom said I couldn't see you any more, it was rock bottom for me. I'm so sorry.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28716","Barney","You ever bang Stevie Nicks?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28717","Jerry","Barney wasn't interested in my apology. He just wanted me to be cool. And I was so desperate to connect with him. I did something I'm not proud of. I started bragging.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28718","Jerry","I bet you didn't know this about me, Barney, but I've published two nonfiction books about asparagus. And one fiction. I'm credited with inventing the word ""furgling."" It means fumbling for keys. So then all the county fair judges started chanting, ""More quiche! More quiche!"" I guess you could call me the LeBron James of drapes.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28719","Jerry","I could tell he just wanted me to be this big ladies' man, so...","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28720","Jerry","What a hottie, huh? I'm sure you're a real player.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28721","Barney","Big-time.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28722","Jerry","Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28723","Barney","Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the ""Father Knows Breast,"" there's the ""Bush Dynasty,"" the ""Lick Father, Lick Son.""","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28724","Jerry","Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28725","Barney","Why?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28726","Jerry","I have a family now. That's my wife Cheryl, my daughter Carly... she's in college. This is my son J.J. I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28727","Barney","You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28728","Jerry","I made him wait all these years for me and... I'm just not the guy he wanted me to be. I know I don't deserve it, but... I need another chance to connect with my son.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28729","Lily","We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28730","Barney","What?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28731","Marshall","You're having dinner with him tonight.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28732","Barney","No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28733","Robin","Are you sure it's not more than that?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28734","Barney","Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28735","Marshall","No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28736","Barney","Fine, I'll go.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28737","Marshall","Awesome. Um, Lily, keys. (She throws them way too hard, they land in the trees) I'm literally 11 inches from you.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28738","Ted from 2030","And so Barney agreed to give his dad one more chance.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28739","Cherryl","Hello. You must be Barney. I'm Cheryl. It's just so nice to finally meet you. I love that suit.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28740","Barney","Oh, thank you very much. And I love your...coat. I love your coat.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28741","Cherryl","Oh, that's your coat, Barney. I just took it from you.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28742","Barney","Well, I do love it. It's doing a nice job covering up that chair.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28743","Lily","Guess now we wait.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28744","Marshall","Hey, I got an idea how to pass the time. A little trivia game. Robin, reindeer  real or fake?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28745","Robin","Okay, I'm not an idiot. Reindeer are obviously f... re... fake?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28746","Marshall","Yikes! I'm surrounded by a bunch of dum-dums. Good thing I don't have any gaps in my knowledge. I am perfect. Oh, for the love of God, guys, enough already.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28747","Lily","What, baby?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28748","Marshall","You've been treating me with kid gloves ever since my dad died.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28749","Robin","That's not true.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28750","Lily","Robin, don't disagree with Marshall.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28751","Robin","I'm sorry.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28752","Marshall","I first noticed it at the bar.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28753","Marshall","Hey, Lily, (his voice cracks) Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys. [...] The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28754","Barney","It ages well, that's the thing.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28755","Marshall","You guys like my new soul patch?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28756","Robin","Righteous hair tab, brotha.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28757","Marshall","And once I figured it out, I started doing crazy stuff to see how far you'd let me go. [...]Hey, guys. This is Rex. He's a possum. I found him in the trash. He lives with us now.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28758","Lily","I love him.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28759","Marshall","Lily, we are living with a possum. Rex is violent and he hates us.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28760","Lily","But, baby, you just lost your dad. None of us wants to upset you.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28761","Marshall","Please. If you guys really want me to get over the worst tragedy of my life, I'm begging you, tear me a new one. But not like Rex tried to in my sleep last night.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28762","Jerry","J.J., dinner. When I got your letter, I dug this up. You were probably too young to remember, but this is you, this is me, and, of course, ZZ Top.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28763","Barney","I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28764","Jerry","Yeah, I used to love taking you backstage. You were the coolest little kid.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28765","JJ","Hi, Barney. It's great to finally meet you.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28766","Barney","J.J., I'm talking to Dad right now. God.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28767","Marshall","Seriously, it's time. What are my gaps?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28768","Ted","Well, I guess maybe one gap you have is... you can't wink.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28769","Marshall","Don't you think that maybe we should go home and, uh, ""do the laundry""","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28770","Lily","You can't swallow pills.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28771","Robin","Ooh, ooh, I got one. You think John Kennedy and Jack Kennedy are the same person. (laughs) Right? What?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28772","Cherryl","So, Barney, I understand you have a pretty big job with a bank.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28773","Barney","Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28774","JJ","I'm 11.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28775","Barney","Oh, well, huh, now we all know you make excuses. I was talking about money.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28776","Cherryl","Actually, J.J. has a job. Tell him, J.J.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28777","JJ","I got a paper route.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28778","Barney","Good time to get into print media. Am I right, Dad?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28779","Jerry","Good slam, Barney.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28780","Cherryl","Jerry.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28781","Jerry","It's all good fun. Just ribbing among long lost brothers.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28782","Cherryl","J.J.'s a heck of a basketball player.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28783","Barney","Uh, you don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj. Dad, check it. Triceps. What gym do you go to?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28784","JJ","Fourth period?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28785","Barney","Sounds like you're having your fourth period. Am I right, Dad?!","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28786","Jerry","Got him again.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28787","Cherryl","Jerry!","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28788","Jerry","Oh, okay, Barney. Uh, maybe that's enough.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28789","Barney","Why? J.J. started it. What does J.J. even stand for anyway? J... Jerky... Jerkface?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28790","Jerry","J.J. stands for Jerome Jr.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28791","Barney","Jerome Jr...? Oh. He's... he's named after you. Excuse me.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28792","JJ","I like having a brother.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28793","Ted","You always add too much water to oatmeal.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28794","Marshall","Yes, I drown the son of a bitch.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28795","Robin","You consistently miss at least one belt loop.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28796","Marshall","It's like I'm blind.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28797","Lily","You're too old to ask to see the cockpit.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28798","Marshall","Whoa. Whoa. Guys, my dad just died.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28799","Lily","Aw, honey.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28800","Marshall","No, I'm just kidding. This is great. I really, I really missed this.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28801","Jerry","Barney, what is going on?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28802","Barney","This is mine.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28803","Jerry","I don't understand.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28804","Barney","J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28805","Jerry","Please, just come down and talk to me.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28806","Barney","Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28807","Jerry","Why does that make you so mad?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28808","Barney","Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?!","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28809","Jerry","Look, Barney, I know I screwed up...","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28810","Barney","Oh, ""screwed up"" doesn't even begin to describe...","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28811","Jerry","I know, I know, I know! I want to fix this, and I don't know how! Please, tell me what I can do! I'll do anything! You're never gonna get it down like that. Barney. Barney! Just put the pointy end into the grooves. That's it. Now turn it. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. I have no good excuse, Barney. It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down. It took courage to send me that letter. More courage than I've ever had. I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I... I just have no idea where to begin.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28812","Barney","Can you help me with this?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28813","Jerry","Here, got it. Look, if you... ever feel like you're ready, I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28814","Barney","Bye.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28815","Lily","Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28816","Barney","I'm fine. Hey, Ted.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28817","Ted","Yeah, buddy.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28818","Barney","You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there?","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28819","Ted","Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28820","Barney","No, you were right. A kid needs a hoop.","06","19","Legendaddy"
"28821","Ted from 2030","Kids, as you know, I was designing Goliath National Bank's new headquarters on the site of this old hotel, The Arcadian. Problem was, some people didn't want The Arcadian torn down. Even bigger problem, they were led by my girlfriend Zoey.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28822","Crowd","G-N-B is the e-ne-my!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28823","Zoey","(She sees Ted at the window) Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on! Hey, sweetie! Are we still on for dinner at 8 00 at Valenzisi's? That's great! I can't wait!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28824","Crowd","That's great. I can't wait! That's great. I can't wait!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28825","Ted from 2030","But somehow, Zoey and I were making it work.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28826","Barney","Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28827","Robin","Or maybe he was. Think about it. The way that she bats her eyelashes and shakes her tail feathers in his face? (chuckles) She wants it.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28828","Lily","Isn't it hard for you guys to be on opposite sides of something like this?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28829","Ted","Of course you feel that way, Lily. You and Marshall have basically melded into one big hermaphroditic blob. And that's fine for you guys. But some of us want a partner who challenges us to grow and evolve.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28830","Lily","You guys are in screaming matches all the time.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28831","Ted","Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Growing matches.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28832","Ted from 2030","It was true. Zoey and I loved to challenge each other.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28833","Ted","The main character is a young spoiled prince thrust into leadership after the death of his father. It's obviously a modern-day retelling of Henry IV!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28834","Zoey","Are you kidding me?! It's Don Quixote...the classic quest story with the hero-jester and his long-suffering manservant!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28835","Ted","Okay, clearly, when we're watching Tommy Boy, we're watching two different movies.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28836","Ted","No, you hang up.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28837","Zoey","No, you hang up.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28838","Ted","No, you hang up.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28839","Zoey","No, you hang up.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28840","Ted","No, you hang up! (Later) No, you hang up.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28841","Zoey","No, you hang up.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28842","Ted","No, you... (His phone starts beeping) Hold on. (beep) Hello?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28843","Robin","For the love of God, will one of you idiots hang up the phone?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28844","Ted","Why would you do that?!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28845","Zoey","I-I thought you'd like it.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28846","Ted","Who likes that?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28847","Zoey","I like it.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28848","Lily","Your relationship sounds exhausting.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28849","Ted","Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28850","Lily","Marshall and I have been together 15 years, and the only debate we've had about Tommy Boy is whether it's awesome or super awesome. That's love, bitch.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28851","Ted from 2030","Now around this time, Marshall had truly come to hate his job. He hated the paperwork. He hated the coffee. He hated the dirty jokes. He hated everything.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28852","Marshall","I have to quit.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28853","Barney","Quit GNB?! Why?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28854","Marshall","I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species...","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28855","Barney","Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28856","Lily","Baby, you have my full support.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28857","Barney","Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning. (Barney snickers) Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28858","Robin","I don't think you know what Spain is.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28859","Barney","Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28860","Ted","It's dinero.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28861","Barney","Where? I want his autograph!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28862","Ted from 2030","So Marshall walked in the next morning all ready to quit. But then something weird happened. Suddenly, he didn't hate the paperwork. He didn't hate the coffee. He didn't even hate the dirty jokes. Out of nowhere, Marshall actually liked GNB.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28863","Robin","It's graduation goggles.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28864","Marshall","What?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28865","Robin","Graduation goggles, like with high school. It's four years of bullies making fun of all the kids with braces, even after the braces come off and they can walk just fine. But then, on graduation day, you suddenly get all misty because you realize you're never going to see those jerks again. I just had graduation goggles with that guy Scooby I dated.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28866","Lily","The guy who was basically a dog?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28867","Robin","He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful. (as speaking to a dog)  He was a good boy.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28868","Barney","Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having s*x with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28869","Robin","The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28870","Marshall","You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28871","Barney","No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28872","Lily","Baby, more than ever, you have my full support. (Lily and Marshall kisses)","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28873","Ted","You know, sometimes I feel bad for Lily and Marshall.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28874","Lily","I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28875","Barney","It starts with an... ""L?""","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28876","Girl","How can you not remember my name?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28877","Ted","It's like they never challenge each other. They just automatically agree all the time.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28878","Zoey","Well, they don't do that all the time.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28879","Ted","Yes, they do.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28880","Zoey","No, they don't.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28881","Ted","Yes, they do. It's like they...","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28882","Lily and Marshall","... don't see eye-to-eye on anything! Totally.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28883","Girl","It rhymes with your name.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28884","Barney","And I said my name was...?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28885","Marshall","Baby, I did it! I quit. And then I walked right over to the NRDC, and I took that job.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28886","Lily","Oh, good for you, sweetie.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28887","Marshall","Yeah. It's a little less money than I was expecting. I mean, compared to what I was making at GNB, it's nothing. Actually compared to anything, it's nothing. It's nothing. The paid position just got filled, so all I can do is-is volunteer right now. You're cool with that, right?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28888","Lily","Baby, if this is what you need to do, we'll figure it out. How's Barney handling you leaving?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28889","Ted","Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play ""Who's Hot and Who's Scott?""","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28890","Barney","It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall-... ruined everything.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28891","Ted","Oh, come on. Everything's not ruined.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28892","Man","Guys, everything's ruined.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28893","Ted","What? Why?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28894","Man","Your girlfriend somehow got the Landmark Preservation Committee to agree to a hearing. If they declare the Arcadian a landmark, the whole project is dead. The good news is, I just got the phone number of a husky-voiced hottie in a turtleneck.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28895","Robin","...so, if the Landmarks Preservation Committee sides with Zoey, your whole project goes down the tubes? You must be furious.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28896","Ted","I'm furiously enjoying being challenged.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28897","Lily","Why don't you admit that your girlfriend challenging your every move is getting you a little murder-suicidey?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28898","Ted","Why don't you admit that Marshall quitting his job and taking an unpaid internship is killing you?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28899","Lily","It's not.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28900","Ted","Lily, the downside to having giant, Japanese anime eyes is that they're easy to read. And yours are screaming, ""What about my trip to Spain, deadbeat?""","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28901","Lily","Okay, Ted, the downside to having a woman's mouth is, your feminine pout gives away your true feelings. And yours is saying, ""Oh, Zoey, why can't I be on top just this once?""","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28902","Ted","We take turns! Sometimes.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28903","Marshall","Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28904","Barney","I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28905","Robin","Hershel?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28906","Barney","What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28907","Lily","Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28908","Barney","There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28909","Marshall","Barney, I'm not playing...","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28910","Barney","Just come back to GNB already!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28911","Marshall","I'm really loving my new job.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28912","Lily","Oh, and I'm loving seeing you this happy.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28913","Marshall","I'm so glad to hear you say that because I volunteered our apartment for a big NRDC fund-raiser tomorrow night. You're-You're cool with that, right?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28914","Lily","Baby, you have my full support.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28915","Marshall","Thanks, baby. (phone chirps) Oh. Ooh, I gotta go. The invitations are ready. The party's for a bunch of environmentalists, so I found a guy downtown who makes biodegradable party invitations that can also be used as toilet paper.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28916","Barney","That's how I'm gonna use mine.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28917","Robin","Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28918","Barney","Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28919","Robin","Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28920","Barney","Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. ""Barney, we have to talk about your father."" ""Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil."" ""Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session ""between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute."" I don't need this!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28921","Ted","Ah, Lily Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple! I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks. One  your mom didn't seem to mind it last night on her...","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28922","Lily","Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right? (Ted says something in spanish) Perfect. Let's go.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28923","Barney","Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28924","Marshall","Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28925","Barney","Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28926","Robin","(Robin is standing at the door) Oh, my God!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28927","Barney","How long have you been there?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28928","Robin","You don't remember?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28929","Robin","Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28930","Barney","Oh, no, I'm fine.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28931","Robin","Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28932","Barney","Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28933","Robin","Yeah.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28934","Barney","Right. So, um... Chinese?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28935","Ted","You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Marshall doesn't make us a worse couple.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28936","Lily","You're right. I-If you and Zoey are happy, then who am I to judge? I'm so sorry.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28937","Ted","Oh, my God, is that how support feels? It's so warm and wonderful. Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28938","Lily","But I thought you liked being challenged.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28939","Ted","Nobody likes being challenged! Couldn't she agree with me just once, even on something little, like... like what movie to see or-or what topping to get on our pizza or... oh, I don't know, my lifelong dream of building a skyscraper in New York City?!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28940","Lily","Well, in her defense, hamburger pizza, Ted? What are you, 12?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28941","Ted","You were right, Lily. I mean, Zoey's great, but... sometimes I do wish we were a little more like you and Marshall. There he is. Here we go. (Ted says some incomprehensible things in spanish)","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28942","Man","I'm sorry. I don't speak... whatever it is you're speaking.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28943","Ted","Um, he speaks perfect English.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28944","Lily","Yeah, I-I know.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28945","Ted","Then why did you ask me to come?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28946","Lily","So you can drive him to the fund-raiser. Supporting Marshall this much is driving me crazy. I'm going to Spain-- my flight leaves in 45 minutes. Adios, muchacho.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28947","Ted","W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28948","Lily","You were right. If I hear myself say ""Baby, you have my full support"" one more time, I swear I'm gonna murder someone!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28949","Ted","What are you gonna tell Marshall, huh? And when are you coming back?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28950","Lily","I honestly haven't thought it all the way through, and I don't intend to. All I know is that I'm a ticking time bomb, and if I don't do something for me right away, I swear I'm gonna explode!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28951","Ted","Wow, tha... that's an evocative metaphor to use for your nonthreatening, totally patriotic emotions. U.S.A.! Okay, Lily, I get it.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28952","Lily","Marshall's been asking a lot lately.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28953","Ted","But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28954","Lily","I've never been good at that. And now, ever since his dad died, I-I feel like it's my job to just be fine with everything. But I'm not. I'm not fine that he volunteers our apartment for a giant fund-raiser and that he's not thinking about how we're gonna pay any of our bills and that, apparently, we've given up on trying to have kids.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28955","Ted","Lil...","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28956","Lily","Look, I'm sorry, Ted, I just, I gotta do this. (Lily leaves)","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28957","Man","My bag? Oh, no. I got it.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28958","Barney","There's nothing to talk about.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28959","Robin","You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28960","Barney","I don't want to talk about it, okay?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28961","Robin","Why not?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28962","Barney","Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28963","Robin","I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... (quietly)  ticking.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28964","Barney","That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28965","Robin","No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28966","Barney","Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28967","Robin","Huh?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28968","Barney","It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28969","Barney","Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28970","Marshall","Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28971","Barney","I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28972","Barney","...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted. (quiet sobbing) You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28973","Robin","What is wrong with you?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28974","Marshall","Hey, Professor Rodriguez, thank you so much for coming.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28975","Prof. Rodriguez","Oh, my pleasure. I have to use the restroom. Do you have some extra invitations?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28976","Marshall","Right over there. Enjoy. Hey. Hey, thanks for picking him up.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28977","Ted","Yeah, absolutely. Um, listen, something happened at the airport. Um...","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28978","Marshall","What?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28979","Ted","Well, we got there, and, uh, Lily...(sighs) Lily...","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28980","Lily","Marshall, hey. Sorry, I, uh, I had to park and-and grab some ice. Sorry.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28981","Marshall","Oh, thanks, babe. You would not believe how much this one has done to help throw this party, Ted. I don't know how she does it. Can't be easy, huh, Lil?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28982","Lily","Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I-I need to talk to you about something.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28983","Marshall","No, you know what? Me, too. Um... I want to thank you for being so supportive of me in all this. I've been at the NRDC for less than a week, and I've already done more to be proud of than in two years at GNB. I can't believe how good it feels. But now, it's time for me to find a way to help the Earth and get paid for it, because I can't put that burden entirely on you. So, starting tomorrow, I'll look for something with a paycheck. What do you think?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28984","Lily","Baby, you have my full support.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28985","Zoey","Ted.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28986","Ted","Hey! What are you doing here?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28987","Zoey","This is really important to Marshall, so I came to show my support.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28988","Ted","This you can be supportive of?!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28989","Zoey","What is that supposed to mean?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28990","Ted","I have the chance to build a skyscraper in the best city on Earth, and who's the one leading the charge to kill that dream? My girlfriend!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28991","Zoey","Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about my lifelong dream of not seeing every beautiful building in Manhattan bulldozed?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28992","Ted from 2030","And in that moment, I realized, though I really cared about Zoey, I couldn't do this for the next 50 years. I had to break up with her. But then... Kids, some couples always support each other, and some couples always challenge each other, but is one really better than the other? Yes. Support is better. Way better. But I'd have to learn that the hard way.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28993","Lily","You're too young. This isn't fair.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28994","Marshall","We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28995","Barney, weakly","Thank you, Marshall. (coughs weakly) Marshall... can I ask one final favor, my friend?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28996","Marshall","Yes, of course, of course... anything.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28997","Barney","Eat this meatball sub.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28998","Marshall","Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"28999","Barney","I don't have much time!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"29000","Marshall","Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"29001","Barney, with a mean laugh","I'm not sick, you idiots! I've racked up $30,000 of uninsured medical bills for symptoms I don't even have. Totally worth it! You should see the look on your face. Oh, wait, you can't-- 'cause it's covered in marinara sauce!","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"29002","Ted","Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas.","06","20","The Exploding Meatball Sub"
"29003","Jerry","Barney, afraid this is good-bye. Your buzz kill of a ma... thinks I'm a... a bad influence on you.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29004","Barney","What? That's... What is that word you taught me? ""Bull"" something?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29005","Jerry","But she's your mother and I'm... you know, I'm just your Uncle Jerry. So, this is the last time I can see you.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29006","Barney","But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be... Led-and-Jerry.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29007","Jerry","Sorry, buddy, but this is it. But don't you forget your training. What's a magician's best friend?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29008","Barney","A drunk audience.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29009","Jerry, laughing","Attaboy. You still got that button from the festival we went to? Now... I'm gonna put this right inside your brain, behind your ear... so that I'll know that you won't forget me. See you, buddy. And hey... Never... stop... partying.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29010","Ted from 2030","Kids, in 1983, Barney watched his father walk out of his life. And in 2011, when their first reunion ended badly...","06","21","Hopeless"
"29011","Jerry","I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29012","Ted from 2030","This time it was Barney who did the walking.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29013","Barney","Bye.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29014","Ted from 2030","And that was almost the end of it. Except, a few weeks later...","06","21","Hopeless"
"29015","Barney","I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29016","Marshall","Mmm. Your dad?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29017","Barney","My dad!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29018","Barney","Barney Stinson.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29019","Jerry","Hi, Barney. It's your dad. Look, would you like to go fishing with me and J.J. on Sunday morning?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29020","Barney","Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29021","Jerry","Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... ""Crazy Jerry""? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29022","Barney","You do not know how right you are.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29023","Barney","Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29024","Ted","You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29025","Barney","I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29026","Robin","Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29027","Barney","Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29028","Barney","Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29029","Lily","That's why you brought these guys.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29030","Barney","No. That's why I brought these guys. (He gets several cards out of his inside pocket) I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29031","Marshall","Improvements?!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29032","Barney","Yeah.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29033","Marshall","Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29034","Barney","Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29035","Lily","Whoo-hoo!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29036","Marshall","Gross!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29037","Barney","Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself. (chuckles) Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29038","Ted","Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, ""Man is least himself when he talks...""","06","21","Hopeless"
"29039","Barney","Ted, card.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29040","Ted","Ah. You're right... ""No quoting Oscar Wilde.""","06","21","Hopeless"
"29041","Barney","Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29042","Robin","Aw, man! Why?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29043","Barney","I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh... (chuckles) no, thanks.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29044","Lily","Hey, Barney... love the new identities. Little thing... instead of being a naked super ninja, can I be Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29045","Ted","How good was that movie?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29046","Barney","And... hence new identities.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29047","Ted from 2030","And so Barney's dad finally showed up.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29048","Barney","Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29049","Marshall","Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29050","Barney","Lily, his wife.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29051","Lily","Well, most nights. Mama don't let no ring get in the way of a good time.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29052","Jerry","That's... a little depressing.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29053","Ted","Uh, hi again. Ted. Oh, and, Jerry, you remember my girlfriend.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29054","Robin","Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29055","Barney","Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29056","ROBIN","Two, three, four!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29057","Jerry","So, Saturday night... time to cut loose, right? Who wants to split a beer?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29058","Barney","Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong...","06","21","Hopeless"
"29059","Marshall","Um, those places shut down a long time ago.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29060","Barney","Oh, no.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29061","Marshall","Oh, No shut down, too.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29062","Ted","There's Where?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29063","Jerry","Where's Where?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29064","Lily","Where's where Was was, isn't it?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29065","Barney","No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29066","Jerry","Okay.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29067","Ted","Not Okay. That place is lame.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29068","Robin","Okay is Lame? I thought Lame was a gay bar. Or is that Wrong?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29069","Marshall","That's wrong. That's not Wrong.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29070","Barney","Guys, focus.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29071","Robin","Oh, I like Focus. Let's go there.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29072","Ted","Where?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29073","Robin","Not Where. Focus.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29074","Lily","I thought Focus was closed.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29075","Barney","No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29076","Marshall","So Closed is open.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29077","Robin","No, Closed is closed.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29078","Jerry","I don't know. Third base! Right?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29079","Robin","Ew, Third Base is all frat guys.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29080","Jerry","I'll go anyplace, okay?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29081","Ted","Not Okay. Okay is lame.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29082","Robin","Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29083","Lily","Guys, shut up.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29084","Barney","No, Shut up shut down. I can't believe I don't know the clubs anymore.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29085","Marshall","Guys, just pick a club, okay?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29086","Ted","Not Okay!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29087","All","Okay is Lame! Gay bar.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29088","Marshall","For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Lamé.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29089","Barney","It's hopeless, isn't it?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29090","Marshall","Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29091","Barney","I know. Daddy's home. And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29092","Jerry","I might be allergic to this stamp.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29093","Robin","Oh, my God, my secret crush is here.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29094","Lily","Mila Kunis?!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29095","Robin","No, my secret crush. We met a few years ago.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29096","Man","Hi. I could use a woman's opinion. Is this working for me?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29097","Robin","Uh... no. (laughs) The only good thing about how ugly that shirt is, is that it distracts from how terribly it fits you.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29098","Man","I was trying on the pants.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29099","Robin","Oh. (Laughs)","06","21","Hopeless"
"29100","Robin","I had to leave before we could finish talking, so that was it. You know, ever since then, I've always... Oh, my God, he's coming over here. Oh. Hello.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29101","Man","Hi. A few years ago at a department store... did you embarrass the hell out of me?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29102","Robin","Oh, I'm sorry, you must have me confused with the shirt you were wearing that day.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29103","Man","I should be so lucky.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29104","Ted","Hi! I'm Ted! Robin's boyfriend! Nice to meet you.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29105","Man","Right. Um... it was really nice to see you again.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29106","Robin","Mm-hmm. You, too.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29107","Man","Yeah.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29108","Ted, whispering to Robin","You owe me one.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29109","Barney","Man, isn't this place great?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29110","Jerry","Uh, I don't know. It's so loud!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29111","Marshall","And so bourgeois. Many of plays are about the bourgeois. And ennui. And one rock opera about... a frozen yogurt shop.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29112","Barney","Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk about your open marriage.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29113","Lily","Okay. Well, after a long day of style meetings and photo shoots and being way too mean to my assistant, I sometimes bang an underwear model.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29114","Jerry","My goodness!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29115","Marshall","I sleep around, too. Just as much. A little more, even.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29116","Lily","Oh, uh, only 'cause you have nothing to do all day.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29117","Marshall","Are we having this fight again? Writing plays is a real job!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29118","Lily","I work 90 hours a week subsidizing your ""real job.""","06","21","Hopeless"
"29119","Marshall","I won a Tony!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29120","Lily","I brought French cooking to America!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29121","Marshall","What?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29122","Barney","Let's do shots.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29123","Jerry","Uh, no, thank you, Barney. I have that fishing trip with J.J. early tomorrow. I... I better take it easy.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29124","Barney","No. Don't you remember what you said to me when I was a kid? ""Never stop partying.""","06","21","Hopeless"
"29125","Jerry, looking horrified","I said that? To a six-year-old? I don't remember that.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29126","Barney","You don't remember the last thing you said to me when I was a kid? Well... you know, why don't you just go back home?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29127","Jerry","But I want to hang out with you.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29128","Barney","Yeah, well, I want to hang out with Crazy Jerry, not Stay-at-Home Jerome.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29129","Jerry","Fine. You want Crazy Jerry? (He drinks four shots) There! You got him! I apologize... it might take a few minutes to kick in.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29130","All","Oh...","06","21","Hopeless"
"29131","Jerry","Hey, sugar! Five beers for the table, a Seven-and-Seven for me, and your ten digits for this guy here! Tonight Crazy Jerry's gonna burn this disco down! Whoo! Wa-hah!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29132","Barney","Can you believe it? This is awesome!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29133","Robin","Barney, how is that awesome?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29134","Barney","I finally know what it's like to be embarrassed by my dad.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29135","Marshall","So you really believe that if we were in an open marriage that you would do better than me?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29136","Lily","Hey, you do better than me at a lot of other things, like digesting dairy... and reaching for stuff.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29137","Marhsall","Okay, you know what? Game on. If I can score five numbers before you can, then we have s*x in the bathroom. But... if you can score five numbers before me, then we have s*x in the bathroom.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29138","Lily","So our usual wager. Deal.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29139","Barney","Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y... you really want to be out here like this?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29140","Jerry","Oh, sorry, small-town preacher from the Midwest, is there a law against dancing?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29141","Barney","No, of course not. I... I just...","06","21","Hopeless"
"29142","Jerry","Oh, this club blows. Let's hit the greatest party in the world, the streets of New York!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29143","Barney","Yeah! Let's do it! Uh, maybe fix the tie. But mostly, party!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29144","Robin","Okay, Jerry's gone; Let's break up.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29145","Ted","Okay. ""I would have stolen you a whole orchestra."" There. What's the rush?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29146","Robin","Well, that guy who came over here who thinks we're dating, I kind of have a crush on him. Can you help me clear it up?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29147","Ted","Really? That guy? He was, like, a four.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29148","Robin","A four? God, you are, like, the worst judge of guys ever. Okay, if he is a four, what are you?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29149","Ted","Hey! I'm not perfect; I'm an eight... and a half.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29150","Robin","You're a doofus and a half.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29151","Ted","Fine. Let's go talk to him. Where'd you meet this booger-eater anyway?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29152","Robin","At a close-out sale at Dawes.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29153","Ted","Really? I remember that sale.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29154","Ted","Hey, Robin.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29155","Robin","Oh, Ted. Oh, no.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29156","Ted","Look what I just bought. Right? Right? (He is wearing the Red Boots)","06","21","Hopeless"
"29157","Ted","Hold on. We were dating then. I specifically remember, because we had great s*x that night. Great s*x.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29158","Ted","Let me guess. Someone wants to knock... boots. Boots. (imitating gunshots)","06","21","Hopeless"
"29159","Robin","Just take off your damn shirt. Okay.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29160","Ted","All right.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29161","Robin","All right. Whoa, stop.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29162","Ted","What?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29163","Robin","Stop. Perfect.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29164","Ted","But I... I can't see, and you can't see me.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29165","Robin","Yeah. Yeah, just like that.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29166","Ted","You were picturing your crush!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29167","Robin","Well, somebody had to.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29168","Ted","Okay, okay, answer me this. Are you absolutely sure it had nothing whatsoever... to do with the boots?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29169","Robin","Yes.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29170","Ted, loudly","You hear that, everybody? She said ""yes""! We're getting married! (Ted chuckles) I love this girl. I'm never letting her go.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29171","Jerry","Hey... Bottoms up, amigo!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29172","Ted from 2030","After that, Barney's memory of the night got a little hazy.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29173","Jerry, to a big tattoed biker","You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy! You don't even know!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29174","Barney","(laughing)  Hey, hey! There we go!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29175","Jerry","Oh, look what I just ripped out of the ground!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29176","Barney","Oh...!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29177","Jerry","I just puked on the hood of that... police car! (Laughing)","06","21","Hopeless"
"29178","Jerry","Too bad your playwright friend isn't a lawyer. Barney, I'm so sorry. I'm afraid this is what it's like hanging out with Crazy Jerry.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29179","Barney","It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So... next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special...","06","21","Hopeless"
"29180","Jerry","Oh, for corn's sake, Barney, I'm not drunk!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29181","Barney","What?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29182","Jerry","I told you, I don't party anymore, and you wouldn't take no for an answer. So... I used a little... sleight-of-hand... to make you think otherwise.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29183","Jerry","Here you go.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29184","Barney, laughing","Whoa!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29185","Jerry","Bottoms up, amigo!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29186","Barney","But all those crazy things you did.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29187","Jerry","Do you happen to remember what a magician's best friend is?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29188","Barney","A drunk audience.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29189","Jerry, to a dummy wearing a biker outfit","You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29190","Barney","No, no, no. You don't even know! Right here!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29191","Jerry","Look. Look what I just ripped out of the ground!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29192","Barney","Oh...!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29193","Barney","What just happened?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29194","Jerry","I... I just puked on the hood of that... (siren blares)...police car.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29195","Barney","Well, why do all those things?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29196","Jerry","I figured if I showed you what... ""never stop partying"" really looked like, you'd realize you can't do it forever. (sighs heavily) Oh, well.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29197","Barney","You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy...!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29198","Jerry","I wanted to hang out with you... you're my son. And since you didn't want to come with me and J.J. On that fishing tri... Fishing trip. I'll never make it back in time now.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29199","Barney","Hey, you know, a... a pretty good magician like you probably knows how to, say, get out of a standard set of handcuffs.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29200","Jerry","Perhaps.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29201","Barney","Well, here's something you didn't know... I'm a pretty good magician, too. (They escape and run away) Abracadabra!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29202","Woman","Congratulations!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29203","Robin","Oh, hey! Thank you so much. We're super excited. We're thinking June. (laughs) Yeah, okay. Okay, jerk, do you remember how you ended up buying those red cowboy boots?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29204","Ted, chuckling","Wow. Wardrobe malfunction at the O.K. Corral! I mean, who in their right mind would ever...","06","21","Hopeless"
"29205","Woman","You would look so totally hot in those.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29206","Ted","Do you have these in a size 11?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29207","Robin","So get off the field at the Superdome, because you ain't no saint.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29208","Marshall","Hello.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29209","Robin","I, uh... Oh.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29210","Marshall","Hi, Robin. Could I have your phone number?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29211","Barney","We need someplace to hide.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29212","Jerry","Where?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29213","Barney","No, Jerry, this is not the time to go to another club! We've got to get you back home in time for that trip. But there's no more trains, there's no cabs.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29214","Jerry","Well, uh... I do have a few driving students in the city.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29215","Barney","Step on it! Jerry...","06","21","Hopeless"
"29216","Jerry","Do not step on it.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29217","Barney","Jerry, we have got to get you home in time for that fishing trip.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29218","Jerry","The laws are there to protect...","06","21","Hopeless"
"29219","Barney","This is no time for laws!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29220","Jerry","Buckle up, Barney.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29221","Barney","I am not going to buckle up!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29222","Jerry","I am your father! You will listen to me!","06","21","Hopeless"
"29223","Ted","Hey! How's the open marriage going? Who was the first one to get the five numbers?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29224","Lily","I won that race. My prize... s*x in the bathroom.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29225","Marshall","And I won that race.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29226","Lily","Aw, sorry that secret crush didn't work out for you.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29227","Robin","Oh, it's okay. I guess it just wasn't meant to be.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29228","Lily","Why are you smiling?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29229","Robin","I don't know. Good night.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29230","Man, on the phone","Saw that girl again. And guess what? She's engaged. So that's the end of that.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29231","Ted from 2030","It wasn't the end of that. More on that later","06","21","Hopeless"
"29232","Man","And her fiancé? The guy's like a two.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29233","Barney","How did you do it?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29234","Jerry","Do what?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29235","Barney","How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but... I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs...","06","21","Hopeless"
"29236","Jerry","You're drifting.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29237","Barney","Hey, I'm trying to open up to you...","06","21","Hopeless"
"29238","Jerry","No, Mrs. Perkins, you're drifting! Go on, Barney.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29239","Barney","When I think about going for anything more than that, I look at my life, and who I am, and... I'm too far gone. I'm broken.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29240","Jerry","Son, I was far more broken than you'll ever be. And look at me now. Don't get me wrong... settling down is... a challenge. It's the biggest challenge of your life.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29241","Barney","So how do you do it?","06","21","Hopeless"
"29242","Jerry","A magician never reveals his greatest trick. But I'll give you a hint. You gotta meet the right girl. Who knows? Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29243","Barney","Maybe I've met her already.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29244","Jerry","And park. And emergency brake. I did have a good time tonight. And hey, if you want to go fishing, we got room in the boat.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29245","Barney","Maybe some other time.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29246","Jerry","Okay. Oh, and, uh... thanks for taking such good care of this. It means a lot to me that you kept it safe all these years.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29247","Barney","I'm going fishing with my dad.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29248","Barney","This... sucks.","06","21","Hopeless"
"29249","Ted from 2030","Kids, when your Uncle Marshall finally quit Goliath National Bank to do something better with his life, he left on great terms with his boss.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29250","Arthur","Good luck, Marshall. And promise you'll list me as a reference.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29251","Ted from 2030","Which made Marshall's big interview with a respected environmental organization all the more confusing.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29252","Head of the environmental Organization","I'm sorry. I don't think you're the kind of person we're looking for. I just got off the phone with Arthur Hobbs over at GNB.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29253","Arthur","Oh, yeah, I worked with Marshall Eriksen... at least I did when he actually showed up.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29254","Arthur","Marshall! Hey, it's, uh, it's 2 30. If it's no big deal, we'd sure love it if you'd try to get here at least before lunch.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29255","Marshall","Yeah? And I'd sure love to give a rat's ass.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29256","Assistant","Oh! Mr. Eriksen... You're not wearing any pants.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29257","Marshall","Your move.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29258","Assistant","But Marshall, wh... What about the environment?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29259","Marshall","Screw the environment!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29260","Head of the environmental Organization","""Screw the environment""?!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29261","Arthur","Oh, yeah. We fired him when we caught him clubbing a seal in his office with an even cuter seal. The guy's a maniac. He's just an awful, flatulent racist.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29262","Marshall","Sir, none of that is...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29263","Head of the environmental Organization","Sorry. Interview over.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29264","Ted from 2030","And so Marshall stormed over to GNB, where he ran into Zoey.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29265","Zoey","If you want to get back at those jerks, I have a proposition for you.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29266","Barney","Invitations for the demolition of The Arcadian. As head of the project, I get to decide how we knock it down. I'm torn between training an actual coyote to use an ACME dynamite plunger, or hooking up a fuse to Eddie Van Halen's guitar that goes off the second he hits the last note to ""Hot For Teacher."" Barney! Barney! Bar... No, no. I'm going to go coyote.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29267","Robin","Wait. While no one wants to see a, uh, coyote wearing a little hard hat more than me, remember  Zoey's protest could still shut your whole project down.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29268","Barney","Oh, come on. Zoey's not shutting anything down, standing out there with her stupid megaphone, screaming in the wind; butt cheeks trembling with fury; her perky breasts heaving; her self-righteous nipples...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29269","Ted","Dude, that's my girlfriend.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29270","Barney","Point is, we are taking her and The Arcadian down. Am I right, Teddy Westside?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29271","Ted","You know it.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29272","Lily","Okay. See, that's so weird to me. One second you're defending Zoey, and the next, you're talking about her going down.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29273","Barney","Glad to know she's also mouthy in a good way. What up? Dude, that's his girlfriend.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29274","Lily","Isn't it tough dating the woman that's trying to prevent your building from being built?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29275","Ted","At first, yes, but we figured out a great way to deal with it  we never talk about it. And since then, we've really been enjoying each other's company.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29276","Lily","So, every time The Arcadian comes up, you guys just awkwardly change the subject?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29277","Ted","Yeah, but you'd be surprised. It doesn't even come up that often.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29278","Zoey","Hey, guys.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29279","All","Hey!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29280","Zoey","Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29281","Ted","So Oprah's retiring. Oof! What's that world gonna be like?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29282","Robin","Wait, Marshall's helping you save The Arcadian, now.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29283","Zoey","Yeah. Having a former GNB employee on our side is huge for us. GNB is going down.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29284","Marshall","Yeah, totally.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29285","Ted","So, they found water on Mars. What?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29286","Marshall","Listen, um, I hate to go up against my two best friends, but... I really, I really need this right now. I mean, we're, we're cool, right?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29287","Barney","Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29288","Lily","That was on purpose!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29289","Barney","I mean this is really like...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29290","Marshall","Barney, please...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29291","Ted from 2030","And thus began an all-out war between Barney and Marshall...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29292","Delivery Guy","Delivery from Mr. Stinson.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29293","Zoey","Barney sent us pictures of himself. Oh, God. What's he doing to that megaphone?!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29294","Marshall","Oh! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29295","Ted from 2030","Later, back at the bar... another war was just beginning.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29296","Lily","Babe, can I get you a drink?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29297","Marshall","No, I'm still not... ready to put my mouth on anything yet.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29298","Lily","I know.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29299","Marshall","You know what? Screw this. Game on.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29300","Lily","Can you believe this one? Wants our booth. Keeps giving us the walk-by.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29301","Robin","That bitch is not giving us the walk-by.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29302","Lily","The walk-by with the stink eye.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29303","Robin, in a high-pitched voice","A stink-eye-walk-by?! Aw, hell no! I hope this drink isn't teething, 'cause it's about to get nursed.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29304","Marshall","Barney! Your wife just called from the hospital! It's a boy!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29305","Barney","No. I' was... I was...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29306","Ted from 2030","This went on for days.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29307","Marshall, to the girl Barney is talking to","Congratulations. You're about to be the 250th girl that Barney has slept with.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29308","Barney","Pfff. Try 283. 250 was months ago. No, no, no. No, I mean, you're totally 250, baby. No, don't. (The girl leaves)","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29309","Marshall","Oh, bye-bye.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29310","Marshall","Mr. Stinson... I had to rush down as soon as I got your results. I'm sorry, but your crabs have super-herpes. (The girl leaves in a hurry)","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29311","Lily","Oh, boy. Look who's back.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29312","Robin","Look, Lily, I think this girl wants our seats. Should we leave... or stay here Lionel Richie style ""All Night Long""?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29313","Lily","Excuse me waitress, I'll have a mojito! And you'll have a no-seat-ho.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29314","Marshall","Ah, yes... the sweet, smoky taste of victory.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29315","Barney","Are you sure it doesn't taste like anything else?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29316","Marshall","That's it!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29317","Barney","Kent! Kent!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29318","Marshall","Oh, God! Ow... Why would you do that to your own jacket?!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29319","Barney","That's what you get, you traitor!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29320","Marshall","Oh, really? Really?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29321","Barney","Yeah. Really.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29322","Marshall","Really. That... what...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29323","Carl","Okay, enough! You guys are out of here.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29324","Robin","Ejected!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29325","Carl","I meant all of you. You're all banned from the bar. Out!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29326","Robin","Carl! Oh... This has nothing to do with us. You're totally ridiculous. (The girls stand up and leave the booth; the other girl sits down at their booth) Don't look, baby. Just don't look. Come on.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29327","Lily","This stupid feud isn't going to end until Marshall and Barney finally talk about their feelings, cry, and then hug it out like they do on Oprah.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29328","Robin","Man, what are we going to do without her?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29329","Lily","Oh...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29330","Robin","Wait, you know what, these guys are not going to get all mushy sober. We need to get these bitches drunk.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29331","Lily","Yes, but the right kind of drunk. Uh... we should go with something mellow. Maybe red wine?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29332","Robin","Oh, I don't know. Red wine has kind of an odd effect on Barney. He reaches a point of sad clarity.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29333","All","Ten, nine, eight...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29334","Barney","I'm a B-plus. My whole life, I was hoping to be an A, and I'm a B-plus. And I'm okay with that.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29335","All","Happy New Year!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29336","Robin","If we want them to open up, I say we go straight-up gin.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29337","Lily","Oh... last time Marshall got gin-drunk was at that douchey bar Barney likes to go to. Marshall almost got in a fight that night.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29338","Marshall","Look at this meatball. He's headed right towards me, showing me no respect. Well, if he wants to play chicken, this rooster ain't backing down! Oh. Mirror.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29339","Lily","How about martinis?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29340","Robin","Absolutely not. I'm not going anywhere near you and a martini.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29341","Lily","Why not?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29342","Lily","Ooh... You know what would be stupid? If we made out. That would be so stupid. Hey, I dare you guys to dare us to make out.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29343","Robin","Every time.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29344","Lily","I only say that because it would be so stupid if we did. So stupid...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29345","Robin","Uh-huh.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29346","Lily","Oh, yeah? Well... what about you and absinthe?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29347","Marshall","I don't know. We could have water, soda, purple stuff...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29348","Robin","We're a dream a baby's having. We're a dream a baby's having.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29349","Lily","I keep telling you, that didn't happen.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29350","Robin","It happened, and it changed me. How about daiquiris?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29351","Lily","Maybe. When Marshall has daiquiris... he gets really into how beautiful he is.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29352","Marshall, talking to a mirror","Hey. I dare you guys to dare us to make out.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29353","Ted","Hey, Marsh, you know that's another mirror, right?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29354","Lily","Peppermint schnapps?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29355","Robin","No. Peppermint schnapps turns Barney into Richard Dawson.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29356","Lily","Who?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29357","Robin","The crazy old host of Family Feud, who greeted women by kissing them on the mouth.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29358","Barney","Hey there, darlin'. How you doin'? Ah, is this your sister? Mmm... Beautiful. Mmm...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29359","Ted","Hey, where are our chicken wings?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29360","Barney","Show me chicken wings!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29361","All","Good order, Ted! Good order!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29362","Ted","Okay, I'm gonna go pick up Zoey, then we're off. See you Sunday.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29363","Lily","Oh, wait, Ted. Do you have a specific reaction to any kind of alcohol?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29364","Ted","Bourbon. When I drink bourbon... I get weirdly good at beatboxing.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29365","Ted","Peace, I'm out.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29366","Lily","Yeah, Ted, I hate to tell you, but the bourbon only makes it sound good to you.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29367","Ted","Peace. I'm out.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29368","Ted","You had to take that away from me, didn't you? (He takes a bottle of Bourbon out of his bag and put it on the table)","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29369","Robin","Well, enjoy Martha's Vineyard. Hopefully by the time you get back, we'll be allowed back into MacLaren's.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29370","Ted","What do you mean?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29371","Lily","Barney and Marshall's feud got us banned from the bar. We lost our booth.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29372","Robin","Stop.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29373","Ted","Man, how did things get so screwed up?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29374","Ted from 2030","Of course I knew the answer to that. I was dating her. But I wasn't about to ruin our first big romantic weekend away by bringing up the one topic we agreed was completely off-limits.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29375","Ted","You and The Arcadian are ruining my life! What?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29376","Zoey","I thought we weren't talking about...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29377","Ted","We're talking about this. Look, I can handle you trying to prevent me from fulfilling a life-long dream. That's just being in a relationship. But now? You turn my best friend against me?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29378","Zoey","Marshall made his own choice. Why aren't you mad at him?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29379","Ted","Because he's going through a lot right now. He, he's looking for something to believe in, and you took advantage of that. You're, you're just like those Internet swindlers who tricked him into paying 300 bucks for a lock of Sasquatch fur.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29380","Zoey","You cannot compare The Arcadian to a Ziploc bag full of Turkish armpit hair. The Arcadian is a beautiful, magnificent hotel.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29381","Ted","Okay. You know what? We're settling this once and for all.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29382","Zoey","Okay.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29383","Lily","We've cross-referenced every alcohol with Marshall and Barney's reaction. What's the right drink for this situation?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29384","Robin","Well, they're not talking. They're not even looking at each other. That reminds me of those awkward Sunday dinners with my mom, my dad and his mistress. Families, right?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29385","Lily","I-I guess. That... seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29386","Barney","Do you know what I had to do to get you that job?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29387","Marshall","Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29388","Barney","What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29389","Marshall","I showed up with wet hair once! Once!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29390","Barney","Oh, my God.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29391","Ted","Well, here we are. I had a reservation at a four-star inn overlooking the ocean but, uh... How can that compete with such a beautiful, magnificent hotel? Welcome to The Arcadian. So here's the deal. If you can last until sunrise in your precious Arcadian, I'll join your side.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29392","Zoey","You're on. This place is fantastic. They even left a chocolate on the pillow.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29393","Ted","That's not a chocolate.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29394","Robin","Okay, now we need to get them something that will make them emotionally vulnerable and completely, pathetically honest.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29395","Lily","Yeah, we need a drink that, that takes subtext and turns it into text. Yeah.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29396","Marshall","See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation. That's why The Arcadian speaks to me.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29397","Barney","Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29398","Marshall","Oh God, I didn't even think of that...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29399","Barney","It made me wonder, ""What could I have done to make him stay?""","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29400","Marshall","Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29401","Barney","That's what everyone keeps saying but people just keep leaving me.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29402","Robin","Wow. That got real o'clock.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29403","Lily","Yeah. We need to get them up and having fun.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29404","Robin","Dance, my puppets, dance!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29405","Lily","Now do you see why I'm always interfering in other people's lives?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29406","Robin","Oh, God, totally!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29407","Zoey","Well, we're here for the night. Might as well have some fun. Dare to join me?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29408","Ted","Dust just flew out of that comforter in the shape of a skull. Whoa, something just passed through me. Can you get STDs from the ghost of a prostitute?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29409","Ted","What are... What are you doing in our bathroom?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29410","Woman","This bathroom for entire floor!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29411","Lily","Okay. Final round. What simple act will get the boys to finally forgive each other?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29412","Robin","Sharing a brandy. Which is what I walked in on my parents doing once. Brandy was my father's mistress. God, parents. Right?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29413","Lily","Again, just a whole other thing, sweetie. Where'd they go? Oh, no. They did shots.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29414","Robin","What? What is it?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29415","Lily","What's the worst thing they could possibly drink right now?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29416","Barney","Your place or mi... Your place or mi... Le-Let's go to your place. Mm.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29417","Ted from 2030","Kids, don't drink tequila.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29418","Ted","Uh, these were supposed to be for a romantic dinner on our balcony as we were serenaded by the sounds of the ocean. But I guess we'll have to settle for what sounded like two very large men having s*x next door... with a third very small man.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29419","Zoey","I think that small man sounded very moved by The Arcadian's beauty.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29420","Ted","Okay. What is it? And don't give me, ""It's beautiful."" Don't give me, ""It's magnificent"" What is it about this place that makes you so passionate to save it?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29421","Zoey","Well... When I was a little girl... my family used to live here.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29422","Ted","Why, why have you never told me that?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29423","Zoey","I never told anyone that. It makes it sound like it would be impossible for me to be objective, but... The truth is, I... I loved growing up here. We had just moved to New York. We were completely broke. But my mom told my sisters and me that The Arcadian was a castle. And we believed her. I know it's not what it used to be... but this building is a part of who I am. And that's why I want so badly for you to like it, too.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29424","Ted from 2030","Kids, you never forget the first time or place you tell a girl","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29425","Ted","I love you.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29426","Zoey","I love you, too.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29427","Carl","Come on in, you're un-banned. I gave these guys some drinks and they calmed down and made up.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29428","Robin","Well, what drink finally did the trick?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29429","Robin & Lily","Of course, beer.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29430","Marshall","I love you.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29431","Barney","I love you.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29432","Barney","Uh, no. N-Not right...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29433","Ted","You know, I guess this place isn't so bad.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29434","Zoey","See? With a little renovation, we could restore it to its former... What was that?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29435","Ted","What was what?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29436","Zoey","I think it went under the bed.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29437","Ted","I don't see anything.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29438","Zoey","That, that was... that!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29439","Ted","Oh, my God! It's the cock-a-mouse!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29440","Zoey","The what?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29441","Ted","Cock-a-mouse. Part cockroach, part mouse. It used to live in our apartment. It must have settled here, and... Oh! Look, it had babies! Good for it.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29442","Zoey","Ew.... I give up. You win. Let's go!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29443","Lily","Be well, my friends! Aw, just how we left them.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29444","Robin","Morning. Who wants breakfast?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29445","Barney","You have some coffee? So I can throw it in this traitor's face?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29446","Marshall","Oh, yeah? Hey! Hey! Do you guys have some pancakes, because I... would really like some pancakes. They're fantastic. Let's be honest, I love them. But I hate this guy!","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29447","Lily","I thought they made up last night.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29448","Robin","Damn it, I know what happened.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29449","Marshall","I love you.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29450","Barney","I love you. Uh, no. N-not right...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29451","Lily","Carl, a round of champagne.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29452","Lily","Ooh! The champagne.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29453","Robin","We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29454","Barney","What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29455","Ted","Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29456","Barney","Whoa, whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Ted...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29457","Robin","Okay, what drink can fix this?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29458","Lily","Mama's done with this drama. What drink can fix the headache these clowns are giving me?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29459","Robin","I got it.","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29460","Robin","Right?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29461","Lily","Time is music the planets make. Music the planets make...","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29462","Woman","What is that?","06","22","The Perfect Cocktail"
"29463","Ted from 2030","Kids, this is a story of landmarks. There are certain moments in life when you have to decide which things you can stand to see torn down, and which things you have to preserve, no matter what. Such a moment came for all of us in May of 2011, at a special meeting of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, where the fate of The Arcadian would be decided once and for all.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29464","Marshall","A symbol of strength and constancy, the stone lion of The Arcadian has watched over New Yorkers for generations. So remember  if the lion head stonework is regal, then tearing it down should be illegal. Well. Did you like that? All right, uh... We must make sure the lion is always there. Destroy The Arcadian? Oh, no, don't you dare. Yeah? Yeah? Okay. Try this one on for size... If you want New York's history at your beck and call...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29465","Chairman","All right, thank you, Mr. Eriksen.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29466","Marshall","I just have...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29467","Chairman","We will now hear from the architect of the proposed GNB Tower, Ted Mosby. Now, uh, Mr. Mosby, let's just cut right to the chase. Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?...Okay, it's killing me. What rhymes with ""beck and call?""","06","23","Landmarks"
"29468","Marshall","Wrecking ball. Don't go swinging no wrecking ball.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29469","Audience","Ah...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29470","Marshall","Thank you.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29471","Chairman","Mr. Mosby, do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? It's not a difficult question.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29472","Ted from 2030","Actually, it a difficult question. Of course, had he asked me a few days earlier, I would have immediately said...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29473","Ted","""Yes. The Arcadian should be a landmark."" And then the crowd gasps  ""Oh, my God! Did he really just say that? Oh, heavens! Oh, my stars! I must clutch my pearls!""","06","23","Landmarks"
"29474","Zoey","So these things are generally attended by old Southern ladies?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29475","Ted","Almost exclusively. But here's my point  If they ask GNB's chief architect... aka me... if The Arcadian should be a landmark, and I say ""yes""?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29476","Zoey","That, no, that wasn't The Arcadian being destroyed; that was GNB's hopes of destroying The Arcadian.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29477","Marshall","I'm sorry, I should have been more clear.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29478","Zoey","Yeah. The Arcadian's gonna be all like...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29479","Marshall","Nice.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29480","Robin","I have a message from Barney.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29481","Ted from 2030","Things between Barney and the rest of us had gotten a little frosty. First this happened.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29482","Zoey","Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29483","Ted from 2030","And then this happened.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29484","Zoey","What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead, sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?!","06","23","Landmarks"
"29485","Ted","Dude! That's my girlfriend. And ya know what? I'm on her side now, too.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29486","Ted from 2030","Which led to this happening.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29487","Zoey","Message from Barney? That's my cue to leave. Good night, guys. I love you.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29488","Ted","Mmm. Love you, too.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29489","Lily","All right, what's the message? 'Cause if it's another hypothetical yet eerily accurate drawing of my boobs...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29490","Robin","Yeah, I have that, too.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29491","Lily","Damn it.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29492","Robin","All right, here's the message. (clears throat, then reads Barney's note) ""Oh, hey, guys. Didn't see you there. I was too busy feelin' fine and..."" Really? ""Feelin' fine and gettin' some 'jine. You may have noticed the giant plate of hot wings in front of me. I know how much you love hot wings. Too bad someone bribed the kitchen to take them off the menu tonight. So, if you want some, you're going to have to come back to GNB. But hurry, this offer will be gone lickety-split. (Barney licks his hot wings peace by peace then throws them down) Do evil laugh."" Oh, um... (makes a poor impression of Barney's laugh) So, what are you turds up to?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29493","Marshall","Oh, we've got the big LPC meeting in two days. I have my whole presentation worked out. I just need to find a good rhyme to end on.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29494","Ted","Why does it need to rhyme?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29495","Marshall","If you end an argument with a rhyme, it's convincing all the time.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29496","Lily","Yeah. It's why in our apartment  If you're a-hopin' to score, don't leave your socks on the floor.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29497","Marshall","And she hasn't since.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29498","Barney","Okay, okay. A couple of things. Lily, how'd I do?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29499","Marshall","Nailed it.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29500","Barney","Secondly, Ted, I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey. Are you really going to walk away from this project just because you're mad at me?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29501","Ted","It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been dead for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29502","Barney","I understand. Zoey has magic lady bits.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29503","Ted","What?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29504","Barney","Zoey's lady bits... are magic, and that's how she controls your mind. You see, every few hundred millennia, lady bits leap forward...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29505","Lily","I know you're only just getting started, but this is already gross.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29506","Barney","I once knew such a girl.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29507","Barney","It was last call. In this very bar.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29508","Barney","What...?! No... What?!...No... What?!","06","23","Landmarks"
"29509","Robin","Um... thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29510","Ted","Barney, this is about the building.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29511","Barney","Come on. This is so about the girl.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29512","Ted","Okay, fine. It's about the girl! I am doing this for Zoey! I'm in love with her. Look, I know it's early, but there is a very good chance Zoey might be the mother of my children. So, in addition to doing this for John Clifford Larrabee, I'm also doing this for Luke and Leia.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29513","Lily","Wait. She's gonna let you name your kids Luke and Leia?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29514","Ted","Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't. Barney, I'm sorry.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29515","Barney","Oh, you're not sorry now, Ted Mosby. But you will be. You... will... be. (laughing harder and louder) That's how you do an evil laugh. Ciao for now.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29516","Ted from 2030","Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs, Barney and Marshall's old boss at GNB? Well, Arthur was going through a divorce and taking it kind of hard.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29517","Barney","Hi, Arthur. Everything okay?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29518","Arthur","No, everything's not okay. My stupid wife got custody of Tugboat. God, I should have kept her hidden in a cage in the basement.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29519","Barney","Isn't that animal cruelty?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29520","Arthur","I'm talking about my wife.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29521","Barney","Oh. That's fine, then. So listen, you know Ted, the architect?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29522","Arthur","Yeah, I know your friend Ted.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29523","Barney","So, if Ted stood up at that big meeting tomorrow and said that he thought The Arcadian should be a landmark... You wouldn't just fire him, would you? (laughing uncomfortably) Right? You wouldn't just... You wouldn't just... yeah...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29524","Arthur","No, Barney. I wouldn't just fire him. I'd also fire you.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29525","Barney","Come again for Big Fudge?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29526","Barney","Can you believe that?! I can't be unemployed, Robin! My job is my identity; It's who I am. It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29527","Robin","I-I don't understand. Why would he fire you?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29528","Barney","I don't understand. Why would you fire me?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29529","Arthur","Have you already forgotten how Mosby got that job?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29530","Barney","By being the best architect available?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29531","Arthur","No.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29532","Barney","By... being Latino?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29533","Arthur","No. Let me refresh your memory. We were in this very room.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29534","Barney","Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, fire me.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29535","Barney","Damn it! I was kidding?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29536","Barney","I'm not kidding! Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29537","Arthur","Really good. In fact, I just put all my assets in her name. Smartest thing I've ever done.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29538","Both","Damn it!","06","23","Landmarks"
"29539","Arthur","No, you'd better make sure Mosby doesn't screw up tomorrow. Because either that building is going down, or you're going down.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29540","Ted","They're going to fire him? That sucks. He loves that job.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29541","Marshall","And he's been doing it for years.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29542","Lily","Okay, what does Barney do at GNB?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29543","Ted","No idea.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29544","Marshall","He has a lot of keys.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29545","Robin","Okay, Ted, can you just please think about this before you...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29546","Ted","There's nothing to think about. I-I can't lose Zoey. That's the only thing that matters to me right now.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29547","Robin","Okay, Ted... you know I love Zoey. But, look, sometimes... I go play chess in the park. And the key to chess... Okay, I play online. But the key to chess... Okay, it's Angry Birds! But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29548","Robin","The chairman asks you...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29549","Chairman","Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29550","Robin","You say...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29551","Ted","No.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29552","Robin","And Zoey dumps you on the spot.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29553","Zoey","We're done here.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29554","Robin","There's the second scenario.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29555","Robin","The chairman asks you...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29556","Chairman","Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29557","Robin","You say...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29558","Ted","Yes","06","23","Landmarks"
"29559","Robin","And you're happy for, like, a second, until you realize the building you helped save has just become a monument to everything this woman made you give up, and you resent her for it, so much so, in fact, that you dump her.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29560","Ted","We're done here.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29561","Ted","You said there was a third scenario.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29562","Robin","Right.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29563","Robin","The chairman asks you...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29564","Chairman","Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29565","Robin","But before you can answer...You're hit in the neck with a blow dart fired by the ninja Zoey's ex-husband hired to assassinate you.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29566","Robin","That one's less likely. What I'm saying... what I hate saying... is this. You and Zoey are gonna break up. But you can still save your career and Barney's.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29567","Ted","Okay, first of all, no ninja's getting a jump on me. I have the reflexes of a jungle... (Robin slaps him by surprise)","06","23","Landmarks"
"29568","Lily","Tree?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29569","Ted","Second of all, I don't care that the odds are stacked against us. I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey than spend the rest of my life alone playing Angry Birds, which, by the way, I've shown you how to download, like, 20 times.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29570","Lily","I've got to say, I'm with Ted on this.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29571","Ted","Thank you.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29572","Lily","I mean, yes, this is a huge, divisive issue for them. Which means no matter what happens, there's gonna be a lot of resentment. Probably lasting for years... infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship. So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29573","Robin","Thank you.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29574","Ted from 2030","That night, as I slept soundly...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29575","Ted","Barney, what are you doing?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29576","Ghost","Who is this Barney? My name is John Clifford Larrabee, architect of The Arcadian. And I am visiting you in a dream...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29577","Ted","Really? 'Cause it feels more like my insane friend renting a costume and breaking into my apartment in the middle of the night for what I wish I could say was the first time.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29578","Ghost","Look, it's a dream, it is. So just... okay? Theodore... heed my words  do not try to save The Arcadian.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29579","Ted","Barney, there's condoms in the drawer. Just take them and get out.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29580","Ghost, shouting dramatically","I am not... Barney...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29581","Ted","Whoa! Lighting change!","06","23","Landmarks"
"29582","Ghost","Theodore, you know The Arcadian is a badly built, architecturally unimportant rat's nest designed by an overpaid, plagiarizing ether addict with two thumbs. This guy.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29583","Ted","Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building, but... does that mean we have to knock it down? I mean, it's not bothering anyone. Just anyone who lives in it... Or looks at it... Or smells it.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29584","Ghost","New York is never finished, Theodore. She's a lady only a handful of architects ever get to dance with. Do not miss your turn.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29585","Ted","The Arcadian has to go, doesn't it?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29586","Ghost","Indeed.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29587","Ted","You realize this kind of screws up my personal life.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29588","Ghost","Mo' buildings, mo' problems.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29589","Ted","This is a dream, right? Because, Barney, I swear to God, if that's you...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29590","Ghost","Mommy's got Magic Lady Bits, Ted.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29591","Ted, panting","Dream! Dream! It was just a dream. (He takes his breath again, then phones Zoey) Hey. I know it's late, but, uh... you want to meet up?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29592","Zoey","Hello, Mr. Lion.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29593","Ted","""Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair""""","06","23","Landmarks"
"29594","Zoey","Hey, I met you right...(laughs)...here.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29595","Ted","Right. And I mistook you for a prostitute right... here.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29596","Zoey","As far as you know, I still could be one. And you, my good man, have run up quite a tab.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29597","Ted","Worth every penny.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29598","Zoey","All right... this was fun. I'm gonna take this cab. Big day tomorrow. We need to get some sleep. And yet...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29599","Ted","No, we should get some sleep. But this was fun.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29600","Zoey","Yeah. It's nice getting one last look to remember what we're trying to save.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29601","Ted","Exactly.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29602","Zoey","You okay?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29603","Ted","Yeah. Good night.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29604","Chairman","Mr. Mosby, I'm going to ask you one last time. Should The Arcadian be a landmark?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29605","Ted","No, it shouldn't be a landmark. There are a lot of important buildings in New York. The Arcadian isn't one of them.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29606","Zoey","E-Excuse me, I have a question for Mr. Mosby. If he doesn't think The Arcadian's worth saving, then whose voice is this? (She plays a recorder)","06","23","Landmarks"
"29607","Ted, on recorder","The Arcadian should be a landmark. It should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of... wieners and gonads.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29608","Chairman","Is that your voice, Mr. Mosby?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29609","Ted","Yeah, that's me.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29610","Ted","This is a nightmare. I can't believe she kept that tape. The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow, and based on today...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29611","Robin","They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29612","Ted","Yeah.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29613","Barney","We'll end up out of a job, all thanks to some stupid, only sort of awesome lion head.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29614","Marshall","Better get used to that lion head. As of tomorrow, it's gonna be there till the end of times. And all because of my sweet, sweet rhymes.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29615","Ted","What are we gonna do? We should buy a bar.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29616","Barney","We should totally buy a bar!","06","23","Landmarks"
"29617","Marshall","We should absolutely totally buy a bar!","06","23","Landmarks"
"29618","Robin","It's really the only sensible idea right now.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29619","Marshall","Oh, oh, and ready? It's a theme bar. It's a courtroom.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29620","Ted","Yes! Where the bartenders wear sexy judges' robes.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29621","Marshall","I'll allow it!","06","23","Landmarks"
"29622","Barney","The only court where you show up, then get served.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29623","Robin","Ho! You're judged by a jury of your beers.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29624","Ted","That's not bad.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29625","Lily","Just stop it! No one's buying a bar. Right now we have a little problem. Let's just think of a solution.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29626","Ted","Lily, it's over. The good guys lost.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29627","Marshall","I don't know, homegirl is pretty diabolical. If there is a plan that'll get us out of this, it's somewhere inside this butter churn. She'll think of it. I'm just gonna sit here... and watch it happen. (Lily starts to jiggle) And she's got it! Lily, what's the plan?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29628","Barney","Oh, this ought to be good.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29629","Ted from 2030","And then Lily told us her plan.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29630","Barney","Oh, this is good!","06","23","Landmarks"
"29631","Ted","We have to find Arthur right now.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29632","Arthur","What is so difficult about this?! Tugboat figured this out in, like, five minutes. This is bush league!","06","23","Landmarks"
"29633","Barney","Hey, Arthur!","06","23","Landmarks"
"29634","Robin","Oh, cute dog!","06","23","Landmarks"
"29635","Arthur","No! Tugboat, my other dog, that was a cute dog. This little disappointment is nothing but a cheap facsimile. I said it! Yeah, my love is reserved for dogs that go to the bathroom on command instead of wasting my time!","06","23","Landmarks"
"29636","Barney","Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea for how we can save, not saving The Arcadian.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29637","Arthur","Oh, his wife has an idea. Let me tell you about wives, okay? They leave you and take your best friend with them. You're not Tugboat! You'll never be Tugboat!","06","23","Landmarks"
"29638","Barney","Uh... Hey, Arthur?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29639","Arthur","I guess this one's kind of cute or whatever. So... so what's the idea?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29640","Lily","Okay, first hear my demands. One, Ted and Barney keep their jobs. Two, when you guys do finally blow up The Arcadian, one of them gets to push the button.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29641","Barney and Ted","Dibs.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29642","Arthur","Fine! What's the idea?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29643","Lily","Well...","06","23","Landmarks"
"29644","Ted from 2030","Kids, for legal reasons, I have to skip this part of the story and jump ahead to the next night, as the Landmarks Preservation Commission gave their verdict.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29645","Chairman","Last night, this committee took a vote, and while we have all felt from the very beginning that The Arcadian is, well, an eyesore... Mr. Mosby's surprising testimony about the lion's head stonework left us no choice but to declare it... a landmark. But then, something else happened last night. That same lion's head stonework...disappeared. So... that makes our job a little easier. Motion denied.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29646","Ted","Zoey... Zoey!","06","23","Landmarks"
"29647","Zoey","All right, what do you have to say for yourself?","06","23","Landmarks"
"29648","Ted","I don't know. Sometimes... things have to fall apart to make way for better things.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29649","Zoey","We're done here.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29650","Ted","Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore. You may now say what you really think of Zoey.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29651","Barney","I don't know, she may have been right about that lion's head. It gave The Arcadian a regal elegance. Then again, it goes really nice with my duvet. (He takes out a normal size screw driver) I hope I used the right screws.","06","23","Landmarks"
"29652","Ted from 2030","Kids, in the spring of 2011, Zoey and I broke up. But the good news  Goliath National Bank was finally ready to demolish The Arcadian and build the new headquarters I'd designed for them. (A committee, including Ted holding a big pair of scissors, is standing behind a red ruban. Ted is going to cut it, when a very happy Barney arrives with a bigger pair of scissors and cut the ruban before Ted can) The only problem was... I kept butting heads with my project supervisor on one very important issue.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29653","Ted","I want to press the button to blow up The Arcadian!","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29654","Barney","I want to press it!","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29655","Ted","I want to press it!","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29656","Barney","I want to press it!","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29657","Robin","Guys, I dated you both, and neither of you is good at pressing or even finding the button. After some awkward pawing around, that building's going to fake an implosion, say, ""Baby, that was great"""" and go to sleep.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29658","Both Ted and Barney, at the same time","She means you. I want to press it! I'm gonna press it!","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29659","Robin","It's just a button, okay? Can we just talk about something else, please?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29660","Ted","Well, I ran into Zoey yesterday.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29661","Robin","That's the first time since the breakup. How's she doing?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29662","Zoey","I'm still unemployed, so I had to get a couple roommates.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29663","Ted","Saving money. Making new friends. No downside.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29664","Zoey","They're all 22 and sell drugs. Which means they're not taking them. So, that's a win.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29665","Ted","Well, I can tell you're really busy so I should... I'll let you go.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29666","Zoey","Hey. You want to get coffee sometime?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29667","Robin","You know that ""coffee"" is code for ""I want to get back together"" right?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29668","Ted","Well, at first I wasn't sure, but then she said something that got me thinking.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29669","Zoey","I want to get back together.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29670","Ted","Don't worry, we're not. I just, I feel bad Zoey's having such a hard time.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29671","Barney","You know what might... make you feel better, buddy?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29672","Ted","I'm not letting you press the button.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29673","Barney","I want to press the button!","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29674","Ted","You're not pressing the button! It's my button!","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29675","Ted from 2030","Sadly, that's all you need to know about my summer. Now, around this time, Uncle Marshall was still having a tough time finding a job.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29676","Lily","He's out printing out a whole new batch of résumés because he misspelled the phrase ""detail-oriented."" And when he gets back home, he is going to find his favorite soup there waiting for him.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29677","Robin","Oh, that's sweet, Lil, but didn't you guys get food poisoning here one time?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29678","Lily","Three times. But they're really nice about it. Their policy is, ""Get sick, get a free gallon of soup"".","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29679","Ted from 2030","And so, Lily dropped off Marshall's surprise soup and headed back to work to introduce the new class pet.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29680","Lily","This is Mr. Buttons 2. Now, after what happened to Mr. Buttons 1, we have to be very gentle with... (Lily throws up onto Mr. Buttons 2. She leaves the shool, running to her apartment in order to stop Marshall from eating the soup) Marshall! Don't eat the soup! Oh, thank God.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29681","Marshall","This was about to be my third bowl. Why shouldn't I eat the soup? Why shouldn't I eat the soup?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29682","Robin","Hey, Mr. Architect, big day for you tomorrow, huh?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29683","Barney","Yeah. Getting to stand next to me while I press the button. That is going to be legend... wait for it...dary adjacent. Legendary adjacent!","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29684","Robin","You okay?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29685","Ted","Yeah... no. This morning I was talking to the foreman.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29686","Foreman","Hey, hotshot.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29687","Ted","You know, Rod, um, I'm loving that nickname, and I can tell it's totally affectionate, but, uh, I'd prefer Ted.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29688","Rod","Yeah, but you're such a hotshot, I figured I'd just call you hotshot. Pick one. And make sure you like it. There's going to be 50,000 of these in your big, hotshot building, hotshot.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29689","Ted","50,000 lightbulbs! What if this one's too bright? What if this one flickers and gives everyone a weird headache? Do you know how many people it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29690","Barney","Are these people Irish, Polish, blondes... what are we dealing with here?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29691","Ted","There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29692","Barney","Not possible. Your building is new. And I have one rule  New is always better.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29693","Ted","You can't keep saying you have one rule if they're always different rules.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29694","Barney","Ah, but ""new is always better"" is my oldest rule, which makes it the best.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29695","Ted","Hi, Marsh.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29696","Barney","Oh, hey, buddy.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29697","Robin","Hey. Everything okay?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29698","Marshall","Lily got food poisoning from some soup. And then I ate the soup exactly three hours later. Which means I can see exactly three hours into my future, and it... doesn't... look... good. I tried to be supportive.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29699","Lily","Oh, baby, can you just hold me, please?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29700","Marshall","Of course, baby. (He hesitates, then put one finger onto her back)","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29701","Marshall","But it doesn't help it that when Lily gets going; she sounds like a velociraptor from Jurassic Park. But then I realized a man can do a lot of living in three hours. So, I'm out experiencing this beautiful, crazy dance called life. Ah, my last meal. MacClaren's famous jalapeno poppers. My doctor says I need to eat healthier, so I figured the round-trip flight these babies are about to take will land them permanently on the no-fry list. Good-bye, my friend. It's been a hell of a ride. I have to...","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29702","Marshall","Hey, babe. The gang says feel better.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29703","Lily","Mm. Thanks. Wait, you didn't tell them I had food poisoning, did you?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29704","Marshall","Um, I...","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29705","Lily","Marshall, when it's stomach stuff, you just say ""under the weather,"" or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29706","Marshall","I know. I just said that you had the sniffles. No one is picturing anything but little red-nosed you under a blankie with some hot tea.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29707","Barney","I wonder what end it's coming out of Lily right now.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29708","Robin","I bet it's her tushie.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29709","Barney","I bet it's both. Hey, speaking of explosions... enough already, Ted! That button's mine!","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29710","Ted, while texting on his phone","Yeah, fine, okay.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29711","Barney","I got you this job, so I... Say what?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29712","Ted","Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run. (Ted leaves the Bar)","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29713","Barney","You...","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29714","Marshall, picking up his phone","Hello?... Yes, it is. (To Lily) It's Bloom, Greenberg and Associates. They want me to come interview. (Lily throws up) I know it's risky to go, but this is the best environmental law firm in New York. It's my dream job. (Lily throws up) That's a great idea, babe. I'll ask them. (In his phone) Hey, is it at all possible, could I come in on Monday?... Okay, I'll, I'll see you at 5 00. (Marshall hangs up) Thank you. I love and believe in you, too, baby.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29715","Robin","Why would Ted just give up the button like that? And he forgot his phone. ""See you in an hour.""","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29716","Barney","Who's that from?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29717","Robin","Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her!","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29718","Barney","Why would Ted get back together with Zoey? He's doing great.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29719","Robin","After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29720","Barney","No, I refuse to believe that Ted is getting back with Zoey because of lightbulbs.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29721","Robin","Uh, Ted's gone back for less.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29722","Ted","Hi, Natalie. You want to get coffee sometime?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"

"29724","Barney","Ted, I only have one rule.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29725","Ted","But I can't reach the worst part. (He picks his phone and calls someone) Hi, Karen. Want to get coffee sometime?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29726","announcer","Coming up next, our two local pandas, Ming Ming and Bao Bao, are expecting a baby.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29727","Ted","Robin, you want to get coffee sometime...?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29728","Robin","Get it together, bro.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29729","Marshall","According to my calculations, at 6 00 p.m., my body is gonna pay out like the most disgusting slot machine in the world. That gives me two hours to go do the interview and still get back in time.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29730","Lily","Oh, but, baby, what if you hit the jackpot early?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29731","Marshall","Don't worry. I'll be prepared.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29732","Neighbor","I'm talking your ear off, sorry. Is there anything I can do for you, sweetie?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29733","Marshall","Can... I... borrow... an adult diaper?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29734","Barney","We've got to stop Ted. Where are they meeting?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29735","Robin","Okay, Zoey wrote, ""Meet me at 6 00, where it all began, where you gave me the orchid at the intersection.""","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29736","Barney","Well, that's good. All we have to do is think back to the time Ted told us about his first date with Zoey.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29737","Ted","Amazing first date with Zoey! We met at the intersection... (The rest is unintelligible)","06","24","Challenge Accepted"

"29741","Barney and Robin","Lily!","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29742","Lily","Yeah, I wasn't listening, either. Ted really can go on about a bitch.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29743","Robin","Great. He could be anywhere. We're flat out of clues.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29744","Lily","Hey, wait. Ted left a message. I could hear it 'cause I was in the bathroom... blowing my nose... I have the sniffles.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29745","Ted's voice","Hey, Lily, hope you're feeling better. Marshall told us you're exploding from both ends like a busted fire hydrant.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29746","Lily","Damn it, Marshall.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29747","Ted's voice","Anyway, listen, I was going to get back together with Zoey today, but I came to my senses on the way out here, so... False alarm... Oh, crap. Just stepped in some gum. I'm getting back together with Zoey!","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29748","Robin","Okay, we're never gonna find him.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"

"29757","Marshall","Hello, hi.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29758","Jake","Hey. Oh, I'm sorry about the stench. We're suing a factory that's been dumping raw sewage into a local marshland. Yeah, ten minutes ago, I was knee-deep in liquefied human feces. And that was just on the F train.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29759","Robin","I can't believe Ted's getting back together with Zoey.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"

"29763","Barney","Yeah, almost as bad as us.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29764","Robin","We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29765","Barney","What about me? I got so fat, at the end of a date, you'd unhook my bra.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29766","Robin","You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29767","Barney","Thank God we're not sentimental saps who panic and get back together. Seriously, why would people do that?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29768","Robin","I guess I get it.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29769","Barney","What do you mean?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29770","Robin","Well, no matter how bad things got... Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29771","Barney","Yeah... he did. And... she loved him, too. Didn't she?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"

"29774","Jake","So, let me show you some of the gut-wrenching environmental atrocities that we were working to stop, okay? Here, pop quiz. What is that?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29775","Marshall","That's a seal.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29776","Jake","Bingo! Yes, a bloated seal corpse rotting in industrial waste.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"

"29780","Barney","Maybe this isn't the intersection.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29781","Robin","Well, maybe it is and we're too late. Man, I wish we'd gone to Brooklyn sooner.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29782","Man","I know, right? Ever since the Trader Joe's opened up, Brooklyn is so... whatever.","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29783","Robin","Wait. Where'd you get that? (The guy is holding a cup, on which is printed ""The Intersection"")","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29784","Man","Across the street at the Intersection. So, uh, you guys... want to buy some weed or...?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"
"29785","Barney","She's alone! There's still time! But where the hell is Ted?","06","24","Challenge Accepted"

"29838","Ted","The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage.","07","01","The Best Man"
"29839","Barney","I'm not scared. It's just that I think once I'd put this tie, I could never remove it. I should wear it again and again. And of course this tie is fine now, but how I will cope when it becomes big and it annoy me? Do I made a mistake? Is what I would have been happier with the other tie?

"29856","Ted","These marriages have become associated as the worst moment of my life. The love between Joel and Mora is magnificent. I thought I had the same thing... Until my fiancee left me at the altar last week. I was asked not to talk about that, so I will not do. I sit in front of her home at night sometimes. It changed hairstyle. (In 2009...) After losing my job last week, I asked not to give this toast... (A man tries to take her microphone) No, no, no! The happy couple should hear. It's over. But from the ashes of your divorce statistically probable, hope can be reborn. That is why I opened my own architectural firm Mosbius Designs. (3 months later...) Mosbius Designs went bankrupt. But the love of Alex and Jessica reminds us that... Oh, my God!","07","01","The Best Man"
"29857","Punchy","A Schmosby classic.","07","01","The Best Man"

"29994","Robin","You've been too focused on your work.","07","01","The Best Man"
"29995","Ted","No, it's more than that. I stopped believing. Not like some depressed, I cry during my speech. Not the way I had not even noticed, until tonight.

"30056","Garrison","Marshall, it's Garrison Cootes. Sorry for not having reminded you earlier but I was stuck. What's funny, because I'm literally stuck in a swamp.

"30077","Ted","I just had two rencards following. With two adorable girls, four cappuccinos and wait... (2 minutes later...) I do not know which was the best. Here are the girls  Jessica is a student in Rhode Island, she traveled around the world, speaks four languages and plays the piano. Claire and fought for the bill. So I do not know. It is torture.

"30178","Lily","Oh, dear. You're still drunk. I can not believe that I made the bet.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30179","Marshall","Just to be clear, ""I've done it again!""... Am not referring to my current state of inebriation.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30180","Lily","What does it therefore reference?","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30181","Marshall","My name is Marshall Eriksen. I'm 33 and if my potential future employer, Garrison Cootes, look at this... Prostrate to Biercules!","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30182","Lily","Well... it could be anyone...","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30183","Pete","Oh, God...","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30184","Lily","Pete, it's Lily Aldrin. I'll be brief. You're going out this video of Marshall. You know why? Because I am friends with three girls with whom you came to school, and girls say it all together. Every small detail.Huh. So... tick, tick... Pete so goes the clock in the little dick.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30185","Ted","Pete has a small dick?","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30186","Lily","I have no idea. Well, what do you take?","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30187","Marshall","It had to happen eventually. I tried so hard to suppress my... ""side-idiot-who-is-not-care-for nothing"" he rebelled and has struggled!","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30188","Robin","It's for sure!","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30189","Marshall's voice","Look at me! I am a windmill!","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30190","Marshall","Who do I crazy? I'm not ready to be a father. I thought I was, but it's like... My father never did such things, you know?","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30191","Lily","But if he did, you would love all the same. And to be honest, you do not love to come across a video of him running down the street naked shouting, ""Hey, Marshall, look at me! I have a stalactite on the head! ""","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30192","Barney","Oh! Hi guys! Oh! My neck! Uh... oh! Hey! Look at this!","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30193","Robin","Barney, what are you doing here?","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30194","Barney","Oh, I told Nora that I would not leave until I have no second appointment, and I intend to do. I am here since 9 o'clock. I still need another minute. Say I'm crazy, but I'll stay here as long as it will not be returned.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30195","Ted","That's what I want. Barney's feelings for Nora, I want to feel again. I do not want to choose between two girls. I want to be completely baba one of the two.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30196","Lily","Yes, the stupid thing that makes us turn the head, pretty cool.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30197","Marshall","It's not bad. Also, for posterity, a statement drunk guy! I would not drink again.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30198","Ted (2030)","And of course...","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30199","Marshall","Carpet Biercules! Yeah!","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30200","Ted (2030)","But again, I digress.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30201","Marshall","Hello?","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30202","Garrison","Marshall! Garrison Cootes.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30203","Marshall","Yes, Mr Cootes. How are you?","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30204","Garrison","I wanted you to know we had conducted our inquiries, and there is something annoying.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30205","Marshall","Sir, the fact is that...","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30206","Garrison","The rainbow in this sample is definitely related to chemical plants. Ok, I... Skip a line... We love you! It takes you.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30207","Marshall","It's fantastic. Thank you, Mr Cootes.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30208","Garrison","Well, nothing. Oh, and when you're in the office, try to wear something Biercules. Ok? Wow, that was a big snake.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30209","Marshall","Oh, there was a snake in the swamp?","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30210","Garrison","No, I was talking about your pen1s. See you tomorrow.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30211","Marshall","I got the job.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30212","Lily","Yes!","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30213","Marshall","And I think my boss is already sexually harassing me. But he saw the video and he does not care!","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30214","Lily","Saw what? Maybe the video is not so bad after all.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30215","Marshall","Yes. Hello?","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30216","Pete","Hey Marshall, I'm Pete Durkenson. We all went to Wesleyan.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30217","Marshall","Yes, no, I know. Pete, we drank together yesterday.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30218","Pete","Absolutely, now, the message from Lily makes sense. Listen, do not worry Bro ', I remove the video.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30219","Marshall","You know what? Let her.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30220","Pete","As you wish, Biercules. (He hangs up and is in an operating room with a man on the table) Scalpel.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30221","Marshall","You know what? That's good. I want my children to see every part of me.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30222","Lily","Yes. Even the side where you route the East Village naked.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30223","Marshall","I will remember Pete.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30224","Lily","It's a good idea.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30225","Ted (2030)","That night, I brought Robin Bal.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30226","Robin","Thanks for taking me.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30227","Ted","The pleasure is mine. And you know, you might find it interesting.Some of these guys represent the history of New York.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30228","Robin","Yes, yes. Where is Lenny Kravitz?","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30229","Ted","Right there. Leonard Kravitz, world-renowned architect. This guy is a star. He will make his famous reading of 90 minutes on the beams.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30230","Robin","Well, great. I'll go find one myself and hang myself.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30231","Ted","Ok","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30232","Ted (2030)","Children, you can not control when falling in love. It does not take days to think about. When this happens, you know quickly and with absolute certainty. I had forgotten. But reminded myself it was going.","07","02","The Naked Truth"
"30233","Marshall","Oh my God, guys, I still have a hangover. Did I really ruin a marriage?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30234","Ted","No, you did not ruin a marriage. Only reception.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30235","Robin","And Miztva Bar next door.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30236","Lily","And my dress. And your dress. You put a dress at one point.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30237","Marshall","Ok, you know what, it's good. I'll be a father, and I want to be the kind of man that my child can watch. Therefore, new resolution... I will never drunk! I'm serious!","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30238","Ted (2030)","Children, this is not your Uncle Marshall was a problem with the drink. But every time he was a good resolution, we knew about that...","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30239","Marshall","I've done it again!","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30240","Ted (2030)","But I lost a bit in the story.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30241","Lily","What happened to your leg?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30242","Barney","Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some ""sympathy points"". She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of ""Man of La Mancha."" What do you think?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30243","Ted","Lose the cast.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30244","Barney","A one-man show... I love it!","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30245","Lily","Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30246","Barney","You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon. I trained all day with these crutches and one who has left in my hall is likely to need it.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30247","Ted","Well, I have good news. As you know, I recently decided to start out and see the girls.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30248","Woman","Is this you?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30249","Ted","Uh, yes. Salvation. I'm Ted.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30250","Woman","Hi.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30251","Lily","That's great, Ted.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30252","Ted","It was a completely random moment. The kind that you can create yourself... At least I thought.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30253","Ted","Oh, no. How have I landed on it? Salvation. Ted Mosby. (With another woman) I plead guilty. Salvation. Ted Mosby. (And another) It's embarrassing. I will be on the cover of ""An egg on my face"" magazine. But I'm not. I'm on the cover of that one. Salvation. Ted Mosby.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30254","Ted","completely random 16 times in one day, and 16 of these, 10 were single. Of these 10, seven have loved what they saw. Of these seven, four were women. And these four, two have given me their real number. And I go with both.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30255","Marshall","Guys, this is Garrison Cootes.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30256","Ted (2030)","Children, Garrison Cootes was a major partner of Honeywell & Cootes. One of the largest environmental law firms in the United States.Marshall would have given anything to work there.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30257","Marshall","If I did not work, I could finish... in kind, a Taco Belle somewhere. And nobody wants that. Unless you want to do this, like this you would have free tacos, since you are my friends. But now I need you all calmiez! (He finally won) Hello.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30258","Garrison","Marshall, it's Garrison Cootes. Sorry for not having reminded you earlier but I was stuck. What's funny, because I'm literally stuck in a swamp. Well, anyway, here I am trying to collect some samples for this trial on the pollution that we are working.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30259","Marshall","I love the work you do.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30260","Garrison","It's a...","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30261","Marshall","No, I mean it.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30262","Garrison","No, no, there is a crocodile a few meters from me. So I'll just ignore the warm urine running down my leg right now, and tell you that we are very interested in your case.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30263","Marshall","He's interested!","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30264","Garrison","Obviously, we need to do some sort of verification purpose, you see, an investigation of crime and a Google search, but if nothing seems wrong to us, it takes you.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30265","Marshall","It's fantastic, Mr Cootes!","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30266","Garrison","Well, I'm going. It's very funny because in fact I really have run away.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30267","Marshall","The crocodile you saw?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30268","Garrison","He is coming, yes.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30269","Ted (2030)","The next night, Barney and Nora saw each other for a coffee.Fortunately, without the neck brace ridiculous.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30270","Barney","Hi Nora, thank you for coming.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30271","Nora","What happened to your neck?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30272","Barney","My naked...? Oh, that's nothing. I was playing in a One Man Show at Fiddler. There was this scene...","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30273","Nora","Wow, this one has a beautiful chest.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30274","Barney, turning","What? Where? Oh, and sh1t.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30275","Nora","Breasts...","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30276","Barney","Wait, Nora, waiting... No, please. I'm sorry.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30277","Nora","What is wrong with you? What kind of people need to lie like that?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30278","Barney","Someone who likes you, really. And suspicious, and probably accurately you do it over more later, and therefore he feels the need... I'm sorry, you spoke of this fantastic pair of tits, right? Because I seek, and I do not see them.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30279","Ted","I just had two rencards following. With two adorable girls, four cappuccinos and wait... (2 minutes later...) I do not know which was the best. Here are the girls  Jessica is a student in Rhode Island, she traveled around the world, speaks four languages and plays the piano. Claire and fought for the bill. So I do not know. It is torture. You see, the two girls have the potential to be really special. They both deserve a second round.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30280","Lily","Wait a minute. You're going to handle two girls at once? You do not think you should pick one before it gets too serious?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30281","Ted","Define ""serious"".","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30282","Lily","Well, it's complicated. I think it would be when you have expectations, emotional involvement...","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30283","Marshall","Third base. Seriously, third base.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30284","Ted","So I can go to the second two with no problem?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30285","Marshall","Treat yourself my friend. Treat yourself. Oh no.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30286","Ted (2030)","Since Mr. Cootes had mentioned the investigation, Marshall ran through internet. The majority of what he found was touching, seeing truly extraordinary, until...","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30287","Marshall","Poor. This is very bad.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30288","Girl","Thank you, Stacy. Wesleyan has a cafeteria. Thank you to the generous donation of... Marshall arrives on camera, naked.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30289","Marshall","Oh! Oh! Someone there mentioned generous donation? I'm Marshall Eriksen. But you can call me Biercules!","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30290","Lily","Well, it could be anyone. And thin, I had forgotten this story Biercules.Who made this site first?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30291","Marshall","Pete Durkenson.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30292","Ted","Of course.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30293","Robin","This is the guy who convinced you to run around campus naked?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30294","Marshall","I wanted to join a club that I left three days later, because the clubs are stupid and elitist. And I also discovered that it was not a club.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30295","Ted","Oh my God. This is huge! I am invited to the Ball of Architects, the annual gala honoring the greatest architects of the city. Oh no. You guys see the problem?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30296","Robin","This is an annual gala that honors the greatest architects of the city?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30297","Ted","Robin, this is the biggest celebrity event of the year. In taking a girl at the ball, man, you reached third base. Whatever the girl I invite, it will be the steady girlfriend of Ted Mosby by the end of the evening. Ok, we stop to sit between two chairs. Robin, bring me my notebook. It's time to make lists of pros and cons.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30298","Ted (2030)","And the children they loved.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30299","Nora","Let me clarify something for you. I do not date guys who lie to me.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30300","Barney","Okay, I did not know. Mea culpa. So, from now, more lies. I never lie to you. I'm serious. Ask me anything.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30301","Nora","OK Have you ever managed to get in bed with a woman that you lied?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30302","Barney","Have I ever... If I'm totally honest... Yes.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30303","Nora","More than once?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30304","Barney","More than once... Wow, this is... I guess if we... so, technically, there were a number of times I've lied to a woman to sleep with her.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30305","Nora","They were worth what?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30306","Barney","Nine or ten for most. There has been a 4 once. It was an easy girl.But, Nora, after that, I had to flee so fast. Honesty is good.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30307","Nora","What was the lie?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30308","Barney","You want me to tell all the lies I have told to put a woman in my bed?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30309","Nora","A bed or any other place where you're sent into the air.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30310","Barney","You are good.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30311","Marshall","Pete, Pete. Hey!","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30312","Pete","Biercules! Come here, man.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30313","Marshall","Hey, I tried to call you all night.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30314","Pete","My God, sorry. I should have responded but it was Thursday night.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30315","Marshall","It is Sunday.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30316","Pete","And you know what that means. ""Edward bottles with money""!","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30317","Ted (2030)","Children, Edward bottles for money is a game that involves taping two bottles of liquor at the base of the hands. The goal is to finish the two bottles. Oh my God, why am I telling you this? Good move.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30318","Marshall","Ok, you know this old video of me?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30319","Pete","I watch it every day.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30320","Marshall","You have to take away the internet. Genre immediately.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30321","Pete","There are two ways for me to do it  Either you give me $ 4 million, or help me to go to the bathroom because I can not...","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30322","Marshall","Yes, both are non-negotiable refusal.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30323","Pete","So, I'm sorry we could not handle together. But if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of the game ""to Edward bottles of money,"" and the competition is raised.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30324","Marshall","Who are you playing anyway?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30325","Pete","Just myself.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30326","Ted (2030)","Meanwhile, Barney continued to list every lie he used to sleep.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30327","Barney","I do not have time to explain how I got there. I just need someone to suck the poison. The surgeon gave me a new face, darling. You realize that I am alive? My name is David Beckham. If I castais only the white swan, is the role for you. No, I am a lesbian. What I wear is just very realistic.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30328","Nora","Ok, let's move. What was the worst? The best of the worst? The cream of the crop?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30329","Barney","Oh, once I am the soul man. There was this pretty girl who only go out with black.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30330","Woman","Barney! Oh no, I knew it.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30331","Ted","I can not choose. They are both extraordinary.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30332","Robin","If architects had only two bullets, eh Ted?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30333","Lily","I knew it. Ted, left or right?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30334","Ted","Yes, yes, good idea. Let fate decide? I will choose the left.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30335","Lily, slapping him","Just called one of the two.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30336","Robin","Ted, to your heart, you know that you love one more than the other.Believe me, takes the other.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30337","Ted","Uh, I have perhaps not been clear is the... Robin Ball Architects.This event is a very hip.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30338","Robin","Ok, name one celebrity who will be there.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30339","Ted","Lenny Kravitz.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30340","Robin","Lenny Kravitz will be there?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30341","Ted","Yes. He is there every year. And it's a rock star.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30342","Robin","You know, Ted, in hindsight, it is too early to choose between these two girls. Takes a friend. Like, I dunno, maybe a friend who has a poster of Lenny Kravitz on his wall, and may or may not have dated this post and transported from his high school...","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30343","Ted","This list of pros and cons leads to nothing. I need a color scale.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30344","Lily and Robin","Scale of colors!","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30345","Ted (2030)","And the children, we really sang.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30346","Marshall","Pete, please. I am unemployed. I have a huge mortgage. A baby arriving. And I'm about to lose a job that I really need because of a drunken video of 15 years ago.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30347","Pete","Ugh, you mean? Biercules, what's going on? Looks like you're another person. The guy in this video was cool. It had potential. It could have been president of a club one day.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30348","Marshall","There is no club.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30349","Pete","There he is just a troublemaker.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30350","Marshall","It's not that I want to be a troublemaker. Fair, I must be one. I'll be a dad. You have children one day, you will understand.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30351","Pete","Dude, I have 4 children.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30352","Marshall","Pete, please, remove the video.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30353","Pete","Ok, Biercules, I will remove it. If... you can beat me to the game of my choice.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30354","Marshall","Oh no.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30355","Pete","And I choose the beautiful game, the sweet science...","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30356","Marshall","Pete, please, I'm tired...","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30357","Pete","The sport of kings...","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30358","Marshall","I do not want to play Edward bottles money.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30359","Pete","I was going to the darts, but it's Edward bottles to money!","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30360","Barney","And that made all the lies related to space. Let the world of sports. Oh wait, I forgot for a space  ""I was bitten by a snake space. You have to suck all the poison around my... ""","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30361","Nora","Okay, Barney, I have things to work tomorrow at 8 am which means I have just enough time to spend 11h in my shower to wash away all that.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30362","Barney","So that was cool. I can remember, or...?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30363","Nora","Barney, you're funny, beautiful, and really nice. But you are also a sociopath.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30364","Barney","Well, I count three for and one against.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30365","Nora","How can you still believe you have a chance with me?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30366","Barney","Because you are sat here all night. You could leave, but you did not. Listen, Nora, these lies, it was the old me. But I swear I try to change.You... make me want to change.","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30367","Nora","How I know this is not a lie?","07","03","Ducky Tie"
"30368","Barney","I will prove it. I'll show you how much I'm serious. I will not leave this restaurant as I have not got a second date with you.","07","03","Ducky Tie"

"30381","Marshall","Just to be clear, ""I've done it again!""... Am not referring to my current state of inebriation.","07","03","Ducky Tie"

"30386","Lily","Pete, it's Lily Aldrin. I'll be brief. You're going out this video of Marshall. You know why?

"30393","Lily","But if he did, you would love all the same. And to be honest, you do not love to come across a video of him running down the street naked shouting, ""Hey, Marshall, look at me! I have a stalactite on the head! ""","07","03","Ducky Tie"
