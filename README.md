# Data science 3

This repository contains codes and materials used during the Data science 3 course at Central European University. 
In this project I scraped all the transcripts for the tv series **How I met your mother** and then conducted some natural languague analysis on the data such as sentiment analysis, topic modelling and looking at unique words and vocabulary used by the different characters.
